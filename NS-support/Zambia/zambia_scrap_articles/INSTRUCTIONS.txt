# three scripts to scrap, analyze articles and convert them into a list of events

# 1) scrap_articles
# get articles from various Zambian newspapers.
# N.B. some parts need to be configured by hand for each website.
# To be implemented: configure things automatically.
# output: pandas dataframe of articles
# row format: ['title', 'publish_date', 'text', 'url']

# 2) inspect_articles_tag_topical
# analyze the output of scrap_articles and decide if each article is relevant or not
# add a corresponding boolean to the dataframe
# To be implemented: automatize the process with a classification algorithm, too few data so far

# 3) convert_articles_to_database_events
# analyze relevant articles and build a dataframe of events
# row format: ['event_type', 'date', 'locations', 'source']
# save to csv
