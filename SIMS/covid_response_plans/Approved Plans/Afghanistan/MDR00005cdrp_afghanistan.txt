Needs analysis: First, in general, poverty rates in Afghanistan continue to rise as a result of continued conflict, climate change, and the added challenges created by cross 
border arrivals on already stretched economies and systems. Based on the 2020 Humanitarian Needs Overview, in 2020, 8.21 million vulnerable people are in need of urgent 
food and livelihoods assistance in the country. A recent nutrition survey across Afghanistan indicated that 22 out of 34 provinces are currently above the emergency level 
threshold for acute malnutrition. 
 
The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has made the already worse situation of the country more deteriorating. The shocks and stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic is having a much 
broader impact on the socio- economic of the vulnerable households and will not only diminished the well-being and livelihoods of people, but also undermined the markets and 
food security on which life depends. In Afghanistan, the COVID-19 outbreak comes against the backdrop of the Spring flood season. Each year, floods affect large swathes of 
the country as heavy snow melts and rivers swell, inundating communities. Heavy rainfall also contributes to flash flooding. The typical flood season runs from March to June 
each year. In 2020, some 200,000 people are expected to be affected only by floods. 
  
The shocks of COVID-19 will also have impacts on labour markets, purchasing power and lost productivity – all of which are significant factors for Afghanistan, not least because 
few Afghans have access to productive or sustainable remunerative employment. A quarter of the labour force is unemployed, and 80 percent of employment is ‘vulnerable’ 
and insecure, comprising self-employment, day labour, or unpaid work. There are also growing concerns that due to price increases and future movement restrictions, farmers’ 
and  herders’  access  to  farming  inputs  may  be  hampered,  reducing  their  ability  to  successfully  grow  summer  crops  (mostly  vegetables  and  pulses),  sell  produce  and 
vaccinate/treat their livestock. 
 
It is also important to note that Afghanistan’s economy and millions of families have grown reliant on remittances from Iran. Currency devaluations over the past year have 
resulted in a drop in the value of such remittances but the surge in returns and COVID-19 interruptions to work opportunities in Iran will further diminish the purchasing power 
of many communities who have been heavily reliant on remittance payments over recent years. This will have a severe impact on vulnerable families. 
 
Within this broader context, and considering the direct impact of COVID-19 on food, nutrition, and livelihoods security of especially the poor and most vulnerable households 
(households in IPC phase 3 and 4, and IDP and returnee households both in urban and rural areas), IFRC intends to support the ARCS provide food assistance and multi-
purpose cash assistance to the households that will be quarantined, households that will be under treatments, or households that will lose their incomes due to the COVID-
19. In addition, ARCS will also be supported in recruiting the food suppliers, so that the food suppliers should supply food directly to the homes of the households that will be 
quarantined and that cannot access market to purchase food.

Risk analysis: The following risks are anticipated with implementing the activities planned under the livelihoods and basic needs component of this Domestic Response 
Plan.  
 
Quarantined groups have difficulty accessing distribution site and/or local markets: the quarantined individuals and households and other vulnerable groups (persons 
with disabilities, elderly, etc.), who face problems accessing the distribution sites or local markets will receive their cash in their locations. Furthermore, the local food vendors 
willing to transport food items to local areas will also be contracted and used. 
 
Diversion of assistance to non-eligible or non-beneficiaries: IFRC will support the ARCS in conducting verification of beneficiary lists before finalization to ensure the 
households are eligible. Beneficiaries will be verified during cash distributions (i.e. ID check to verify they are the intended recipient) and ARCS will seek to ensure that there 
is a context-specific identity verification process at the distribution site. The engagement of community elders and other community-based networks will reduce the risk of fake 
beneficiary inclusion. Furthermore, IFRC will also support ARCS in establishing community-based feedback and complaint mechanism that will allow the beneficiaries and 
non-beneficiaries share their voices / feedback / complaints with ARCS. 
 
Transfer  value  is  insufficient  to  cover  food  or  other  basic  needs  due  to  market  price  fluctuations:  IFRC  will  support  ARCS  to  regularly  monitor  the  market  prices 
especially the prices of food items. In addition, close and systematic coordination with relevant clusters such as the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster and the Cash and 
Voucher Working Group will also enable IFRC and ARCS receive up to date market related information from these sources. In case of significant increase in food other basic 
need market prices, IFRC and ARCS will remain flexible in changing the transfer value. 
 
Population to be assisted: under this Emergency Appeal, IFRC and ARCS intend to provide emergency food assistance and multiple cash grants to the financially 
most vulnerable households that will lose their incomes due to being quarantined or the broader impact of the COVID-19. 
 
Programme standards/benchmarks: IFRC and ARCS, to implement the planned livelihoods and basic needs assistance activities under this Emergency Appeal, will 
consider and apply the programming standards of the relevant clusters (i.e. Afghanistan Food Security Cluster and Cash and Voucher Working Group), and the Ministry of 
Public Health of Afghanistan.

Needs analysis: The overall operational objective is to contribute to reduce the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 outbreak by preventing or slowing transmission of the 
virus across Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. Adjusted to a moderate-transmission scenario (40,000 confirmed cases), response strategies must however be adaptable to a changing 
epidemiology. Given the different challenges faced in urban and non-urban settings including access and security, the response must be continuously adapted to fit the evolution 
of the outbreak and of the new areas affected including increasing the use of mobile health teams, decentralizing and localizing response activities and use of rapid response 
teams while taking into account the psychosocial dimension on vulnerable communities.  
 
In support of ARCS priorities and commitments under the MoPH, IFRC Domestic Response Plan will focus its efforts on equipping and supporting ARCS health facilities and 
outreach in communities with a focus on: 

•  Procuring and providing protective equipment for staff and volunteers as absolute priority.  
•  Supporting the supply chain to operationalize ARCS hospital/isolation capacities for case management. 
•  Providing medical and non-medical materials to ARCS health teams (clinics, mobile teams, etc.) to support screening, contact tracing and community outreach as part 

of the nation-wide surveillance efforts.  

•  Risk communication activities to share timely and trustworthy information, address misinformation and build knowledge, acceptance and intention about signs and 

symptoms, transmission modes, preventive actions (handwashing and social distancing).  

•  Community engagement approaches with focus on targeted public engagement (through media), community feedback systems, volunteers dialogue and community 
level activities (through/ with key influencers) to address fear, enhance trust and promote community-led solutions to prevent and control the outbreak (closely linking 
health and PSSMH activities).  

•  Ensuring the mainstreaming of PGI in emergencies across health response, including for Sexual and gender-based violence prevention and child protection. 
•  Facilitating care for people who cannot access health and other essential services due to social  exclusion, other barriers to  access, or during shutdown  of public 

services, public transportation, etc.  

 
Risk analysis: In case of accelerated and uncontrolled transmission of the virus affecting frontline responders could result in proportionally reduced response capacities. The 
risk is particularly high for large populations concentrated in cities, especially in informal urban settlements without adequate water and waste management and deficiencies in 
public health infrastructures. Security risks and impeded access remain permanent as the response takes place in a protracted crisis context marked by more than 18 years of 
conflict. 
 
Population to be assisted:  

•  Preparedness and containment activities will focus on enhanced engagement of ARCS health facilities and engagement of communities at risk of transmission, in 

urban settings and hard-to-reach areas. 

•  Mitigation and risk reduction activities will be focused on ensuring the most vulnerable and excluded groups have access to essential services  
•  Priority communities across all phases of the outbreak will include:

People targeted: 190,000 
Male: 96,330 
Female: 93,670 
Requirements (CHF): 529,724 

 

 
Needs analysis: Community people are unaware on water purification methods for safe drinking while sanitation management systems and hygiene practices remain weak 
and sub-standard across the country, including on handwashing. Gaps in WASH need to be addressed as critical part of the emergency response to the pandemic.  
 
Risk analysis: One of the key risks of spreading of COVID-19 is due to poor hygiene especially hand washing. In Afghanistan this risk is very high due to lack of health 
knowledge, poor economic status and water supply.     
 
Population  to  be  assisted:  Preparedness  and  containment  activities  will  focus  on  hygiene  promotion  in  most  at-risk  communities,  while  building  the  capacity  and 
relationships needed for ARCS and volunteers to effectively respond. Priority communities across all phases of the outbreak will include: 

Internal Displaced Population (IDPs). 

• 
•  Refugees/ returnees. 
•  Hard-to-reach, white and insecure areas. 
•  Remote and isolated communities. 

 
Programme standards/benchmarks: The aim of WASH interventions under this sectoral component is to promote good personal and environmental hygiene as barriers 
to virus transmission. WASH activities in targeted provinces will be conducted in collaboration with MoPH and other humanitarian actors in accordance with the Sphere Standards 
as well as IFRC WASH for hygiene promotion in emergency operations and IFRC MHM guide and tools.

Protection, Gender and Inclusion 
People targeted: 150,000 
Male: 76,050 
Female: 73,950 
Requirements (CHF): 298,200 

 

 
Protection needs: This response is taking place across the country with a high rate of gender-based violence, marginalization of a number of populations and presence of 
extremely vulnerable groups. The major needs in this sector include ensuring all populations  the most vulnerable people are reached by COVID-19 response and preparedness 
activities; training of ARCS volunteers and staff on key areas including prevention and response to sexual and gender-based violence as well as protection against sexual 
exploitation and abuse. The PGI activities will be implemented for both COVID-19 response and preparedness in all provinces across the country. Vulnerable population in 
Afghanistan such as women, children, elderly, persons with disabilities and the sick are at higher risk of exploitation. There is a need to protect this population and incorporate 
their  different needs into the programming. Protection needs in the complex  emergency in Afghanistan  are mainly related to the deteriorating security situation  and forced 
population movements. Children are at particular risk of abuse, neglect, marginalization, and exploitation. Holistic approaches aimed at improving the resilience and self-reliance 
of affected households, as well as enhancing positive engagement of governance structures to reduce vulnerabilities and to mitigate short and longer-term protection risks. 
Timely identification of protection risks through systematic and coordinated protection monitoring and analysis will inform preventative, responsive, and remedial interventions, 
as well as enhance accountability. This includes evidence-based advocacy, protection specific service delivery, and community-based mobilization, mitigation, and prevention 
activities creating a protection-conducive environment.  
 
ARCS and IFRC will coordinate with protection and gender-based violence clusters in western, central, northern and eastern regions. Stronger linkages with protection clusters 
are also sought on relevant issues of common interest, such as the development of a comprehensive disability and assistance survivor support strategy and response; enhanced 
operational and planning integration of PGI across the emergency response. 
 
Risk analysis: The PGI risks are cross cutting in nature. The programme staff often overlook the softer issues in relation to inclusiveness, protection and gender sensitivity 
while undertaking community-based livelihoods activities in affected areas.  
 
Population to be assisted: All the people involved/assisted in either relief phase and through any sectoral interventions, must include PGI lenses, especially in beneficiary 
selection, delivery of interventions, monitoring and reporting. As an essential crosscutting theme for all RCRC emergency operations, the operation targets all beneficiaries with 
a PGI driven approach.  
 
Program standards/benchmarks: PGI approaches will be aligned with the IFRC Minimum Standard to Protection, Gender and Inclusion in Emergency Programming, the 
IASC Gender-Based Violence Guidelines. The IFRC  MSs  have been developed based  on  (but not  limited  to) the  Sphere handbook and  the Minimum Standards for  Child 
Protection in Humanitarian Action. The Protection, Gender and Inclusion Area of Focus of the emergency appeal is complimentary to the Response Priority 1 of the One Window 
Framework.

Strategies for Implementation 
Requirements (CHF): 4,349,305 

 
Based on the demand for the technical and coordination support required for this operation, the following programme support functions will be put in place or maintained to 
ensure an effective and efficient technical coordination: human resources, logistics and supply chain; information technology support (IT); communications; security; planning, 
monitoring, evaluation and reporting (PMER); partnerships and resource development; finance and administration; and information management (IM). A core emphasis of the 
strategy  is  to  strengthen  the  National  Society  in  the  above-mentioned  areas.  The  regional  coordination  strategy  and  plans,  in  addition  to  providing  technical  and  strategic 
guidance, further allows for the coordination and overview needed for monitoring, reviews and a final evaluation of the operation. Core assumptions, the context and impact, 
operational constraints, and priority needs continuous assessments will be carried out by the ARCS staff and volunteers as well as IFRC operational staff in the targeted area. 
 
Several related guidance and additional tools are or have been adapted, revised or updated, in particular for business continuity planning, which establishes the basis for 
National Societies to ensure the continuous functioning of key services during the crisis in all relevant locations. It includes also a plan to recover and resume business processes 
when programmes have been disrupted unexpectedly. Beside activities ensuring the duty of care for staff and volunteers, special focus is also put on back-up measures for 
defined services of the National Societies.
