A. Situation analysis 
 
Description of the disaster  
 
On 31 December 2019, Wuhan city in China reported cases of pneumonia of unknown origin, which was later confirmed 
to be caused by a new coronavirus now known as SARS-CoV-02 which causes the disease COVID-19. Since then, 
COVID-19 has since been declared by WHO as global pandemic on 11 March, currently affecting 206 countries and 
territories around the world.  
 
As of 20 April 2020, more than 2.4 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally. While more than 629,000 
people have recovered,  the death toll keeps growing with up to 165,000 deaths reported,  predominantly in the USA 
(40,565), Italy (23,660), Spain (20,453), France (19,718), United-Kingdom (16,060) and Iran (5,118).China and South 
Korea, initially two of the most affected countries, seem to have controlled the spread of the virus, concerns are growing 
as the pandemic is expanding in fragile contexts where health and socio-economic systems are not equipped to capture 
or absorb a massive pandemic shock.  
 
In Afghanistan, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) reported the first confirmed case on 24 February 2020 located in 
the western province of Herat, at the border with Iran. Herat has become since then the hotspot of the country due to its 
proximity with the Iranian border which has been crossed by more than 200,000 Afghan returnees since February 2020 
and became the main vectors of COVID-19 imported cases across the country.

As of 20 April, MoPH data shows that 996 people across 30 provinces were confirmed to have the virus, for 33 reported 
deaths while 131 people had recovered from the virus. The case fatality rate was 3.4 per cent. More people had acquired 
the virus inside Afghanistan than had brought it from other affected countries. Men between the ages of 40-69 represent 
60  per  cent  of  all  COVID-19  related  deaths.  Cases  were  expected  to  increase  rapidly  over  the  weeks  ahead  as 
community  transmission  escalates,  creating  grave  implications  for  Afghanistan’s  economy  and  people’s  well-being. 
Herat was still the most affected part of the country.

A pandemic of potential disastrous proportions in the Afghan context 
It is acknowledged that the COVID-19 caseload in Afghanistan only captures a fraction of the real impact of the pandemic 
in  the  country.  Until  20  April,  the  Afghan  Ministry  of  Public  Health  (MoPH)  reported  that  only  6,422  tests  had  been 
conducted. In war-torn Afghanistan, the overall health system is not equipped to absorb the shocks of a major pandemic 
as suffering from systemic weaknesses in terms of human resources, financial resources and infrastructures. On 20 
April,  the  testing  capacity  for  the  coronavirus  had  been  slowly  increased  up  to  1,000  tests  a  day  through  eight 
laboratories. This remains largely insufficient compared to required standards and imperative to systematically track, 
test and treat.  
 
Towards the end of March, the Afghan Ministry of Public Health estimated that 25.6 million Afghans (approximately 80 
per cent of the population) could be infected and 110,000 Afghans might die from COVID-19. If that estimate is borne 
out, the casualties from the virus would be much higher than the total civilian casualties of the more than 18-year war.  
 
The Emergency Response Plan adopted by the Afghan Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) on 24 March 2020 envisions 
three possible scenarios for the country: 

1.  Low-transmission scenario (based on the model analyzed in Hubei, China) would envision already a caseload 
of 40,000 people early April for a total fatality of 1,383 people and more than 9,000 hospitalized. This would 
however require massive mobilization and availability of protective equipment and medical materials as well as 
aggressive  measures  to  find,  test,  isolate  and  treat  cases,  and  trace  contacts  –  a  capacity  which  is  not  in 
Afghanistan’s  immediate  reach  due  to  multiple  shortages  and  fragile  systems  across  the  country.  However, 
ARCS have the capacity to mobilize more than 600 staff through its health facilities as well as between 4,000 
to  6,000  volunteers.  The  blocking  factor  for  scalable  mobilization  is  the  lack  of  PPEs  and  the  systemic 
weaknesses of the local market for meeting the needs along acceptable quality standards.

2.  Moderate-transmission  scenario  which  forecasts  more  than  190,000  cases,  mortality  at  5,716  and  38,205 
persons  to  be  hospitalized.  This  scenario  supposes  full  compliance  to  social  distancing  and  preventive 
measures as well as strengthened health systems and capacities over a period of eight months. 

3.  High-transmission scenario look into a grimmer picture of more than 16 million people infected, a total fatality 
110,000 persons, and 738,000 persons in need of hospitalization. This scenario is developed based on global 
studies of the pattern of disease in other countries. In this scenario, 80 per cent of the total population would be 
affected, out of which 66 per cent of the infected people would be symptomatic. From the total symptomatic 
cases 4.4 per cent of the patients require hospitalization from which 30 per cent will be in the critical stage. 

4.  The COVID-19 outbreak will make the already worse situation of the country more deteriorating. The shocks 
and  stresses  of  this  pandemic  will  have  a  much  broader  impact  on  the  socio-economic  of  the  vulnerable 
households and will not only diminished the well-being and livelihoods of people, but also has undermined the 
markets and food security on which life depends. The shocks of COVID-19 will also have impacts on labour 
markets, purchasing power and lost productivity – all of which are significant factors for Afghanistan, not least 
because few Afghans have access to productive or sustainable remunerative employment. 

 
While the moderate transmission scenario has been considered as the most likely and the one to prepare for, the high-
transmission scenario is not excluded. More fine-tuned scenarios are being worked out by MoPH for planning purposes 
that contemplate at least 40,000 hospitalizations until June. 
 
An expected widespread humanitarian impact due to pre-existing high vulnerabilities 
The  pandemic takes place against the  backdrop of already deeply  deteriorated  socio-economic conditions  while  the 
ability of millions of people to cope with the crisis has been eroded from past shocks:  

•  More than 50 per cent of the population are living with less than USD 1 a day, or even a week.  
• 

In 2020, 8.21 million vulnerable people are in need of urgent food and livelihoods assistance to reduce food 
consumption gaps, protect livelihoods and reduce malnutrition (Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) 2020). 

•  Around  14.28  million  people  are  estimated  to  be  in  crisis  or  emergency  levels  of  food  insecurity  in  the  first 

months of 2020.  

•  More than 2.5 million people are internally displaced across Afghanistan due to both disasters and protracted 

conflict. Many millions more are living as refugees in neighbouring countries, and across the globe.  

•  A recent survey on nutrition conducted across Afghanistan indicated that 22 out of 34 provinces are currently 
above  the  emergency  level  threshold  for  acute  malnutrition.  The  impacts  of  2018-2019  drought  further 
aggravating an already poor nutritional situation in the country (HRP 2020). 

•  62.7 per cent of the urban population in Afghanistan are living in informal settlements according to data collected 

by the World Bank in 2014 3. 

 
The restrictions and lockdown measures adopted in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries are expected to result in 
steady increase of food prices. Spikes in prices have already been observed on some key food items such as wheat, 
wheat flour, and cooking oil relative to COVID-19 impacts. For example, the price of wheat has increased by 15 per cent 
between 14 March – 2 April 2020. Potential supply disruptions of key food commodities (such as wheat flour and wheat 
grains) from Kazakhstan could further aggravate the possible negative economic impacts. The poorest households will 
suffer disproportionally from potential food price spikes with urban areas hit the hardest. 
 
Numerous reports also indicate that patients suspected or even confirmed cases were escaping from health facilities to 
continue supporting their family with income generated on a daily basis. Between hunger and infection, impoverished 
communities will tend to prioritize surviving strategies based on income rather than health protection.  
 
In a fragile context like Afghanistan, the pandemic may have a significant and widespread humanitarian impact on the 
poorest of the poor, especially in urban and remote areas and IDP sites. It will also affect the whole population and 
further weaken coping mechanisms and social safety nets while unemployment is expected to rise from 40 per cent to 
70 per cent as a direct consequence of the pandemic (Afghan Ministry of Finance). 
 
Key concerns and aggravating factors 
 
Cross-border concerns 

•  As  of  20  April,  there  were  more  than  82,000  confirmed  cases  in  Iran  where  the  first  imported  cases  in 
Afghanistan were originated from. More than 150,000 Afghan migrants (and refugees) living in Iran returned 
crossed the border to Afghanistan between 1 and 28 March (IOM). The total number of Afghan migrants (and 
refugees) returning is estimated to 215,000 people. Although significantly reduced since 21 March, the returns 
still  continue  despite  lockdown  measures  while  all  flights  to  and  from  Iran  were  suspended.  This  influx  is 

 

3 While there are challenges in going beyond Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) and the distribution of NFIs and emergency shelters at this time, 
there is a plan to partially address these through disaster readiness proposals currently being reviewed.

considered having been the highway of the virus across the country and the porosity of the border between Iran 
and Afghanistan remains a high concern. 
In Pakistan, where 8,418 cases were confirmed as of 10 April, the country’s border with Afghanistan has been 
officially closed. Despite several brief openings during which a limited number of commercial trucks have been 
allowed to cross to ensure continued supplies of goods, the humanitarian community has expressed concerns 
about  the  impact  of  repeated  border  interruptions  on  supplies  of  commercial  goods  which  could  drive  up 
domestic prices in Afghanistan, as well as the impact on pipelines for humanitarian goods (i.e. food supplies). 
There are nearly 3 million documented and undocumented Afghan refugees living in Pakistan. The country’s 
Torkham  and  Chaman-Spin  Boldak  border  crossings  with  Afghanistan  were  re-opened  on  6  April  to  allow 
citizens of Afghanistan who have been stuck in Pakistan to return. More than 70,000 people travelled across 
the borders from 6 to 10 April, which caused overwhelming COVID-19 screening measures according to IOM. 
Initially people returning to Afghanistan were likely to be placed under quarantine immediately after crossing at 
Torkham, irrespective of whether they had any symptoms. However, local authorities later changed their position 
due to the volume of the cross-border movement and instructed people to self-quarantine in their respective 
homes (OCHA/IOM). 
In  early  March,  Afghanistan’s  neighbors  –  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan  and  Uzbekistan  –  have  closed  their 
borders for civilian movement and suspended flights to and from Afghanistan. However, several commercial 
transports are still in service. 

 
Insecurity and violence  

•  Despite progress of the peace talks with the signing of a peace agreement between the US and the Taliban at 
the end of February followed by initial intra-Afghan discussion on prisoners, violence and insecurity remain a 
daily reality in the country. In March, the number of attacks has significantly increased, mostly targeting Afghan 
National Security Forces but also affecting civilians. In this context, and despite the pandemics, the risk of a 
‘Spring offensive’ is not excluded. 

•  The level of criminality is also expected to rise while security forces focus on COVID-19 related measures and 

potentially fed by the worsening of socio-economic conditions and access to affordable food. 

•  With the further enforcement of lockdown measures, concerns are also growing with regards to heightened risk 

of sexual and gender-based violence against women and children (SGBV) and the rise of protection needs. 

 
Disease, disaster, displacement: combined risks of cumulated shocks 

•  Disease: As observed in other countries, COVID-19 will have an impact on the capacity to address existing 
health  challenges,  including  non-communicable  diseases  or  mother-and-child  health.  Owing  to  weak  health 
systems  and  infrastructures,  it  is  expected  that  health  facilities  will  be  overwhelmed  by  the  priority  given  on 
people  affected  by  the  pandemic  to  the  expense  of  people  suffering  from  chronic  and  other  communicable 
diseases.  Among  vaccine  preventable  diseases,  polio  is  not  yet  eradicated  in  the  country,  measles  and 
whooping  cough  outbreak  are  still  prevalent  in  different  areas  and  there  are  cases  of  hepatitis  A  especially 
among children. Currently, main challenges with regards to vaccine preventable diseases in Afghanistan are: 

o  Poor utilization of immunization services due to low coverage of basic health care implementer. 
o  Disparity  in  distribution  of  healthcare  services  between  rural  and  urban  areas;  health  services  are 

unavailable in many areas. 

o  Ongoing security issues limiting access to health services. 
o  Overall systemic weaknesses of the health system (human and technical resources, infrastructures and 

etc.) after 40 years of war. 

•  Disasters: Severe rainfall have been experienced across many provinces in March and April, with an estimated 
caseload  of  more  than  34,000  people  affected  by  floods,  landslides  and  avalanches.  Preliminary  analysis 
suggests  that  nearly  60,000  hectares  of  cropland  would  be  at  risk  of  flooding  across  10  provinces.  This 
represents approximately 7 per cent of overall cropland across these provinces (Food Security Cluster). Efforts 
to contain and control the pandemics will have to be coupled with preparedness for disaster response and risk 
reduction. 

•  Displacement: In addition to Afghan returnees from Iran (215,000) and Pakistan (65,000), there are around 
55,700 people have been displaced by conflicts in first quarter of 2020 according to OCHA. Internally displaced 
people (IDP) sites in various parts of the country are also bound to be potential pandemic hotspots due to limited 
capacities to contain the propagation. 

 
Summary of the current response 
 
Afghanistan has been in a state of protracted crises and political instability for more than 40 years while the country is 
exposed  to  recurring  natural  disasters,  diseases,  displacements,  and  disruption  of  livelihood  due  to  overall  high 
vulnerability  and  reduced  coping  mechanisms.  Poor  access  to  health  care,  limited  access  to  water  and  sanitation, 
widespread food  insecurity and high rates of  malnutrition  are all  additional complicating  factors for Afghanistan. The 

 

P a g e  | 5 

 
ongoing  propagation  of  COVID-19  is  threatening  to  have  overwhelming  consequences  on  a  fragile  context  like 
Afghanistan. Recognizing the rapid propagation of the virus as well as the limited capacities of the health system to 
respond,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  enhance  multi-sectoral  preparedness,  operational  readiness  and  response 
capacities to prevent and rapidly respond to pandemic, in line with International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), while 
addressing its humanitarian consequences.  
 
Official data shows that, as of 20 April, 996 people across 30 provinces were confirmed to have the virus (for 6,422 tests 
conducted to date) and 15 people have died. Importantly, more people have now acquired the virus inside Afghanistan 
than have brought it from other affected countries.  
 
Afghan public authorities 
Aware  of  facing  a  crisis  of  potential  nation-wide  disastrous  proportions,  an  Afghan  High-Level  Committee  has  been 
established directly under the Afghan President, with a pivotal role given to the Afghan Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) 
in driving the preparedness and response process.  
 
Following initial measures in February focusing on risk communication and preparedness for response, the MoPH has 
equipped itself with an Emergency Response Plan for Corona Virus 2020 which focus on six objectives across short 
and medium terms: 

•  Early  case  finding  through  active  surveillance,  which  includes  strict  screening  at  the  points  of  entry,  referral 

system, contact tracing and community surveillance. 

•  Early isolation of confirmed cases and effective management of infected persons, with a focus on hospitalizing 
only those patients with severe symptoms (20 per cent of all cases) and those with critical conditions (5 per cent 
of cases) by increasing the number of beds from 10,400 to 40,000. 
Infection  prevention  and  control  as  vital  measures  for  controlling  the  pandemic  in  health  facilities  and 
communities. 

• 

•  Health  education,  community  mobilization,  awareness  raising  and  risk  communication  to  enhance  public 
awareness by disseminating a package of key messages and communication materials regarding COVID-19 
using different communication channels 4. 

•  Effective coordination and resource mobilization. 
•  Effective and timely logistics support for emergency response.  

 
At  the  end  of  March,  the  budget  projections  only  for  health,  has  been  increased  from  USD  123  million  for  a  low-
transmission scenario to USD 891 million for high-transmission scenario. 
 
Afghanistan relies heavily on imports for medical materials and equipment and foreign support at large. Stronger 
capacities have been built over the years with a network of 3,500 public health facilities and 1,000 private hospitals and 
clinics, 30,000 publicly employed health and around 30,000 community health volunteers, The surveillance system has 
530 sentinel sites in all the 34 provinces, in both public and private health facilities. In response to the COVID-19, active 
surveillance  sites  have  been  established  in  all  airports  and  zero-point  borders  of  the  country  with  trained  staff  and 
screening equipment. 
 
The health system would however need to be actively strengthened to enable the public authorities to detect, test, treat 
and trace in a systematic manner. In March, only one central health laboratory was doing diagnostic tests, with maximum 
capacity of 50 tests per day, costing USD 1,600 per diagnostic kit. The absence of local laboratories to do diagnostic 
tests  for  COVID-19  created  considerable  delays  in  treating  and  isolating  patients  in  hospitals  in  distant  parts  of  the 
country. The government announced in early April that around 50,000 tests to be made available and efforts to scale-
up testing were underway with additional eight testing facilities (Kabul, Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kandahar, Kapisa and 
Nangarhar provinces). Altogether, the government plans to expand to 15 testing facilities across the country within the 
month. 
 
Several provinces have instituted measures to limit the exposure of residents to COVID-19. International airports have 
been closed since end of March for commercial flights. Early April, lockdown measures were being enforced in the 
main cities (Kabul, Herat, Mazar, Kandahar, Jalalabad) where stricter measures have been progressively put in place, 
including  through  the  mobilization  of  military  and  police  forces  and  reported  arrests,  fines  and/or  placement  into 
quarantine for people who did not comply. Movement restrictions should however not affect essential public services 
nor humanitarian organizations.  
 
 
 

 

4 ARCS will look into ensuring that all risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) activities are adapted and accessible to all people, 
especially marginalized groups.

Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) 
As  auxiliary  to  public  authorities,  ARCS  leadership  has  been  involved  from  the  onset  into  the  high-level  committee 
established under the President of the country, as well as through the Emergency Committee under the MoPH while 
participating to the Health cluster meetings focused on COVID-19.  
 
In February-April, ARCS teams have been mobilized in various fronts to support prevention and containment activities, 
especially  in  Herat  and  the  overall  western  region  sharing  a  border  with  Iran.  In  support  to  early  detection  and 
surveillance  efforts,  ARCS  has  contributed  to  the  screening  of  returnees  from  China  and,  more  crucially,  from  Iran. 
During the first phase of COVID-19 preparedness and response (February-March), ARCS contributed as follows: 

•  Awareness raising on COVID-19 as part of preventive measures for ARCS own staff in all seven regional offices 
and 34 branches as well as through widespread network of health facilities (hospitals, clinics, Mobile Health 
Teams, etc.).  

•  ARCS MHT and health centers conducted awareness raising sessions /risk communication in 31 provinces.  
•  12  MHT  members,  trained  in  IPC,  engaged  in  early  detection  and  surveillance  efforts  –  more  than  142,000 
people  screened  (as  of  20  April)  for  more  than  93  presumptive  cases  identified  and  referred  to  dedicated 
governmental health facilities.   

•  At the community level, ARCS CBHFA volunteers have conducted awareness raising and risk communication 
regarding COVID-19 in 31 provinces – 470,000 people (287,000 males; 183,000 females) reached by 4,066 
volunteers (3,388 males; 678 females), where more than 200,000 printed IEC materials have been distributed 
to targeted communities.  

•  ARCS has provided 184 family tents and tarpaulins for temporary screening and shelters in the cross border 

between Afghanistan and Pakistan (Torkham, Spin – Boldak and Zherai district of Kandahar Province).  

 
ARCS priorities in responding to the pandemics 

1.  Duty of Care: To mobilize collective efforts in tackling the pandemics but also focusing on the safety of ARCS 
personnel and volunteers. As of 10 April: Measures have been taken to reduce the presence in ARCS offices 
(HQ and branch) to essential staff while Infection prevention and control routine activities are being carried out. 
There is still a crucial need of personal protection materials required. 

2.  Health in emergencies: For the emergency phase, ARCS Domestic Response Plan in health, aligned to MoPH 

emergency plan, is meant to mobilize all ARCS capacities in health including: 

Number of staff 

Number of volunteers 

Health services managed by 
ARCS 

736 medical, 45 administrative and 150 supportive staffs 
3,400 CBHFA and 3,000 Youth Volunteers5  

1 comprehensive health clinic, 45 basic health clinics (BHC), 22 health sub 
centers (HSC), 39 mobile health clinics, 31 Mobile health teams (immunization), 
1 district hospital (Kabul), 2 ambulances 

 
Upon the request of the MoPH and highest level of Afghan authorities, ARCS developed a comprehensive 
Emergency  Response  plan  which  was  submitted  to  and  approved  by  Afghan  MoPH.  Aligned  with  MoPH 
emergency  plan,  ARCS  contribution  aims  at  mobilizing  ARCS  138  health  facilities  as  well  as  community 
volunteers to support detection, surveillance, infection prevention and control activities and continued efforts in 
awareness raising and risk communication. One of the priorities for ARCS is to transform their central hospital 
in  Kabul  into  a  COVID-19  isolation  centre  (50  beds)  which  requires  urgent  procurement  of  equipment  and 
medical materials. In March, only one hospital was officially assigned to treat COVID-19 patients with a capacity 
of 100 beds for a population of 6 million people in Kabul.  

3.  Livelihoods support: Increasing mobilization will also be required to address the humanitarian consequences 

of COVID-19 with a focus on livelihoods support (food and unconditional cash transfers). 

 
Key challenges  

•  ARCS  nation-wide  engagement  has  been  impeded  and  limited  by  the  lack  of  personnel  protection 
equipment (PPEs) and medical material. This shortage has been a huge challenge for Afghan authorities as 
well as international organizations operating in the country. 
In the face of a pandemic that has become global, resources (financial, skills, infrastructures) are also missing 
in the country to rapidly and effectively bring response capacities at scale. 

• 

•  Combining  duty  of  care  and  operational  effectiveness  to  respond  to  this  emergency  will  remain  a 
constant challenge that will requires constant focus and evaluation. As of 10 April, ARCS had one confirmed 
case of COVID-19 and confirmed the loss of one associated member to ARCS mobile health team in Balkh.

Overview of Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement actions 
IFRC has been supporting ARCS from the onset at country and regional levels through targeted inputs including: 

•  Technical support in producing ARCS emergency response plan. 
• 
• 

Joint participation to the Health Cluster meetings co-led by MoPH Vice-Minister and WHO. 
Initial financial support under the DREF for immediate action focused on procurement of medical items and 
printing of IEC materials in support of prevention and preparedness efforts across ARCS offices, facilities and 
volunteers and as contribution to MoPH emergency plan.  

•  Provision of guidance materials produced at global or regional level to enhance ARCS readiness and technical 

•  Support to procurement and resource mobilization. 
•  Facilitation of Movement operational coordination and coordination with external actors, including through UN 

support for response. 

clusters. 

•  Development of IFRC Domestic Response Plan for ARCS emergency operations. 
•  Support to ARCS business continuity plan in collaboration with Movement partners. 

 
ICRC has revised its activities to include COVID-19 preparedness and response with preliminary overview of the costing 
amounting  CHF  11,200,000.  Ongoing  activities  will  continue  through  its  structure  of  10  offices  and  7  physical 
rehabilitation centres. In support of patients and health care staff, the ICRC continues to work with Kandahar Mirwais 
hospital to develop a preparedness plan in case of an outbreak. Hygiene material and personal protective equipment 
(PPE) have been provided. Additional materials have been provided to MoPH identified structures that will be tasked 
with COVID 19 case management, when available, including in the areas which are under the control of non-state armed 
groups. For the detainees and detentions facilities, the ICRC has scaled up its support to authorities including donation 
of more quantities of hygiene material and PPE to their staff.  Support will be provided to the Afghan Red Crescent to 
ensure  protection  of  staff  and  volunteers  while  performing  their  Human  Remains  Transfer  Program  (including  dead 
bodies due to COVID 19) and also restoring family links within the normal ongoing activities. The ICRC keeps close 
coordination  with  Movement  partners  to  support  the  ARCS  emergency  response  plan  with  specific  focus  on  hard  to 
reach areas. The support is focused on the 140 health structures to continue normal activities and respond to COVID 
19 needs. The ICRC continues to provide major part of the ARCS Logistic supply chain for these health structures in 
collaboration with Norwegian Red Cross including supplies for PPE and medical items.    
 
Norwegian Red Cross and Canadian Red Cross have made financial contribution to support ARCS prevention and 
preparedness activities while China Red Cross have expressed intention to enhance their support as well. Turkish RC 
announced its bilateral support of USD 10,000 with in-kind support of 300 hygiene kits. QRCS supported the NS with 
CHF 3,000 for PPEs and announced its CHF 15,000 more support to ARCS. 
 
Movement coordination and cooperation 

•  A COVID-19 task force has been established, led by ARCS leadership and health team, convening on a weekly 

• 

basis together with Movement partners.  
In  rising  to  the  challenge  posed  by  the  pandemic,  Movement  partners  are  committed  to  work  together  in 
providing technical support by leveraging synergies and expertise. A Movement Emergency Support Group 
had to be formally established early April along the following distribution of roles:

Overview of non-Red Cross and Red Crescent actors in country 
 
Afghan Public Authorities 
National Disaster Commission (NDC) is established is established in case of huge outbreak of diseases to coordinate 
multisectoral efforts with a view to mitigate and control the outbreak. The President of the country appointed one Vice-
President to lead COVID-19 response efforts through the NDC which has been meeting several times a week. ARCS is 
a member of this Commission. The NDC has also established provincial disaster commissions. 
 
The  Emergency  Inter-sectoral  Committee  was  established  by  the  decree  of  the  President  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of 
Afghanistan  and  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Public  Health,  it  includes  key  Ministries  (Foreign  Affairs,  Haj  and  Awqaf, 
Transport,  Aviation,  Information  and  Culture,  Trade,  Agriculture  and  Livestock,  Rural  Development)  the  security 
agencies and the ARCS are member of this Committee. 
 
MoPH Emergency Committee (national and provincial) is the leading committee within MoPH responsible for ensuring 
effective and efficient coordinated response by the health sector to any disaster in the country. MoPH operational arms 
are  comprised  of  the  Department  of  Emergency  preparedness  and  Response  (EPR)  and  Centre  for  Command  and 
Control  (CCC),  a  structure  which  is  under  the  direct  supervision  of  MOPH  leadership.  Provincial  health  emergency 
committees  have  been  established  to  ensure  provincial  coordination  of  surveillance,  health  care  services  and  risk 
communication in liaison with the central committee. The provincial health directorate acts as the secretariat. 
 
Basic  Package  of  Health  Services  (BPHS)  implementers,  comprised  of  both  local  and  international  NGOs,  are 
supporting  MoPH  in  undertaking  daily surveillance of  COVID-19  in  all  Health  facilities  and  carrying  out  preventive 
measures, especially awareness raising for communities.  
 
United Nations Response and Coordination 
Afghan  public  authorities  are  also  supported  by  UN  agencies.  WHO  has  been  active  in  supporting  the  MoPH  plan, 
COVID-19 related guidelines, health capacity strengthening (including testing capacities) and the mobilization of ‘polio- 
eradication’ volunteers. IOM has been involved in border crossing site to support the crossing of returnees. 
 
A  COVID-19  Multi-Sector  Humanitarian  Country  Plan  for  Afghanistan,  coordinated  by  OCHA,  has  been  finalized 
requiring USD 108.1 million to reach 6.1 million people with life-saving assistance across all clusters. The plan outlines 
initial  preparedness  and  response  efforts  for  the  next  three  months  but  is  expected  to  be  updated  as  the  situation 
changes. This cost plan will form the basis of a Humanitarian Response Plan revision in the near future. The multisector 
plan also aims to highlight the potential effects of the outbreak on ongoing humanitarian response and spell out mitigation 
measures  being  employed  to  reduce  interruptions  to  life-saving  services.  Priority  activities  in  the  plan  include  the 
strengthening of health capacities in expanding preparedness, containment and mitigation activities, the scaling-up of 
WASH especially in IDP sites, risk communication and awareness raising, food security and malnutrition, population 
movement monitoring, support to people with specific needs as well as advocacy and flight services (including an going 
initiative to establish an international air-bridge. Meanwhile, on 2 April, the World Bank approved a US$100 million grant 
to  support  Afghanistan  to  slow  and  limit  the  spread  of  COVID-19  through  enhanced  detection,  surveillance,  and 
laboratory systems, as well as strengthening essential health care delivery and intensive care. 
 
In term of Inter-agency coordination, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) is the main inter-agency coordination body 
in liaison with the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group. 
 
ARCS and IFRC have consistently engaged in critical inter-agency coordination mechanisms including: 

•  The inter-cluster coordination group – IFRC. 
•  Health cluster (co-led by MoPH and WHO). 
•  Food security and Agriculture cluster. 
•  Protection cluster. 
•  Cash and voucher working group. 
•  Risk communication working group. 

 
Needs analysis, targeting, scenario planning and risk assessment  
 
Needs analysis 
Health:  ARCS  has  carried  out  a  baseline  assessment  to  identify  the  risks  and  challenges  associated  to  COVID 
outbreak which are to be addressed in its health emergency response plan’s implementation. These risks or challenges 
are summarized as follows: 

•  Protection  and  safety  of  frontline  responders:  The  accelerating  transmission  of  the  virus  makes  frontline 
responders  highly  exposed  to  infection,  especially  for  health  personnel  in  Kabul  and  Herat  where  infection 

 
 

 

P a g e  | 9 

 

 
 

cases have already been confirmed. The risk is heightened by the shortage or lack of protective equipment for 
health responders. 

•  Volatile and fragile security situation, 
•  Food insecurity and poor immunity of mothers, children and elderly. 
• 

Inadequate capacities or potential; capability deficit in terms of adequate Human Resources and availability of 
Medical and Non-medical Resources in the country's health clinics.  

•  Lack of comprehensive assessment report to provide needed supply for health interventions.  
•  Budget limitation for the response.  

 
Hard-to-reach  areas  /  White  zones:  Due  to  the  current  conflict  and  insecurity,  part  of  country  is  out  of  control  of 
Afghanistan  government.  Through  its  principled  humanitarian  action,  ARCS  is  in  capacity  to  ensure  access  and 
acceptance in all part of the countries, including hard-to-reach areas, to carry out critical activities including awareness 
raising,  risk  communication  and  referral  of  suspected  cases  to  dedicated  health  facilities.  MoPH  also  delegates  the 
provision of primary health services to the community through BPHS (Basic Package of Health Services) through NGOs 
which are not always in capacity to fill in gaps in ‘white areas’ where health services are missing. As per its MoU with 
the MoPH, ARCS is one or the rare organizations able to operate in white zones and hard-to reach areas across the 
whole country, through a  pool  of trained volunteers, MHTs, fixed clinics and  one district hospital  at the capital level. 
ARCS provided free health services to vulnerable people who cannot afford to pay for it building on the deployment of 
MHTs covering almost the full country. 
 

Critical needs in health 

• 

• 

• 

• 
• 

Critical stocks of PPEs, such as masks and gowns, to equip first responders as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-
19 in Afghanistan rises. 
Medicines and medical equipment for isolation centers (including ARCS hospital in Kabul), transit facilities and health 
mobile capacities (including ARCS two ambulances). 
Training materials for ARCS health responder (clinics, MHTs and volunteers) for using PPEs, infection and prevention 
control, identification of presumptive cases and referral to the dedicated hospitals in the country. 
Non-medical equipment to support detection efforts (rub halls, etc.)  
Awareness  raising  and  prevention  materials  including  speakers,  IECs,  etc.  for  community  engagement  and  risk 
communication. 

 
Food and livelihoods support: During COVID-19 pandemic is not a threat that stands separate from the sectors i.e. 
health, WASH, family wellbeing, means of income and their livelihoods. This pandemic may have severe impact on each 
pillar  of  food  security,  that  need  to  be  examined  the  protection  of  food  security  which  must  be  integrated  into  other 
sectors  in  the  COVID1-19  emergency  operation.  In  the  context  of  the  COVID-19  outbreak,  country  may  suffer  from 
various  market  disruptions,  producers,  suppliers  and  financial  service  providers,  and  retailers  can  be  affected  by 
movement restrictions and fluctuations in the availability and prices of various goods, while concerns by the general 
public  may  cause  a  spike  in  demand  for  basic  items  –  stockpiling.  This  is  particularly  likely  to  occur  following  the 
confirmation of new imported cases and/or human-to-human transmission in the country. If the situation worsens, there 
might be broader impacts on livelihoods due to border closures, restrictions of movement and economic slowdown. As 
a consequence, both markets and the food security of the most vulnerable populations should be monitored. Market 
indicators should be closely monitored to anticipate disruptions and contingency plans should be developed for the most 
likely scenarios (e.g. market assessments, assessment of key supply chains, alternative strategies for procurement and 
logistics  of  food  and  non-food  items  for  ARCS.  A  wide  range  of  actions  can  support  and  protect  food  security  in  a 
pandemic. COVID-19 response depends on early planning, that is why preparedness is so important. After considering 
the serious impact of outbreak, the NS leadership determined that food assistance is a suitable option for the operation.  
 
Cash assistance: Those financially poor populations who are either affected and quarantined or who have lost their 
income due to the COVID-19 will also be required immediate financial supports to cope with the situation.  
 

Critical needs in livelihood support 

• 

As part of the broader COVID-19 response, and considering the fact that this pandemic is having radical negative impact 
on the livelihoods and financial resilience of the poor and most vulnerable population, critical needs include 

o  Food assistance (food baskets) to poor, in urban and rural areas, including quarantined households,  
o  Multi-purpose cash assistance to the poor households that are either quarantined or have lost their incomes 

due to the COVID-19 

 
Targeting 
 
Health interventions will be carried out through ARCS 46 basic health centres, 63 Mobile Health teams and 10 Health 
Sub-Centres. The main targeting populations will be the health facilities catchment area population which have already 
set up per health facility. If we consider the average population of each health facility, 4,000 people will be covered per 
each which indicates a total of 400,000 population while such a figure will be a higher for the central hospital that maybe 

 

 
within 60,000-120,000 total population. Fixed clinics are functional in 34 provinces including the capital. They have own 
catchment population which has been already coded by the Ministry of Public Health GIS system. It's worth mentionable 
at the moment; ARCS will focus mainly on the provinces that are most vulnerable and prone to COVID-19 outbreak and 
bordering  neighbouring  countries  such  as  Iran  and  Pakistan.  According  to  statistic  report  from  the  World  Health 
Organization,  the  highest  attention  will  be  on  provinces  such  as:  Kabul,  Herat,  Farah,  Nimroz,  Kandahar,  Helmand, 
Balkh, Samangan and other provinces where suspected cases are recorded.

Rationale  
In routine basis ARCS clinics have to provide primary health care services to the targeted 
population while in the emergency situation the loading of work and services will be high and 
require  more  specific  intervention in  accordance  with  the  need  for  outbreak  management. 
Ensure  frontline  medical  personnel  are gender-balanced  and  health facilities  are culturally 
and gender sensitive. 
In the remote areas of the country, access and insecurity are the main challenges against the 
health service quality and equity. Meanwhile, Cultural factors may restrict women’s access to 
information on outbreaks and availability of health services: gender roles may dictate women 
cannot  obtain  health  services  independently  or  from  male  service  providers  -  even  in  an 
emergency.  So,  it  will  be  considered  to  provide  house  to  house  care  in  these  kinds  of 
communities. 
Established  camp  settlements  for  IDPs  and  returning  migrants/refugees  in  Herat  and 
Nangarhar  province  will  be 
returning 
migrants/refugees in Nimroz and Herat as well as other at-risk provinces. 
The  financially  poor  quarantined  households,  in  addition  to  health  care  supports,  will  also 
require immediate food and livelihoods supports as a result of having no more incomes. 
The poor and economically vulnerable households – that are not quarantined but have lost 
their incomes due to the greater result of COVID-19 – must also receive immediate relief and 
humanitarian supports, so that they should cope with the situation as well as the risk of greater 
humanitarian disasters be reduced.

In support to ARCS case management activities (COVID-19 hospital/isolation Center in Kabul), target group will also 
include people infected and hospitalized (50 beds). 
 
Scenario planning  
 

Scenario 

A small number of imported and isolated cases, managed effectively by the health system. 

Long-term spread of  the  virus,  with outbreaks  in  certain  parts  of  the  community, putting stress  on the health 
system. 

Medium 

Rapid spread of the virus, leading to breakdown of the health system and other essential services. 

High 

 
Currently  Afghanistan  is  in  “Long-term  spread  of  the  virus,  with  outbreaks  in  certain  parts  of  the  community,  putting 
stress on the health system.” scenario:  
 
MHTs  and  fixed  clinics  are  now  facing  the  cases  almost  everywhere  and  doing  case  identification  and  referrals  to 
dedicated governmental hospitals. At the same time in continuation of health promotion, risk communication for COVID-
19 is part of awareness raising activities through health facilities.

P a g e  | 11 

 
The  necessary  scaling-up  of  the  response  under  this  Domestic  Response  Plan  is  based  on  MoPH  projection  for  a 
moderate-transmission scenario that foresees: Total cases 190,549; the peak [estimated at] 31,446 cases detected 
in one week; total fatality with a 3 per cent of Case Fatality Rate, will be 5,716 persons, and 38,205 persons will need 
hospitalization;  during the  peak two weeks 6,291 cases will need hospitalization at the same time  from which 1,574 
cases (5 per cent of total cases) will be in critical phase – need ventilators. It is also taking into account the humanitarian 
impact of the pandemic and the longer term needs to be addressed. 
 
However, in case of worst-case scenario (high transmission, see above), which would have consequences of disastrous 
proportions in a fragile context like Afghanistan, this plan would need to be reviewed and expanded.

The planned coverage areas are large and security situation need to be carefully monitored. This will be factored into 
the detailed planning and budgeting for the operation and will include security and safety considerations, especially for 
frontline responders (staff and volunteers) to be provided with protective equipment and additional trainings in liaison 
with MoPH. 
 
 
B. Operational strategy 
 
The overall operational objective is to contribute to reducing morbidity, mortality as well as the humanitarian 
impact of the pandemic, in urban and rural areas, by preventing or slowing transmission and helping affected 
communities to access basic social services enabling them to cope with the situation in a dignified way.  
 
The  ARCS  deliver  humanitarian  services  across  Afghanistan  through  its  branch  network  including  the  provision  of 
community  and  primary health care services through  CBHFA volunteers, Mobile Health  teams, Health  Sub Centres, 
Basic Health Centres, Comprehensive Health clinics and a district Hospital. The ARCS is uniquely placed to provide 
essential  services  in  hard  to  reach  areas  where  ongoing  hostilities  have  resulted  in  increased  vulnerabilities  of 
communities living in these areas. The operational strategy under IFRC emergency appeal focuses on ARCS health 
facilities and livelihood support to affected households and communities. Across the response continuum, priority will 
be given to staff and volunteers’ duty of care and protection, gender and inclusion at large.  
 
Strengthening ARCS coordination with public health authorities and other stakeholders in emergency health will facilitate 
building  synergies  while  avoiding  duplication  of  efforts  resulting  in  an  effective  national  and  sub-national  response 
capacity.  
 
Protection concerns are exacerbated by pre-existing conflicts. Considering this volatile security environment, it is vital 
that  ARCS  take  preventative  measures  in  its  awareness  raising  and  mobilization  of  communities.  These  include 
implementing  IFRC  Minimum  Standard  Commitments  on  Protection,  Gender  and  Inclusion  during  Emergencies. 
Specifically, these minimum standards should be  utilized during assessments of the ARCS response. The  response 
should  include  a  gender  and  diversity  analysis  in  all  actions  and  adapt  activities  as  required  to  ensure  to  ensure 
protection and inclusion for all. 
 
Proposed strategy 
 
The proposed strategy for this Domestic Response Plan will seek to reduce the vulnerability of 2,687,500 people. The 
operational strategy is articulated around four pillars: 
 

1.  Duty of care for 1,000 staff and 4,000 volunteers during the emergency response 

COVID 19 transmission is expected to significantly increase over the coming weeks exposing the frontline health 
care workers and volunteers to high risk of infection and heavy workloads. Priority will be given to the safety 
and  protection  the  frontline  workers  (staff  and  volunteers  involved  in  the  response)  who  are  critical  in  the 
containment of the pandemic.  

•  Provision of Personnel Protective Equipment (PPEs) for frontline staff in ARCS health facilities, including 
in the district hospital in Kabul to be turned into a COVID-19 isolation centre (around 1,000 staff) as well 
as volunteers engaged in community engagement and risk communication (4,000 volunteers). This is a 
condition for ARCS teams to operate within minimum safety conditions. 

•  The provision of 220,000 hygienic items – sanitizers, hand washing soap, disinfectant, etc. 
•  Health risk allowance for staff involved in the response (clinics, MHTs, immunization teams, hospital). 
• 

Insurance for 4,000 volunteers. 

2.  Health in emergencies 

IFRC  Domestic  Response  Plan  for  Afghanistan  will  support  ARCS  health  emergency  plan  that  has  been 
approved  by  Afghan  MoPH.  Coordinated  technical  support  with  RCRC  movement  partners    -  including  with 
{Norwegian  Red  Cross  (emergency  health),  Canadian  Red  Cross  (Mobile  Health  teams)  and  ICRC  (case 
management) -  will harness the technical support capacity that can be mobilized in the country in implementing 
the Domestic Response Plan. 

 

P a g e  | 13 

•  Support  to  establishing  ARCS  district  hospital  as  COVID-19  isolation  centre  (50  beds)  in  Kabul  in  the 

• 

current District Hospital. 
Infection, prevention and control (IPC) in health facilities and communities, including in white zones and 
hard-to-reach areas. 

•  Surveillance and detection: Early case finding through screening, referral, contact tracing (when possible) 

and community surveillance, including establishment of rub hall screening centres. 

•  Community engagement, risk communication and hygiene promotion. 
•  Psychosocial support including supporting the frontline health workers and volunteers to build resilience 
and cope with the stresses of responding to the pandemic in frontlines where some of the health workers 
are casualties of the pandemic. Build the capacity of the Frontline workers on Psychosocial support for 
patients and clients who find it challenging to cope with the emotions and realities of the pandemic. 

3.  Emergency food security assistance 

ARCS  will  be  supported  in  providing  emergency  food  security  assistance  to  the  poor  and  most  vulnerable 
households (including displacement affected people) that are / will directly be affected by COVID-19 outbreak. 
The planned activities under this component will be operationalized as per the following operational strategy 
and procedures. 

•  The poor and most vulnerable households in quarantine, households with a member(s) under treatment, 

or households who have lost their main income sources will be prioritized. 

•  The poor and most vulnerable households (around 22,000) that are still having access to local markets 

will be provided with unconditional cash assistance to address their food needs. 

 
The poor and most vulnerable households that are in quarantine and cannot leave their residences to purchase 
food will be included: 

•  Food  packages  or  multipurpose  cash  assistance  to  be  provided  with  in-kind  to  most  impoverished 

communities, including in urban informal settlements and IDP and returnee sites,  

•  Food packages or multipurpose cash assistance (raw or cooked food baskets). 
•  The displacement affected households (IDPs or returnees) and households with handicapped member(s) 

in need of emergency food assistance will be amongst prioritized beneficiaries under this component. 

•  All the target households, under this component, will be eligible to receive complete food baskets for one 

month. 

 

4.  Capacities and systems strengthening 

The operational response will go together with efforts to enhance ARCS capacities and systems in a sustainable 
manner. Activities will aim at strengthening the organization effectiveness and readiness to respond in priority 
areas (health and livelihoods support) as well as existing systems. Under this priority will be included: 

•  Youth and volunteer engagement and management. 
•  Data readiness and ARCS Information management in liaison with HMIS. 
•  Support to ARCS logistical capacities (purchasing of 2 trucks and strengthened warehousing capacity). 
•  Protection, gender and inclusion. 
•  Support to ARCS Business continuity. 
•  ARCS operational frameworks and procedures for preparedness and response to pandemics. 

  
While it is anticipated that some ongoing ARCS supported programmes will be postponed or delayed, this operational 
strategy will also aim to  integrate COVID-19 response components in relevant  ongoing programmes and  operations 
while keeping aa response capacity in case of other emergencies. This will require to repurpose, partially or integrally, 
some activities in liaison and agreement with funding partners.  
 
They include but are not limited to: 

• 

Immunization programme and health teams in hard-to-reach areas and associated mobile immunization and 
health teams (31). 

•  Community-based health programme, which includes the mobilization of community health volunteers. 
•  Women empowerment programme, including through the involvement of ARCS Marastoons (social welfare 
centres hosting widows and under-privileged women) in the effort of producing locally protective equipment as 
income-generating activities.

Proposed interventions 
 
Overall, this operation seeks to assist the following within each sector:  

 

• 

•  Procurement  and  distribution  of  critical  items  which  include  Personal  Protective  Equipment  (PPE)  kits, 
medicines, medical equipment, WASH-related items, food supplies and household items (rub halls, blankets, 
etc.). These procurements will prioritize PPEs for frontline responders as well as operationalization of the ARCS 
Isolation Centre for case management. Although the market in Afghanistan make the provision of these items 
heavily dependent on external support and international procurements, all efforts will be made to source and 
procure  local  items  in  line  with  acceptable  quality  standards  in  compliance  to  the  laid  down  procurement 
procedures and guidelines. 

Infection,  prevention  and  control  (IPC)  and  triage:  IPC  is  crucial  in  containing  the  spread  of  COVID-19. 
Robust  IPC  measures  and  practices  through  development  and  operationalization  of  Standard  operating 
procedures in all the ARCS health facilities. IPC aims to stop the spread of infectious diseases to other patients 
as well as health care workers by rapid isolation of suspected cases; creation of isolation areas that  ensure 
correct  patient  flow  and  keep  suspect  patient  away  from  others  seeking  usual  care;  and  availability  of 
appropriate facilities and materials for hand washing, waste management, cleaning and disinfection as well as 
PPE  for  health  workers.  It  is  also  important  that  facilities  have  trained  staff  in  triage  and  early  detection  of 
suspected Coronavirus cases. ARCS will extend the support through existing health facilities countrywide for 
improving IPC measures and the training of health personnel in the target provinces. These activities will be 
implemented through ARCS MHTs and existing health structures focusing on IPC/triage at the facility level. With 
active  support  from  Movement  partners,  IPC  needs  will  be  assessed  and  met,  taking  into  consideration  the 
Movement capacities, geographical evolution of the pandemic as well as access constraints. With the support 
of ICRC and MoPH health staff will be trained on IPC as part of critical preventive measures in all health facilities. 
This  will  protect  health  staff  and  prevent  from  spreading  of  infection  to  the  clients  and  through  them  to  the 
community members.  

•  Surveillance and detection: Health staff and volunteers will be equipped with personal protective equipment 
and trained on case identification (line listing), diagnosis and management where appropriate, in coordination 
with MoPH. In ARCS health facilities, this will include screening, referral system and possible contact tracing. 
ARCS community volunteers (100 per province) will reinforce, the surveillance programme in target provinces. 
Joint  surveillance  trainings  would  be  supplemented  by  Red  Crescent-specific  training,  i.e.  community 
engagement and epidemic control for volunteers (ECV) for those who do not already have this training.  
 

•  Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE): Community engagement will be mainstreamed 
of pandemic preparedness and response and will be integrated across all aspects of the operations in affected 
provinces  across  the  country.  Trusted,  clear  and  effective  communication  and  engagement  approaches  are 
critical to ensure that fear, panic, and rumours do not undermine the response efforts and lead to COVID-19 
spreading even more quickly. Effective community engagement will also support the operation to gain an insight 
into the perceptions and behaviours of different groups, and to develop effective and targeted messaging. ARCS 
will  adopt  diversified  approaches  to  implement  the  operation  activities  in  targeted  areas,  including  adapting 
sensitization tools to local realities and needs, using key informants to reach people and influence their ways 
and practices. These approaches put communities at the centre of all actions through community leaders, men, 
women and youth groups. IFRC will ensure national RCCE plans are informed by gender analysis and sex, age, 
pregnancy status, and disability disaggregated data where available.  

•  Mental Health and psychosocial support: COVID-19 pandemic needs are identified in various populations 
facing  the  outbreak.  SGBV  prevalence  has  complicated  the  emergency  response  in  Afghanistan  where  the 
coping mechanisms of most individuals deficient and stressful. Frontline health workers and volunteers who are 
supporting  the  response  encounter  challenging  problems  daily  and  would  need  PSS  in  order  to  continue  to 
function optimally. In addition, SGBV increases in contexts of emergencies, with additional strain being put on 
already weak health structures in the country, a training component on responding to the mental health and 
psychosocial needs of SGBV survivors will also be integrated into the PSS pillar of the response. Alongside the 
training  of  volunteers,  the  coordination  with  other  actors  able  to  provide  services  for  survivors  will  be 
strengthened  to  ensure  the  availability  of  referral  pathways.  Volunteers  working  in  COVID-19  response  and 
especially  in  high  risk  activities  are  under  extreme  stress  and  carry  out  some  of  the  most  dangerous  tasks 
related to the outbreak. MHPSS services should be made available to them as well, including,  workshops and 
actual practice of roster and work shifts to assist volunteers and staff on stress management and peer support, 
and setting up support systems to help them deal with their situation without engaging in risk taking behaviour. 
A team of trainers in psychosocial support will be set up within ARCS and will be able to carry out awareness 
activities and trainings for both the staff and volunteers involved in pandemic response. Referral mechanisms 
should be made available in handling various mental health clinical conditions due to pre-existing and outbreak-

related disorders.  

•  Maintenance (continuance) of and access to health care services: While focusing on the response to the 
pandemics, ARCS will also aim at ensuring continuity in the delivery of primary health services in the catchment 
areas of its 138 health facilities.  

•  Hygiene  promotion:  Hygiene  promotion  begins  by 

through  appropriate 
communication  channels  and  then  focusing  on  the  most  effective  interventions,  including  handwashing  with 
soap, excreta disposal, household water treatment and safe storage. Messages will aim to address local health 
risks  and  behaviour  change  in  most  at-risk  communities.  In  this  operation  ARCS  will  support  communities 
through its trained volunteers to communicate and disseminate the information to households on WASH issues. 

identifying  key  messages 

•  Food assistance: The proper functioning of market chains and flow of agricultural products are key elements 
for food and nutrition security. The deadly COVID-19 outbreak knock-on and may have huge effects – loss of 
lives, stifled growth rates, reverse socio-economic  gains, aggravate poverty and  food insecurity  and destroy 
livelihoods and particularly affecting women and children. Beyond physical effects of the pandemic, people will 
suffer reversals in economic empowerment, because of reduction of the economic activities related to COVID-
19 control measures that restrict the movement of people and goods. In their role as economic providers for 
their families, people will experience sharper negative economic impacts. If the situation worsens, there might 
be broader impacts on livelihoods due to border closures, restrictions of movement and economic slowdown. 
Consequently,  both  markets  and  the  food  security  of  the  most  vulnerable  populations  should  be  monitored. 
Under  specific  circumstances  during  COVID-19  outbreak,  ARCS  will  provide  food  assistance  to  households 
affected by movement restrictions and loss of their livelihoods. Food assistance brings a clear contribution to 
the  disease  containment  efforts  and/or  food  security  outcomes.  ARCS  will  ensure  to  access  equally  and  to 
impartial assistance according to need and without discrimination. This includes identifying people in need of 
food  assistance  if  they  are  marginalized  or  fear  marginalization  due  to  the  virus  and  preserving  sensitive 
information on affected persons or communities. 

•  Cash and Voucher Assistance to support affected people needs and livelihoods: ARCS will be supported 
in  providing  emergency  food  assistance  to  the  poor  and  most  vulnerable  households  that  are  affected  by 
COVID-19. This will include households in quarantine, households with a member under treatment, and poor 
households that lost their main income source due to movement restrictions. Depending on the local context 
and accessibility of target households to markets, the type of food assistance will either be unconditional cash 
assistance  (cash  for  food),  or  in-kind  assistance  (raw  or  cooked  food  baskets).  As  of  development  of  this 
Domestic Response  Plan,  ARCS intend to provide unconditional cash  assistance to 22,000  households and 
food baskets to additional 50,000 households across all 34 provinces of Afghanistan. The distribution of targets 
to  provinces  will  be  finalized  at  the  start-up  phase  of  the  implementation.  All  the  households,  within  this 
component, will be eligible to receive complete food basket for one month. 
 

•  Protection, gender and inclusion: The operation will apply an integrated approach and the IFRC Minimum 
Standard  to  Protection,  Gender  and  Inclusion  in  Emergency  Programming  will  be  mainstreamed  in  sector 
specific interventions.  Briefings will be held on IFRC/ARCS commitments through the Code of Conduct and 
Child protection Policy, as well as obligations of volunteers, staff and management to ensure a zero tolerance 
to  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  (PSEA).  Community  based  protection  approaches  will  be  designed  by 
communities  and  this  will  be  enhanced  during  the  operation  to  ensure  social  inclusion  and  community 
cohesiveness, as well as to mitigate tensions. Based on the community structures in the villages, a need  to 
focus on women’s participation and decision making in the community is essential, promoting grandmothers as 
active agents in all activities including longer term social inclusion initiatives. Outreach teams and mobile health 
teams  will  be  equipped  with  referral  information  and  will  have  received  training  on  Protection,  gender  and 
inclusion to be able to support with house to house visits when difficulties in access may be increased.

management, forensic and ARCS business continuity. 

 
Surge support 
Due to the closure of airports and access to and from Kabul, surge capacities will be sourced locally, at least during the 
first phase of the response, and will include: 

•  An  operations  support  coordinator,  responsible  for  coordinating  the  emergency  response  with  a  focus  on 

monitoring, evaluation and reporting functions, in support to ARCS and in compliance with IFRC procedures.  

•  Health officer to support ARCS health-related activities with a focus on health communication. 
•  PGI officer to ensure the mainstreaming of protection and gender related activities and monitoring. 
•  A PMER senior officer. 
•  A livelihoods senior officer. 
•  Communication coordinator to support awareness raising activities, facilitate content generation and produce 

regular information materials for partners and media. 

•  Disaster risk  management  coordinator  to support ARCS  emergency readiness  and systems and prepare for 

disaster response.  

 
ARCS 

 

•  At the provincial level, the National Society will hire a project staff designated for the implementation of ARCS 
emergency  plan.  Besides  health,  livelihoods  &  cash,  and  youth  &  volunteer  focal  points,  administration  and 
finance persons will also be appointed.  

•  At the level of the implementation areas, the National Society will commit DRUs/NDRTs for operation and for 

the supervision of volunteers.  

Logistics and supply chain management 
Logistics activities aim to effectively manage the supply chain, including mobilization, procurement, customs clearance, 
fleet, storage and transport to distribution sites in accordance with the operation’s requirements and aligned to IFRC’s 
logistics standards, processes and procedures.  
 
Personal protective equipment (PPE) kit are needed for this operation. Except medicine and water filter, most of the 
relief items will be replenished subject to funding availability. PPE kits will be sourced internationally through Operational 
Logistics,  Procurement  &  Supply  Chain  Management  Unit,  Asia  Pacific  (OLPSCM).  IFRC  CO  will  source  out  some 
items/equipment  based  on  the  availability  in  Afghanistan  in  accordance  with  IFRC  procurement  procedures  and 
processes. 
 
One  surge  specialized  in  logistics  will  be  deployed  to  Kabul  in  review  the  logistics  and  procurement  processes  and 
introduce  improvements,  coach  and  train  IFRC  logistics  officer,  and,  coordinate  logistics  of  the  Emergency  Appeal 
operation.  
 
Communication strategy  
ARCS and IFRC will collaborate to implement a two-fold communication approach: 

•  Support awareness raising and risk communication strategy through the provision of communication materials, 
messages  and  recommendations  on  appropriate  communication  channels  to  ensure  wide  outreach  on 
prevention activities. 

•  Movement  and  external  communication,  in  liaison  with  and  support  to  ARCS  communication  team,  through 
context analysis, content generation, media/social media materials and outreach, potential field visits as well as 
weekly  updates  and  information  materials  on  the  emergency  response  targeting  partners  and  external 
stakeholders.  

 
Security  
Generally, the security situation in the country remains unpredictable and volatile, and in some areas the security risks 
are  extreme.  The  overall  response  in  COVID-19  outbreak  may  affect  the  activities  and  communities  due  to  access 
restriction  or  security  concerns.  Civilians  living  in  the  provinces  of  Nangarhar,  Kabul,  Helmand,  Ghazni,  and  Faryab 
were most impacted by the conflict. The increase in the number of civilian casualties from suicide and complex attacks 
by anti-government elements, more than half of which are attributed to a non-state armed group, continued to offset 
decreases  in  civilian  casualties  from  other  incidents.  The  majority  resulted  from  suicide  and  complex  attacks,  which 
increased both in frequency and in lethality to civilians, driving the overall rise in civilian deaths. Ground engagements 

 

 

 
 

P a g e  | 17 

 
were the second leading cause of civilian casualties, followed by targeted and deliberate killings, aerial operations, and 
explosive remnants of war. confinement measures initially led to a decrease in traditional criminality in many places, as 
movement restrictions and curfew made it difficult for criminals to move around. The fact that people are staying at home 
means less victims in the street and less empty houses to break into. However, in the medium term this might lead to 
an increase in crime of opportunity 
 
The IFRC Afghanistan country office will continue to provide regular analytical updates on security to inform emergency 
operations and facilitate anticipation and adaptability in planning and delivery.  
 
Planning, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting (PMER)  
Continuous monitoring will be carried out through the ARCS staff members in the areas of implementation to support 
the  COVID-19  interventions  and  will  ensure  that  there  is  compliance  with  the  minimum  international  humanitarian 
standards and IFRC Fundamental Principles, as well as beneficiary satisfaction, and the management of the available 
resources. The IFRC Afghanistan Country Office will also carry out monitoring missions in collaboration with the ARCS 
to support the effective implementation of the revised Emergency Appeal and Domestic Response Plan and budget will 
be  conducted  based  on  the  results  of  the  monitoring  report.  Trained  staff  and  volunteers  will  be  mobilized  for  data 
collection  and  basic  analysis  in  all  target  provincial  branches.  Data  collections  include  registration  of  people  to  be 
assisted,  baseline  data  on  Cash  and  Voucher  Assistance  (CVA),  post-distribution  monitoring  (PDM)  data,  end  line 
survey, market analysis and price monitoring data. Steps are being taken to strengthen the National Society approaches 
to PMER.  
 
Through this Domestic Response Plan, IFRC Afghanistan country office as part of PMER development efforts of the 
National Society will extend its PMER support, the plans will be developed with PMER unit at the National Society that 
will  be  responsible  for  implementing  a  monitoring,  evaluation  and  reporting  system.  Monitoring  and  reporting  will  be 
done according to the agreed monitoring  framework. Whereby the  provincial branch staff  and volunteers  will submit 
reports  to  respective  branch  focal  person  weekly  and  monthly.  The  branch  weekly  and  monthly  report  will  then  be 
submitted to national PMER unit for consolidation. A mid-term and an (independent) end-term evaluation will be carried 
out, mainly for impact assessment.  
 
Administration and Finance 
A Project Agreement will be signed between the IFRC Afghanistan country office and the ARCS, which will outline the 
parties’ responsibilities to implement the activities planned within the Emergency Appeal and ensure that the appropriate 
guidelines are complied with in terms of the use of the funding allocations. The ARCS have a permanent administrative 
and financial department, which will ensure the proper use of financial resources in accordance with terms of the Project 
Grant Agreement for COVID-19 Emergency Appeal. Monthly field returns will be sent to the IFRC Afghanistan county 
office  for  verification  and  booking  to  ensure  that  the  activities  are  reported  in  accordance  with  the  IFRC  Standard 
Financial Management procedures.

C. Detailed Operational Plan 
 

Livelihoods and basic needs 
People targeted: 504,000 
Male: 252,000 
Female: 252,000 
Requirements (CHF): 7,185,679 

 

 
Needs analysis: First, in general, poverty rates in Afghanistan continue to rise as a result of continued conflict, climate change, and the added challenges created by cross 
border arrivals on already stretched economies and systems. Based on the 2020 Humanitarian Needs Overview, in 2020, 8.21 million vulnerable people are in need of urgent 
food and livelihoods assistance in the country. A recent nutrition survey across Afghanistan indicated that 22 out of 34 provinces are currently above the emergency level 
threshold for acute malnutrition. 
 
The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has made the already worse situation of the country more deteriorating. The shocks and stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic is having a much 
broader impact on the socio- economic of the vulnerable households and will not only diminished the well-being and livelihoods of people, but also undermined the markets and 
food security on which life depends. In Afghanistan, the COVID-19 outbreak comes against the backdrop of the Spring flood season. Each year, floods affect large swathes of 
the country as heavy snow melts and rivers swell, inundating communities. Heavy rainfall also contributes to flash flooding. The typical flood season runs from March to June 
each year. In 2020, some 200,000 people are expected to be affected only by floods. 
  
The shocks of COVID-19 will also have impacts on labour markets, purchasing power and lost productivity – all of which are significant factors for Afghanistan, not least because 
few Afghans have access to productive or sustainable remunerative employment. A quarter of the labour force is unemployed, and 80 percent of employment is ‘vulnerable’ 
and insecure, comprising self-employment, day labour, or unpaid work. There are also growing concerns that due to price increases and future movement restrictions, farmers’ 
and  herders’  access  to  farming  inputs  may  be  hampered,  reducing  their  ability  to  successfully  grow  summer  crops  (mostly  vegetables  and  pulses),  sell  produce  and 
vaccinate/treat their livestock. 
 
It is also important to note that Afghanistan’s economy and millions of families have grown reliant on remittances from Iran. Currency devaluations over the past year have 
resulted in a drop in the value of such remittances but the surge in returns and COVID-19 interruptions to work opportunities in Iran will further diminish the purchasing power 
of many communities who have been heavily reliant on remittance payments over recent years. This will have a severe impact on vulnerable families. 
 
Within this broader context, and considering the direct impact of COVID-19 on food, nutrition, and livelihoods security of especially the poor and most vulnerable households 
(households in IPC phase 3 and 4, and IDP and returnee households both in urban and rural areas), IFRC intends to support the ARCS provide food assistance and multi-
purpose cash assistance to the households that will be quarantined, households that will be under treatments, or households that will lose their incomes due to the COVID-
19. In addition, ARCS will also be supported in recruiting the food suppliers, so that the food suppliers should supply food directly to the homes of the households that will be 
quarantined and that cannot access market to purchase food. 
 

 

 

P a g e  | 19 

 
Risk analysis: The following risks are anticipated with implementing the activities planned under the livelihoods and basic needs component of this Domestic Response 
Plan.  
 
Quarantined groups have difficulty accessing distribution site and/or local markets: the quarantined individuals and households and other vulnerable groups (persons 
with disabilities, elderly, etc.), who face problems accessing the distribution sites or local markets will receive their cash in their locations. Furthermore, the local food vendors 
willing to transport food items to local areas will also be contracted and used. 
 
Diversion of assistance to non-eligible or non-beneficiaries: IFRC will support the ARCS in conducting verification of beneficiary lists before finalization to ensure the 
households are eligible. Beneficiaries will be verified during cash distributions (i.e. ID check to verify they are the intended recipient) and ARCS will seek to ensure that there 
is a context-specific identity verification process at the distribution site. The engagement of community elders and other community-based networks will reduce the risk of fake 
beneficiary inclusion. Furthermore, IFRC will also support ARCS in establishing community-based feedback and complaint mechanism that will allow the beneficiaries and 
non-beneficiaries share their voices / feedback / complaints with ARCS. 
 
Transfer  value  is  insufficient  to  cover  food  or  other  basic  needs  due  to  market  price  fluctuations:  IFRC  will  support  ARCS  to  regularly  monitor  the  market  prices 
especially the prices of food items. In addition, close and systematic coordination with relevant clusters such as the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster and the Cash and 
Voucher Working Group will also enable IFRC and ARCS receive up to date market related information from these sources. In case of significant increase in food other basic 
need market prices, IFRC and ARCS will remain flexible in changing the transfer value. 
 
Population to be assisted: under this Emergency Appeal, IFRC and ARCS intend to provide emergency food assistance and multiple cash grants to the financially 
most vulnerable households that will lose their incomes due to being quarantined or the broader impact of the COVID-19. 
 
Programme standards/benchmarks: IFRC and ARCS, to implement the planned livelihoods and basic needs assistance activities under this Emergency Appeal, will 
consider and apply the programming standards of the relevant clusters (i.e. Afghanistan Food Security Cluster and Cash and Voucher Working Group), and the Ministry of 
Public Health of Afghanistan.

Needs analysis: The overall operational objective is to contribute to reduce the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 outbreak by preventing or slowing transmission of the 
virus across Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. Adjusted to a moderate-transmission scenario (40,000 confirmed cases), response strategies must however be adaptable to a changing 
epidemiology. Given the different challenges faced in urban and non-urban settings including access and security, the response must be continuously adapted to fit the evolution 
of the outbreak and of the new areas affected including increasing the use of mobile health teams, decentralizing and localizing response activities and use of rapid response 
teams while taking into account the psychosocial dimension on vulnerable communities.  
 
In support of ARCS priorities and commitments under the MoPH, IFRC Domestic Response Plan will focus its efforts on equipping and supporting ARCS health facilities and 
outreach in communities with a focus on: 

•  Procuring and providing protective equipment for staff and volunteers as absolute priority.  
•  Supporting the supply chain to operationalize ARCS hospital/isolation capacities for case management. 
•  Providing medical and non-medical materials to ARCS health teams (clinics, mobile teams, etc.) to support screening, contact tracing and community outreach as part 

of the nation-wide surveillance efforts.  

•  Risk communication activities to share timely and trustworthy information, address misinformation and build knowledge, acceptance and intention about signs and 

symptoms, transmission modes, preventive actions (handwashing and social distancing).  

•  Community engagement approaches with focus on targeted public engagement (through media), community feedback systems, volunteers dialogue and community 
level activities (through/ with key influencers) to address fear, enhance trust and promote community-led solutions to prevent and control the outbreak (closely linking 
health and PSSMH activities).  

•  Ensuring the mainstreaming of PGI in emergencies across health response, including for Sexual and gender-based violence prevention and child protection. 
•  Facilitating care for people who cannot access health and other essential services due to social  exclusion, other barriers to  access, or during shutdown  of public 

services, public transportation, etc.  

 
Risk analysis: In case of accelerated and uncontrolled transmission of the virus affecting frontline responders could result in proportionally reduced response capacities. The 
risk is particularly high for large populations concentrated in cities, especially in informal urban settlements without adequate water and waste management and deficiencies in 
public health infrastructures. Security risks and impeded access remain permanent as the response takes place in a protracted crisis context marked by more than 18 years of 
conflict. 
 
Population to be assisted:  

•  Preparedness and containment activities will focus on enhanced engagement of ARCS health facilities and engagement of communities at risk of transmission, in 

urban settings and hard-to-reach areas. 

•  Mitigation and risk reduction activities will be focused on ensuring the most vulnerable and excluded groups have access to essential services  
•  Priority communities across all phases of the outbreak will include:

Water, sanitation and hygiene 
People targeted: 190,000 
Male: 96,330 
Female: 93,670 
Requirements (CHF): 529,724 

 

 
Needs analysis: Community people are unaware on water purification methods for safe drinking while sanitation management systems and hygiene practices remain weak 
and sub-standard across the country, including on handwashing. Gaps in WASH need to be addressed as critical part of the emergency response to the pandemic.  
 
Risk analysis: One of the key risks of spreading of COVID-19 is due to poor hygiene especially hand washing. In Afghanistan this risk is very high due to lack of health 
knowledge, poor economic status and water supply.     
 
Population  to  be  assisted:  Preparedness  and  containment  activities  will  focus  on  hygiene  promotion  in  most  at-risk  communities,  while  building  the  capacity  and 
relationships needed for ARCS and volunteers to effectively respond. Priority communities across all phases of the outbreak will include: 

Internal Displaced Population (IDPs). 

• 
•  Refugees/ returnees. 
•  Hard-to-reach, white and insecure areas. 
•  Remote and isolated communities. 

 
Programme standards/benchmarks: The aim of WASH interventions under this sectoral component is to promote good personal and environmental hygiene as barriers 
to virus transmission. WASH activities in targeted provinces will be conducted in collaboration with MoPH and other humanitarian actors in accordance with the Sphere Standards 
as well as IFRC WASH for hygiene promotion in emergency operations and IFRC MHM guide and tools.

Protection, Gender and Inclusion 
People targeted: 150,000 
Male: 76,050 
Female: 73,950 
Requirements (CHF): 298,200 

 

 
Protection needs: This response is taking place across the country with a high rate of gender-based violence, marginalization of a number of populations and presence of 
extremely vulnerable groups. The major needs in this sector include ensuring all populations  the most vulnerable people are reached by COVID-19 response and preparedness 
activities; training of ARCS volunteers and staff on key areas including prevention and response to sexual and gender-based violence as well as protection against sexual 
exploitation and abuse. The PGI activities will be implemented for both COVID-19 response and preparedness in all provinces across the country. Vulnerable population in 
Afghanistan such as women, children, elderly, persons with disabilities and the sick are at higher risk of exploitation. There is a need to protect this population and incorporate 
their  different needs into the programming. Protection needs in the complex  emergency in Afghanistan  are mainly related to the deteriorating security situation  and forced 
population movements. Children are at particular risk of abuse, neglect, marginalization, and exploitation. Holistic approaches aimed at improving the resilience and self-reliance 
of affected households, as well as enhancing positive engagement of governance structures to reduce vulnerabilities and to mitigate short and longer-term protection risks. 
Timely identification of protection risks through systematic and coordinated protection monitoring and analysis will inform preventative, responsive, and remedial interventions, 
as well as enhance accountability. This includes evidence-based advocacy, protection specific service delivery, and community-based mobilization, mitigation, and prevention 
activities creating a protection-conducive environment.  
 
ARCS and IFRC will coordinate with protection and gender-based violence clusters in western, central, northern and eastern regions. Stronger linkages with protection clusters 
are also sought on relevant issues of common interest, such as the development of a comprehensive disability and assistance survivor support strategy and response; enhanced 
operational and planning integration of PGI across the emergency response. 
 
Risk analysis: The PGI risks are cross cutting in nature. The programme staff often overlook the softer issues in relation to inclusiveness, protection and gender sensitivity 
while undertaking community-based livelihoods activities in affected areas.  
 
Population to be assisted: All the people involved/assisted in either relief phase and through any sectoral interventions, must include PGI lenses, especially in beneficiary 
selection, delivery of interventions, monitoring and reporting. As an essential crosscutting theme for all RCRC emergency operations, the operation targets all beneficiaries with 
a PGI driven approach.  
 
Program standards/benchmarks: PGI approaches will be aligned with the IFRC Minimum Standard to Protection, Gender and Inclusion in Emergency Programming, the 
IASC Gender-Based Violence Guidelines. The IFRC  MSs  have been developed based  on  (but not  limited  to) the  Sphere handbook and  the Minimum Standards for  Child 
Protection in Humanitarian Action. The Protection, Gender and Inclusion Area of Focus of the emergency appeal is complimentary to the Response Priority 1 of the One Window 
Framework.

Strategies for Implementation 
Requirements (CHF): 4,349,305 

 
Based on the demand for the technical and coordination support required for this operation, the following programme support functions will be put in place or maintained to 
ensure an effective and efficient technical coordination: human resources, logistics and supply chain; information technology support (IT); communications; security; planning, 
monitoring, evaluation and reporting (PMER); partnerships and resource development; finance and administration; and information management (IM). A core emphasis of the 
strategy  is  to  strengthen  the  National  Society  in  the  above-mentioned  areas.  The  regional  coordination  strategy  and  plans,  in  addition  to  providing  technical  and  strategic 
guidance, further allows for the coordination and overview needed for monitoring, reviews and a final evaluation of the operation. Core assumptions, the context and impact, 
operational constraints, and priority needs continuous assessments will be carried out by the ARCS staff and volunteers as well as IFRC operational staff in the targeted area. 
 
Several related guidance and additional tools are or have been adapted, revised or updated, in particular for business continuity planning, which establishes the basis for 
National Societies to ensure the continuous functioning of key services during the crisis in all relevant locations. It includes also a plan to recover and resume business processes 
when programmes have been disrupted unexpectedly. Beside activities ensuring the duty of care for staff and volunteers, special focus is also put on back-up measures for 
defined services of the National Societies.  
 

Outcome S1.1: National Society capacity building and organizational development objectives are 
facilitated to ensure that National Societies have the necessary legal, ethical and financial foundations,

How we work  
All  IFRC  assistance  seeks  to  adhere  to  the  Code  of  Conduct  for  the  International  Red  Cross  and  Red  Crescent 
Movement  and  Non-Governmental  Organizations  (NGO’s)  in  Disaster  Relief  and  the  Humanitarian  Charter  and 
Minimum  Standards  in  Humanitarian  Response  (Sphere)  in  delivering  assistance  to  the  most  vulnerable.  The 
IFRC’s vision is to inspire, encourage, facilitate and promote at all times all forms of humanitarian activities by 
National  Societies,  with  a  view  to  preventing  and  alleviating  human  suffering,  and  thereby  contributing  to  the 
maintenance and promotion of human dignity and peace in the world.
