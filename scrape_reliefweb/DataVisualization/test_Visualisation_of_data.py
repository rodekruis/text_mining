# Since plots are hard to test automatically, we will test all the plots manually. Below you can find an overview of
# eacht manual test.

# Manual test of "affected per year":
# The production of this plot has been tested by hand through running the code for different number of affected people.
# Presetting the size of the plot was not necessary in this case as the automatically set sizes looks quite nice
# already. The filtering has been checked by simply printing the head of the produced dataframe and checking whether
# all the "keys" were actually years as pre-specified which also was the case.

# Manual test of "budget per year":
# The production of this plot has been tested by hand through running the code for different allocated budgets on
# yearly basis. Presetting the size of the plot was not necessary in this case as the automatically set sizes looks
# quite nice already. The filtering has been checked by simply printing the head of the produced dataframe and checking
# whether only disasters of the specified type were added, which also was the case. Individual prints statement were
# also specified.


# Manual test of "budget per month":
# The production of this plot has been tested by hand through running the function for different allocated budgets on
# monthly basis. Presetting the size of the plot was not necessary in this case as the automatically set sizes looks
# quite nice already. The filtering has been checked by simply printing the head of the produced dataframe and
# checking whether only disasters of the specified type were added, which also was the case. Overall the graphs did
# not show any big outliers

# Manual test of "disaster per country":
# The production of this plot has been tested by hand through running the function for different types of disasters.
# Presetting the size of the plot was not necessary in this case as the automatically set sizes looks quite nice
# already. The filtering has been checked by simply printing the head of the produced dataframe and checking whether
# only disasters of the specified type were added, which also was the case. Here however, the country could not be
# tested if it did exist as there are too many countries to check there existance however we did eyeball them.

# Manual test of "disaster per month":
# The production of this plot has been tested by hand through running the function for different types of disasters.
# Presetting the size of the plot was not necessary in this case as the automatically set sizes looks quite nice
# already. The filtering has been checked by simply printing the head of the produced dataframe and checking whether
# only disasters of the specified type were added, which also was the case.

# Manual test of "disaster per year":
# The production of this plot has been tested by hand through running the function for different types of disasters.
# Presetting the size of the plot was not necessary in this case as the automatically set sizes looks quite nice
# already. The filtering has been checked by simply printing the head of the produced dataframe and checking whether
# only disasters of the specified type were added, which also was the case.

# Manual test of "every month affected people":
# The production of this plot has been tested by hand through running the function for many disasters.
# Presetting the size of the plot was not necessary in this case as the automatically set sizes looks quite nice
# already. The filtering has been checked by simply printing the head of the produced dataframe and checking whether
# only disasters of the specified type were added, which also was the case.

# Manual test of "number of disaster types":
# The production of this plot has been tested by hand through running the function for different types of disasters.
# Presetting the size of the plot was not necessary in this case as the automatically set sizes looks quite nice
# already. The filtering has been checked by simply printing the head of the produced dataframe and checking whether
# only disasters of the specified type were added, which also was the case.

# Manual test of "total affected people by month":
# The production of this plot has been tested by hand through running the function for different types of disasters.
# Presetting the size of the plot was not necessary in this case as the automatically set sizes looks quite nice
# already. The filtering has been checked by simply printing the head of the produced dataframe and checking whether
# only disasters of the specified type were added, which also was the case.
