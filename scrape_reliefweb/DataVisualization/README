#General:

The Visualisation of data folder contains data processors that clean the dataset so as
to collect valid data and then transforms them into comprehensive summary statistics and
graphs. Moreover it also contains the created plots in .png format and the dataset used
which is stored in a csv file

#Functioning of the Folder:

The data originates form the file "data_clean.csv", this can be updated with another file,
it should however than adhere to the same formatting, then the data processors can operate
without any need of change.

The data processor all function in the same way but are fine tuned according to what
is expected from them here are the steps taken:

1) extracting, ordering cleaning
- csv file is read and transformed into a dictionary, the needed columns are taken
and the specified columns are cleaned and put into a list .If there are several lists
the lists are zipped together.

2) Processing and counting
- thereafter the list is filtered according to certain criteria (ex. digits of the month
in the date) and then put into dictionary. Data that does not have the specified format
such as is not a numerical value if it ought to be, are discarted in that process

3) Visualisation
-with the data at hand, the dictionary is transformed into a dataframe and is then either printed
as a summary statistic table or is then ploted as graph

#Testing:

Given that it is not really possible to automated test for data processing and visualisation
we were obliged to do manually testing. Tests were done by printing the resulting counter
dictionary and the intermediate variables so as to assure the right values are being processed
in the right way. Moreover, it was made sure that for every eventuality, be it missing column
or wrongly specified input the data processer would pick it up and exlude it from the counter.
This was done by precisely specifying how the format should look like before it is accepted
for processing.
