Somalia: 2 million people at risk of starvation as drought returns|07/06/2019|"



More than 2 million people could face starvation by the end of the summer, unless there are urgent efforts to respond to the drought in Somalia.

Mark Lowcock, the UN’s humanitarian chief, said the country is facing one of the driest rainy seasons in more than three decades, and a “rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation”.

By September, 2.2 million people will face hunger so severe that it threatens their lives or livelihoods. A further 3.2 million people – around one-fifth of Somalia’s population – will be uncertain of their next meal.

“If there isn’t a rapid response, there’s going to be a big problem,” said Lowcock.

Last week, the UN warned that, rather than ramping up work, agencies had been forced to cut back in some areas because the humanitarian appeal for Somalia was so poorly funded.

The crisis comes as communities struggle to recover from a two-year drought that ended in 2017."|https://tndnewsug.com/somalia-2-million-people-at-risk-of-starvation-as-drought-returns/
Thousands of households in Pader awaits hunger as drought smashes gardens|25/01/2019|"By Ojara Daniel

Over 7,000 out of the known 34,183 households as per the 2014 national housing and population census are living in fears as harsh drought paid visits to their crop gardens.

The northern Uganda district of Pader locals say they will suffer from prolong hunger after the festive season’s dryness affected their crops.

Sub-counties mostly affected by drought are preparing to face hunger are; Laguti, Acholibur, Latanya, Lapul and Pajule.

According to the report from the farmers during a training in Gulu town recently, they described the problem to the climate change.

Phillip Odong a peasant farmer in Laguti sub-county in Pader says their crops were also damaged from the gardens due to flood in between May to July last year.

Benedict Opio, another farmer from Latanya sub-county also says climate change has left their crops to dry off from the garden in late 2018.

They are now appealing to the well-wishers, NGOs and government to support them with relief food items.

Pader district has a total population of 178,004 people, as per the 2014 National Housing and Population Census.

The district authorities could not be available for comments by press time."|https://tndnewsug.com/thousands-of-households-in-pader-awaits-hunger-as-drought-smashes-gardens/
