Double curse: After drought, Kenya’s Dadaab refugee camps hit by floods|27/04/2018|"The children can’t believe their luck: storms and showers have turned their dirt football pitch into a lake. Youngsters scamper and splash through the murky water, chasing one another, leaping and laughing.

Any entertainment is welcome in Dadaab, one of the biggest refugee bases in the world. An estimated 235,000 people, most of them Somalis, live a bleak life largely defined by drought, dust and destitution.

But the children’s fun is fleeting. The seasonal rains also bring cholera and malaria, destroy rickety hand-made homes and paralyse the aid operation that is the refugees’ lifeline.

Some tracks and paths in the camps are thigh-deep in water. A woman gathers her soggy hijab about her as she wades through it. A man rolls up his trousers as high as he can but they still get wet. Progress is slow.

“We have nowhere to sleep… the water has covered everything,” said Hassan Yussuf, a 34-year-old father of five.

The earth floor of his home, built of thorny sticks and corrugated tin, is under 20 centimetres (almost eight inches) of water.

– Search for dry land –

The family has relocated to the foot of a nearby tree, their meagre belongings hung in its branches.

Inside their hut only one bed remains, above the waterline for now. On it and still dry lies Yussuf’s blind, 80-year-old mother.

“I hang out in one place or another, always looking for somewhere dry,” he said, hoping the night will not bring more floods.

“Dadaab is located on a plain where the rainwater does not drain easily, there are no drainage systems and no nearby river,” explained Caleb Odhiambo of charity Save the Children, which works in the camps. “It can be several weeks before the water returns to a normal level.”

In the meantime, pit latrines are overflowing, contaminating the water and threatening to spread disease.

Cholera is the greatest danger, especially for children who play in — and anyone who drinks — the contaminated waters.

Every year rainy-season cholera outbreaks infect many hundreds of the refugees who have fled cycles of civil war and famine in Somalia since 1991.

During the last heavy rains, in late 2015, more than a thousand people were infected and 14 of them died.

On top of that, the transformation of the camp from desert to swamp brings with it mosquitoes, and so malaria.

– Flood or drought –

“When the area is flooded, people are exposed to several diseases,” said 25-year-old Dadaab resident Mokhtar Dahari. The day before, he said, a child drowned in the rainwater nearby.

“Because of the floods, people cannot access the health centres,” Dahari said.

A driver working for a non-governmental organisation in Dadaab confirmed that some parts of the camps are “flooded and inaccessible. Humanitarian activities are slowed down.”

For now, Dahari has been spared: the floodwaters stopped a few meters (yards) from his hut. Clad in sopping jeans and clutching a shovel, he fills sandbags to barricade his home ahead of the next storm.

The rains, Dahari said, are enough to make him long for drought. “If the water rises again, the foundations of my house will be destroyed,” he said.

Odhiambo bitterly observed: “In Dadaab, you are doomed when it doesn’t rain, and doomed when it does.”"|https://nilepost.co.ug/2018/04/28/after-drought-kenyas-dadaab-refugee-camps-hit-by-floods/
Botswana drought makes wasteland of harvests, livestock|28/09/2019|"Southern Africa is experiencing one of the worst droughts in years, with more than 40 million people expected to face food insecurity because of livestock and crop losses. Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe have declared it an emergency.

In semi-arid Botswana, the farmers are reeling after the worst drought in a decade wiped out entire harvests and left the land littered with dead livestock.

Two thirds of the crops planted last season failed, while Ngamiland, a rich beef producing region, has recorded nearly 40,000 cattle deaths.

Rancher Casper Matsheka says there was no food or water, so his animals starved to death.

“The goats died, as well as the cattle, as you can see the carcasses all over. We were really affected. If only the government could subsidize the prices of feed and vaccines for the livestock during such times,” he said.

Cattle and hippos wallow in mud in one of the channels of the wildlife-rich Okavango Delta near Nxaraga village in the outskirt of Maun, Sept. 28, 2019. Botswana government declared this a drought year because of no rainfall throughout the country.

Nor has the drought sparred wildlife.

National parks authorities have resorted to feeding starving hippos while hundreds of elephants have died.

Environmental nongovernment organization, Kalahari Conservation Society’s Neil Fitt says competition for food and water has increased the risk of human-wildlife conflict.

“The livestock are now putting pressure on the wildlife areas, so the wildlife are also getting pressure on their areas, and that is where the conflict zone is,” he said. “Why I am bringing this up? The… interconnected with the drought is this wildlife-human conflict.”

In Botswana, where drought is frequent, President Mokgweetsi Masisi said the government plans to stop calling it an emergency and instead make drought relief part of the national budget.

“Government has taken a decision to develop a Drought Management Strategy, which would classify drought as a permanent feature in our budget plans, rather than an emergency,” he said. “The strategy will be completed before the end of the financial year.”

Acting director of Meteorological Services Radithupa Radithupa says a robust strategy is needed to deal with the recurring droughts.

“We are looking at climate change as an impact now, we are seeing the impact now in terms of heating, the dry spells and the excessive rains. Therefore, we really need to adapt as a nation,” Radithupa said.

Meanwhile, a forecast for rain has raised hopes among farmers and ranchers for recovery and that this season of severe drought won’t be a total loss."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2019/12/01/botswana-drought-makes-wasteland-of-harvests-livestock/
Firmino eyes end to goal drought as Liverpool face Leicester|24/04/2018|"Roberto Firmino will seek to end a rare goal drought when Liverpool take on Leicester although his manager Jurgen Klopp has no concerns about a drop-off in productivity.

The Brazil international has formed one of the most feared forward lines in European football over the past 12 months with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane.

And the 26-year-old, signed for £29 million ($38 million) from Hoffenheim three years ago, has continued his excellent form in Liverpool’s 100 percent start to the campaign — three victories and three clean sheets in as many games.

Yet despite scoring 27 times for last season, Firmino is still looking for his first goal of the new campaign even though Liverpool are the early Premier League pacesetters.

The forward has not scored in eight games for Klopp’s side and in the Premier League has one goal in his past 10 appearances, a run that dates back to March.

But Firmino’s selfless running has been singled out as one of the reasons Salah looks capable of continuing the prodigious production of last season, when he scored 44 times for Klopp in all competitions.

The Liverpool boss says there is no sense of a World Cup hangover for Firmino, whose Brazil side exited the tournament at the quarter-final stage.

“He had two weeks pre-season, which is quite short for a player who needs his physical fitness as much as Roberto does but I’m completely happy,” said Klopp.

“After two weeks’ preparation and a Brazilian holiday he is much sharper and fitter than I would have expected. It is exactly how it should be in this moment and he can improve, like we all can improve.”

Along with his mobility, Firmino’s eye for a killer pass has not been dulled by his exertions in Russia.

His superbly timed pass against Brighton last week played in Salah, who scored the game’s only goal as Liverpool moved to the top of the Premier League table for the first time in nearly two years.

Klopp has stressed that Liverpool need to improve despite the 1-0 win, and the German must decide whether to name an unchanged starting line-up for the fourth consecutive game at the King Power Stadium on Saturday.

Central defender Dejan Lovren, a World Cup finalist, is pushing for a return, although the impressive form of youngster Joe Gomez may mean that the Croatian faces another afternoon on the bench at Leicester.

With Liverpool’s front three selecting themselves, Klopp has to decide on his midfield line-up — England’s Jordan Henderson has been unable to secure a starting place so far.

Liverpool’s defence, boosted by the arrival of Brazilian keeper Alisson, has yet to concede and has the added advantage of not having to face Jamie Vardy, who announced his retirement from the England national team this week, due to suspension."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2018/08/31/firmino-eyes-end-to-goal-drought-as-liverpool-face-leicester/

IGAD meets over drought|11/05/2018|"SUNDAY SSEBAGALA

Member countries of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) have called for collective action at regional level to end the drought emergencies.

The minister of state for Karamoj, Moses Kizige while addressing IGAD’s 8th meeting of the Platform Steering Committee in Entebbe said the country has witnessed devastating impacts of climate change that have had severe effect on people’s lives and the general economic growth.

During the conference held in Entebbe, Kizige said the dry spells are so severe, that the devastating effect have taken toll on the economic potential of the region.

“People can hardly plant any crop because of the severe weather,” he said.

He added that that apart from loss of animals due to diseases, there is also tension created due to struggle for the water a cause that needs to be enhanced under the IDDRSI arrangement.

He urged members to launch the IGAD unit in Moroto to coordinate implementation of drought resilience interventions in the region.

Mohamed Moussa the director of Agriculture and Environment Division at IGAD said the initiative which is in its fifth year running has found fertile ground in responding to the challenges of the ecological circumstances in the region."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2018/05/13/igad-meets-over-drought/
