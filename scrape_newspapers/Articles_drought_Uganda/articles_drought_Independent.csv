Barty seeks to end long Aussie drought with women’s Wimbledon crown|30/06/2019|"London, United Kingdom | AFP | Ashleigh Barty goes into Wimbledon buoyed, unlike her predecessor Naomi Osaka, by being world number one and with several of her major rivals struggling.

The engaging 23-year-old Australian — who emulated compatriot Evonne Goolagong Cawley by becoming number one last weekend — has yet to get beyond the third round at Wimbledon.

However, by winning the Birmingham tournament last weekend Barty showed she has the strengths to add the grass court Grand Slam to the French Open she won on clay and become the first Australian women’s champion since Goolagong Cawley’s second success in 1980.

With 37-year-old seven-time champion Serena Williams finally showing signs of age, Osaka looking exposed through poor form and two-time Wimbledon singles champion Petra Kvitova still easing back to top form after an arm injury, defending champion Angelique Kerber may be the biggest threat to Barty.

Barty, who took an unconventional route to becoming world number one by taking a time off to play cricket, insists she feels no pressure.

“The only pressure is that that I put on myself,” she said. “To make sure that I do everything correctly and prepare as best that I can to try and play a good tennis match, try and play well, to enjoy myself.”

Barty, who says the arm problem that forced her withdrawal from the Eastbourne tournament has cleared up, admits Wimbledon is unique among the Grand Slam events in having so few lead-up events on the surface.

“Wimbledon isn’t a normal event,” she said.

“It’s a little bit bizarre coming into Wimbledon having only played one grass court tournament.

“We feel like we’ve been striking the ball really well, we’re comfortable with the grass under our feet.”

Whilst Barty says she did not know what else the draw held for her, Williams claimed not to even know the Australian was number one.

The American legend could perhaps be forgiven her ignorance given how often the top spot has changed since her era of dominance ended.

Nevertheless Williams — who claims she is over the knee woes that saw her pull out of her match with sister Venus at the Italian Open and then make an early French Open exit — believes Barty could be in for a long run as number one.

“I think so,” said Williams. “I think she has a great game.

“I think she’s really even-tempered. She’s just really chill. She’s had a really good year.”

– ‘Take the positive’ –

Williams is still chasing the elusive 24th Grand Slam title that would put her alongside Australian Margaret Court, but she was not talking up her chances.

“I just haven’t had enough match play, quite frankly,” she said.

“I finally feel like I found some good results in Paris.

“I’m just going to do the best that I can now that I’m here,” she said, adding with a smile: “I know how to play tennis.”

Osaka, for her part, says she is much more in the frame of mind she was when she won the Australian Open earlier this year than the stressed-out player who exited the French Open in the third round.

The 21-year-old says the number one spot she held earlier this year had been a millstone round her neck: “Mentally it was way more stress and pressure than I could have imagined.”

Despite a second-round defeat at the Birmingham tournament she insists she is in good shape going into Wimbledon, where she has yet to get past the third round.

“Actually in Australia I felt like normal,” she said. “I felt like how I am now.

“I feel like it (grass) should be good for me because it’s very heavily reliant on the first serves, being the first person to be aggressive.”

Kerber may have lost in the Eastbourne final to Karolina Pliskova but the German will be delighted if like last year that is the launching pad to winning at the All England club. Last year she lost in the Eastbourne semi-final only to go on and win Wimbledon.

“I will try to take the positive things from the whole week, from the last two weeks before going to Wimbledon now,” said the 31-year-old German."|https://www.independent.co.ug/barty-seeks-to-end-long-aussie-drought-with-womens-wimbledon-crown/
130 drought affected farmers benefit from crop insurance|04/12/2019|"Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | About 130 farmers in Lango sub region who lost their crops and recorded poor harvest in the first season of 2019 have been compensated. The crops were affected by inconsistent rains and prolonged drought between the months of March and June.

The affected farmers drawn from Kwania, Apac, Lira and Kole districts have since received compensation from Ensibuuko Technology, a private organization promoting crops insurance under the Market Lead User ICT for Agriculture Enable Information Services (MUIIS) Project.

Under this scheme, a farmer is required to pay about shillings 30,000 per acre to insure their crops each season. Once their crops are affected by either drought or rain, they are entitled to a minimum compensation of shillings 150,000 per acre of the crop depending on the market price.

So far about 38 farmers in Kwania and Apac districts under Apac Farmer’s Association have received compensation to the tune of shillings 6 million. In Lira district, some 13 farmers received shillings 3M while ahillings 10M was paid out to farmers in Kole district.

Martha Twesigye, the Marketing Officer Ensibuuko Technology Limited, says the beneficiary farmers subscribed to their premium crop insurance. She said those compensated lost about 80 percent of their crops in the first season.

She says a farmer’s crop yield is inspected jointly with the area agricultural officer to verify if its harvest corresponds to the normal yield.

James Ogwang Omara, resident of Amwanga village in Chawente sub county paid about shillings 150,000 as premium to insure his five acre soya bean garden and received Shillings 875,000 as compensation.

Lilly Ayugi, a resident of Aboko parish in Aduku Sub County received about Shillings 500,000 as compensation for her soya beans. Ayugi says she will use the money to improve her goat project.

Samuel Opule, the Kwania district Agricultural Officer advised farmers to embrace crop insurance due to the changing weather pattern. Opule says this will protect farmers from blanket losses due to drought or uncertainty.

Whereas some farmers have been compensated, several farmers are still unaware of the crop insurance scheme. Bosco Okello, a resident of Aduku sub county, says he has never been told about the scheme much as he would wish to join.

Okello asked Ensibuuko Technology Limited to sensitize farmers about the scheme.

Drought-hit Zimbabwe to transfer thousands of animals|12/11/2019|"Harare, Zimbabwe | AFP | Zimbabwe’s wildlife agency said Monday it would move hundreds of elephants and other animals in a dramatic bid to save them from a lethal drought.

At least 120 elephants have already died over the past two months as the country grapples with one of the worst droughts in its history.

“We are moving 600 elephants, two prides of lion comprising between five and 10 members, a pack of wild dogs, 50 buffalo, 40 giraffes and 2,000 impalas,” parks and wildlife authority spokesman Tinashe Farawo told AFP.

The animals will be moved from Save Conservancy, a major park in southeastern Zimbabwe, to three other game reserves.

“This will be the biggest translocation in our history,” said Farawo.

Permits for the operation have already been secured, Farawo said.

The transfer will start “during the rain season, when pastures and foliage start flourishing,” he added. The rain season usually kicks off from around the middle of November.

“We want to avoid a situation where we trans-locate animals, only for them to starve to death because there is no food in their new habitat,” he explained.

The relocation was announced after the death of dozens of elephants in Hwange, Zimbabwe’s biggest game reserve, located in the northwest of the country.

Hungry elephants have been breaking out of wildlife areas and raiding human settlements in search for food, posing a threat to communities.

Farawo said 200 people have died in “human-and-animal conflict” over the past five years.

Several southern African countries are in the grip of one of the worst droughts in decades, caused by months of above-average temperatures and erratic rainfall.

This year’s drought has wilted grasslands and dried up water holes, making it increasingly difficult for animals to survive.

Botswana last month announced that more than 100 elephants had died in two months in its famed Chobe National Park.

The drought has left more than five million rural Zimbabweans — nearly a third of the population — at risk of food shortages before the next harvest in 2020, the UN has warned.

Food shortages for people have been amplified by the combined effects of drought and the country’s enduring economic crisis."|https://www.independent.co.ug/drought-hit-zimbabwe-to-transfer-thousands-of-animals/
Drought, conflict driving Afghans to marry off children: UN|28/11/2018|"Geneva, Switzerland | AFP | With a devastating drought worsening an already horrendous humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, parents are increasingly compelled to “sell” young daughters into marriage to pay off debt or buy food, the UN said Tuesday.

In the drought-hit Herat and Baghdis provinces of Afghanistan, the UN children’s agency estimates that at least 161 children between the ages of one month and 16 years were “sold” over just a four-month period.

“The situation of children is dire in Afghanistan,” UNICEF spokeswoman Alison Parker told reporters in Geneva.

Speaking as an international conference on Afghanistan got underway in the Swiss city, Parker said the children in the July to October survey were “either being betrothed, married or … sold because their parents are in debt.”

“Prior to the drought, over 80 percent of households were already in debt,” she said, adding that many people who had hoped to pay off their debt when crops came in have been unable to do so.

“Unfortunately the children are now becoming the collateral,” she said.

The youngest girls in the survey, some just babies, had been betrothed while girls of 11 and even younger were married off.

Six of the 161 affected children were boys, she said, adding that “there is an increase in child forced labour.”

Parker pointed out that “the practice of child marriage is sort of a an ingrained social norm in Afghanistan,” with 35 percent of the population engaging in the practice across the country, and as high as 80 percent in some places.

“Unfortunately it is getting worse. Children are paying the price for conflict, children are paying the price for the drought,” she said.

– ‘Very shocking’ –

Members of Afghan civil society who have gathered in Geneva for the conference agreed that there had been a clear increase in young girls being “sold” into marriage.

“It is very, very shocking,” said Suraya Pakzad, who heads Voice of Women, Afghanistan.

“Girls aged between 8-12 years old (are being) sold to old men to solve the economic issues … of their families,” she told reporters on the sidelines of the conference.

She described speaking with a father who had “sold” his seven-year-old daughter into marriage, and who said he had no other choice.

She said he had told her: “I love my daughter. I know what I did. I am suffering from that. But can you give me some option?… I have five other daughters. I may not do the same to them if you give me some options today to feed my children.”

“People are in desperate need of help, services. Particularly food,” she added.

The UN refugee agency also said that the worst drought in decades has made a desperate situation worse.

The drought and ongoing conflict have seen more than a quarter of a million Afghans being displaced in the west of the country since April alone, UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch said."|https://www.independent.co.ug/drought-conflict-driving-afghans-to-marry-off-children-un/
Five years of thirst: S.Africa’s Eastern Cape battles brutal drought|14/12/2019|"Adelaide, South Africa | AFP | South African farmer Steve Bothma heaved a sigh of relief when the weatherman finally predicted rain.

His excitement was short-lived. Just a few days later, the forecast changed. It was back to cloudless sunshine.

In South Africa’s Eastern Cape province, no one can remember the last proper downpour. Some say it was five years ago, others six.

“This is a disaster,” said Bothma, 51, who in his three decades working the land has never seen such dry weather.

“Older people who are 70 or 80 years old would tell you exactly the same thing,” he added.

Southern Africa is grappling with one of the worst droughts in decades — the outcome of years of absent or erratic rainfall, and temperatures that have reached record highs.

Millions are facing hunger due to poor harvests and dwindling livestock.

“It is usually beautifully green at this time of the year,” said Bothma, as a hot gust of wind swept through his sheep pen.

“But now even the pine trees are dying.”

South Africa is one of the world’s driest countries at the best of times.

Rapid urbanisation and growing water consumption have placed a strain on water reserves and caused the coastal city of Cape Town to almost run dry in 2018.

But the ongoing drought has compounded the situation.

Dam levels dropped dangerously low in October, prompting President Cyril Ramaphosa to call for “drastic measures”.

South Africa is in “a dire situation”, said Ramaphosa in October, highlighting that five out of nine provinces were badly hit.

– To the slaughterhouse –

Bothma has had to cull around 60 percent of his merino sheep, including lambs.

Because of the drought, he could only afford to keep 2,000 as “breeding stock”.

“Usually I keep them until they are five or six years old,” Bothma explained, as his staff selected animals for the next trip to the slaughterhouse.

The price he gets for his merino wool has plunged by around 40 percent over the past year due to the drought and a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the north of the country.

“The wool is full of dust and not very strong,” said Bothma.

Years of dry weather have left scars in the landscape.

Arid fields flanked the windy gravel road leading to the nearest town of Adelaide, tucked at the bottom of a mountain range.

Cows chewed pieces of wood and sheep ambled in search of food.

In town, livestock roamed the streets and nibbled at scorched grass on the golf course.

The nearest dam dried up at the start of the year.

– ‘Can’t wash’ –

Some of Adelaide’s 15,000 inhabitants had been without running water for seven months.

A South African aid group, Gift of the Givers, has been helping by delivering water to the area since April.

On a recent water mission, hundreds of people In the township of Bezuidenhoutville rushed up with an array of empty bottles, buckets, iceboxes and even paint cans.

“We are keeping it for food and drink,” said Rodney Douglas, 59, pushing a wheelbarrow piled high with plastic jerrycans.

Assanda Sais, 38, complained that she could only spare enough water to bathe once a week and that her house was “smelling”.

“We keep dirty water to flush,” she explained.

Bezuidenhoutville’s local middle school has had to shorten its week by half a day due to the lack of water.

Many children were missing class altogether.

“Kids have to help parents to carry water,” said teacher Zeenat Gangat, sweltering as the sun beat down on the container walls of a classroom.

“They can’t wash,” she added. “They complain about stomach issues.”

– Poor infrastructure –

Local authorities have tried to ease the situation by connecting sections of the town to a reservoir fed by Fish River, around 50 kilometres (30 miles) away.

The water is allocated on a rotational basis, but even then the pipeline to the river is way too narrow.

Adelaide deputy mayor Bornboy Ndyebi said the town’s pipelines were in poor shape, and Thandekile Mnyimba, who heads the regional district of Amathole, told AFP that water trucks supplied by the government had broken down.

South Africa’s main opposition, the Democratic Alliance (DA), has accused the ruling party of acting too late.

“It is only when the dam reached a very low level – around four percent — that they woke up,” said DA councillor Ernie Lombard.

Ramaphosa has sought to pin the blame on years of poor governance under former president Jacob Zuma, whom he succeeded in 2018.

“Corruption in the water sector has in no small part contributed to the situation we currently face,” he declared.

– ‘Can’t sleep at night’ –

Water insecurity could become “the biggest developmental and economic challenge facing this country,” Ramaphosa added.

Adelaide is already suffering from South Africa’s ailing economy, marked by low growth and chronic unemployment.

Close to 70 percent of the small town’s inhabitants are out of work. When houses go up for sale, they stay on the market.

The manager of Adelaide’s only hotel said she was worried if too many rooms were booked at the same time, as “it takes two weeks to do the washing”.

On nearby farms, high-yielding avocado trees now barely produce 10, low-grade fruit instead of 50.

Helpless farmers watch their animals succumb to thirst and hunger. Alton Snaer has lost nine of his 15 cows.

“I can’t sleep at night,” said the retired farmer.

Bothma feared that more months without rain would force him “to close the books”.

“Farmers are taking their life,” he said, eyes reddened by the dust."|https://www.independent.co.ug/five-years-of-thirst-s-africas-eastern-cape-battles-brutal-drought/
Drought ignites human-wildlife conflict in Zimbabwe|11/01/2020|"Hwange, Zimbabwe | AFP | Zimbabwean villager Dumisani Khumalo appeared to be in pain as he walked gingerly towards a chair under the shade of a tree near his one-room brick shack.

The 45-year-old was attacked by a buffalo days earlier, and he was lucky to be on his feet.

Wild animals in Zimbabwe were responsible for the deaths of at least 36 people in 2019, up from 20 in the previous year.

“I thank God that I survived the attack,” said Khumalo with a laugh, making light of the fact that the buffalo almost ripped off his genitals.

Authorities recorded 311 animal attacks on people last year, up from 195 in 2018.

The attacks have been blamed on a devastating drought in Zimbabwe which has seen hungry animals breaking out of game reserves, raiding human settlements in search of food and water.

“The cases include attacks on humans, their livestock and crops,” said national parks spokesman Tinashe Farawo.

He said elephants caused most fatalities, while hippos, buffalos, lions, hyenas and crocodile also contributed to the toll.

Hwange National Park, which is half the size of Belgium, is Zimbabwe’s largest game park and is situated next to the famed Victoria Falls. The park is not fenced off.

Animals breach the buffer and “cross over to look for water and food as there is little or none left in the forest area,” Farawo said

– Starving animals –

Khumalo vividly remembers the attack.

He was walking in a forest near his Ndlovu-Kachechete village to register for food aid, when he heard dogs barking.

Suddenly a buffalo emerged from the bush and charged, hitting him in the chest and tossing him to the ground.

It went for his groin and used its horn to rip off part of the skin around his penis.

Khumalo grabbed the buffalo’s leg, kicked it in the eye and it scampered off.

Villagers in Zimbabwe’s wildlife-rich but parched northwestern region are frequently fighting off desperately hungry game.

More than 200 elephants starved to death over three months last year.

Despite suspecting that Khumalo was hunting illegally when he was attacked, Phindile Ncube, CEO of Hwange Rural District Council admitted that wild animals are killing people and that the drought has worsened things.

“Wild animals cross into human-inhabited areas in search of water as … sources of drinking water dry up in the forest,” said Ncube.

He described an incident that took place a few weeks earlier, during which elephants killed two cows at a domestic water well.

Armed scouts have been put on standby to respond to distress calls from villagers.

But it was while responding to one such call that the scouts inadvertently shot dead a 61-year-old woman in Mbizha village, close to Khumalo’s.

“As they tried to chase them off one (elephant) charged at them and a scout shot at it. He missed, and the stray bullet hit and killed Irene Musaka, who was sitting by a fire outside her hut almost a mile away.”

– Chilli cake repellant –

Locals are encouraged to play their part to scare off animals. One way is to beat drums.

But the impact is limited.

“Animals, such as elephants get used to the noise and know it… won’t hurt them, so it does not deter them in the long term,” said George Mapuvire, director of Bio-Hub Trust, a charity that trains people to respond to animal attacks.

Bio-Hub Trust advocates for a “soft approach” that encourages peaceful co-existence between humans and wildlife.

Mapuvire suggested burning home-made hot chilli cakes to repel wildlife.

“You mix chilli powder with cow or elephant dung and shape it into bricks, once the bricks dry, you can burn them when elephants are approaching. They can’t stand the smell!”

Villagers have created an elephant alarm system by tying strings of empty tin cans to trees and poles.

When the cans click, they know an elephant is approaching and they light chilli cakes to keep it away.

Another way of keeping elephants at bay is the chilli gun, a plastic contraption loaded with ping-pong balls injected with chilli oil.

“When it hits an elephant, it disintegrates, splashing the animal with the chilli oil,” Mapuvire explained."|https://www.independent.co.ug/drought-ignites-human-wildlife-conflict-in-zimbabwe/
Drought affects simsim production in Acholi region|30/04/2019|"Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Adverse weather conditions have placed Simsim productions in the Acholi, Lango and West Nile subregions on a steep decline.

The decline in the trend of Simsim production started becoming clear among farmers in 2010 as rainfall patterns shifted by an average of two months under rising temperatures from January to April.

Farmers in the subregions say they can no longer achieve the 700 Kilograms they used to harvest from a hectare of land as droughts become more frequent in the areas.

Lucy Ajok, a Simsim farmer in Apac district says changes in weather conditions is affecting production, processing and marketing of simsim produce among smallholder farmers in the district. She says droughts affect flowering and fruiting of Simsim while too much water affects the quality of Simsim by decolouring its whitish appearance.

Mike Atube, a Simsim farmer from Lamwo district says they have also observed similar trends among farmers in Lamwo. He says farmers are coping up by increasing their land sizes.

The farmers say they have resorted to fast maturing simsim varieties or drought-tolerant varieties they acquire from agro-input dealers to achieve at least 500 Kilograms per hectare of land.

Dr Walter Anyanga, a crop scientist at the National Agriculture Research Organization in Serere Research Center says the decline in Simsim production amongst farmers triggered search for tolerant crop varieties of simsim that can resist drought and too much rainfall.

Dr Anyanga says the first variety was released in 2003 while another was produced in 2013. He says both varieties have unique coping mechanisms for farmers to achieve high yields.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization say simsim production is projected to decline further over the next ten years as climate change impacts the value chain. It says production will decline from 1.5 tonnes per hectare down to 0.2 tonnes per hectare in the run-up to 2050.

At this time, temperature is expected to rise by three degrees Celsius over 2.8 degrees Celsius over South Western part of Uganda and about 2.5 degrees Celsius over the Central and Northern part while Eastern part will experience a 2 degrees Celsius rise over the short and long rainy seasons.

According to FAO, the temperature rise will frustrate farmers the more as large farmers utilize approximately 20 acres of land. It says in 2010, Uganda was the fifth global producer of Simsim, achieving peak production of 216,000 metric tonnes in 2012.

In 2018, the Netherlands Development Organization SNV commissioned a study to assess the risks of climate change on Simsim in the sub-regions.

Dr Confidence Duku, one of the researchers who participated in the survey says findings indicates that climate change affect the simsim value chain in various ways. He says they found that droughts have become too frequent around the growing seasons of simsim across the sub-regions.

Dr Duku who is attached to Wageningen University in the Netherlands says shortening of the long rainy season falling between March and May and the subsequent rise in temperatures over the short rainy season (October to December) is affecting simsim production.

Simsim is a staple food amongst the Acholi, Lango and in West Nile. It replaced cotton as cash crop due to its resilience to adverse weather conditions such as droughts among these ethnic groups. Any threat to the crop is a direct threat on their livelihoods.

It is projected that Uganda’s economic losses from agriculture sector will reach 1.5 Billion US Dollars by the year 2050 unless farmers adopt Climate-Smart agriculture practices such as the use of irrigation in order to build resilience, improve household income and productivity.

Serena ends three-year title drought, gives winnings to bushfire appeal|12/01/2020|"Auckland, New Zealand | AFP | Serena Williams ended a three-year title drought and donated her winner’s cheque to victims of the Australian bushfires in an emotional WTA Auckland Classic final on Sunday.

Williams raised expectations for this month’s Australian Open, where she can equal Margaret Court’s record of 24 Grand Slam titles, with her 6-3, 6-4 victory over Jessica Pegula — her first WTA trophy since she won in Melbourne in 2017.

But the 38-year-old tempered celebrations as she donated her US$43,000 winner’s cheque to the Australian bushfire relief fund and described how the tragedy had affected her deeply.

“I’ve been playing in Australia for over 20 years and it’s been really hard for me to watch all the news and everything that has been happening in Australia with all the fire and… animals and people that have lost their homes,” she said.

“I decided at the beginning of the tournament… I’d donate all my prize money for a great cause.”

It is Williams’ first title since 2017 — and her first as a mother — since she won the Australian Open while pregnant. Her 73 WTA titles now stretch across four decades, after she won her first in 1999.

The tournament top seed slipped 1-3 behind in the first set against the unseeded Pegula, a fellow American.

But once she found her range there was never any doubt about the final result, which Williams greeted by raising her arms in triumph while her husband Alexis Ohanian and two-year-old daughter Olympia looked on.

“It’s been a long time, I think you could see the relief on my face,” she said, adding she could feel her game sharpening up as she prepares to head to Melbourne.

“It definitely feels good, it feels like I was definitely improving as the week went on and obviously I needed to.”

– Yelling with every point –

Pegula, who has only one title to her credit, had stunned former world number one Caroline Wozniacki — a close friend of Williams — in a three-set semi-final, winning every game in the deciding set.

The 25-year-old continued in the same fearless vein at the start of the final, seemingly untroubled by her heavily bandaged left thigh as she chased down everything Williams delivered and even broke in the opening game.

Pegula held her own serve and appeared set to break again when Williams, by this stage yelling with every point she won, fought back from 15-40 to hold her second service game on the fifth deuce.

Williams eventually achieved a break of her own to level at 3-3, finding the power and precision that had deserted her until then.

With her confidence boosted, Williams held to love in the next game, broke Pegula again and then served to clinch the first set.

Pegula was down 0-40 at the start of the second set before rallying to hold serve but the strain of facing the player who has dominated women’s tennis for two decades was showing.

Williams broke on Pegula’s next service game and stayed in front until the end to take the title and extinguish a sequence of five defeats in finals since her 2017 win in Melbourne.

Williams, whose last tournament was the US Open in September, was looking for as much game time as possible in Auckland and an hour after winning the singles crown she was back on court partnering Wozniacki in the doubles final.

However, the pair were beaten 6-4, 6-4 by Americans Asia Muhammad and Taylor Townsend."|https://www.independent.co.ug/serena-ends-three-year-title-drought-gives-winnings-to-bushfire-appeal/
Spurs ready for trophy charge after 11-year drought, vows Alli|07/01/2019|"London, United Kingdom | AFP | Dele Alli has pledged to end Tottenham’s 11-year wait for a major trophy as his side head into an explosive League Cup semi-final showdown with Chelsea.

Tottenham haven’t won a leading competition since they beat Chelsea in the 2008 League Cup final.

But Tottenham midfielder Alli is convinced the north London club will finally add to their trophy cabinet this season.

Tottenham are still in the Champions League and FA Cup, and also have an outside chance in the Premier League title race.

But it is the League Cup that presents their first opportunity to end the silverware drought, starting with their last four first leg clash against bitter rivals Chelsea at Wembley.

While the League Cup is often written off as an after-thought for the top clubs, England star Alli is adamant Mauricio Pochettino’s team must use the tournament as the catalyst to kick-start a successful period.

League Cup glory would also secure a first major prize for Pochettino, who is widely regarded as one of Europe’s brightest young coaches but has yet to win a single trophy in his managerial career with Tottenham, Southampton and Espanyol.

“I think every game, every competition, you want to win it,” Alli said.

“As players you want to get as far in the cup as we can, hopefully win it.

“We want to win trophies, that’s our aim and we’ve been playing well.

“We’ve been getting quite far in recent years without quite having the finishing product at the end and not getting over the line.”

Tottenham crushed fourth tier minnows Tranmere 7-0 in the FA Cup third round on Friday as Pochettino used only three first-team regulars in a bid to keep his key men fresh for the Chelsea tie.

Alli was one of the trio who featured in the rout at Prenton Park and he expects Pochettino’s plan to pay dividends against the Blues.

– Consistency –

“Some people maybe expect you to prioritise different things, but I believe we’ve got a strong squad,” Alli said.

“Players work hard in the gym and on the training field to make sure we’re fully fit and the manager makes changes.

“I think he’s very good at that and as players we want to play every game anyway.

“We’ve just got to make sure everyone is on it and keep up the consistency because that’s the big thing.

“When you’re going into different competitions, you can’t take your foot of the gas. You’ve got to be consistent and keep up your top level.”"|https://www.independent.co.ug/spurs-ready-for-trophy-charge-after-11-year-drought-vows-alli/
Hopeful Messi keen to end Argentina title drought|11/06/2019|"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil | AFP | With Neymar sidelined by an ankle injury, Lionel Messi heads into the Copa America this weekend as the competition’s main attraction but one with a desperate need to end more than a decade of hurt with Argentina.

The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has one of the most impressive trophy hauls in football history but there is a glaring void when it comes to national team accolades.

Four Champions League crowns and 10 La Liga titles with Barcelona are not matched by Argentina success.

And the 31-year-old knows he’s running out of time to rectify that anomaly.

“I want to end my career having won something with the national team, or at least try to do so as many times as possible,” he told Fox Sports last week.

Four finals played with Argentina, four defeats, including the last two Copa finals on penalties against Chile.

But the most painful was the 2014 World Cup final to Germany at the iconic Maracana, where Messi will hope to return on July 7 for the Copa title decider.

That Germany defeat began a run of losing finals in three successive years and after the last of those, a bitterly disappointed Messi announced his international retirement.

He and his team-mates came in for a torrent of abuse and criticism.

“People were attacking us from every side,” he said.

His retirement lasted just six weeks, though, and it was his hat-trick in Argentina’s final qualifier that secured a 3-1 win in Ecuador that sent the team to the World Cup in Russia last year.

But, as so many times before, Messi was unable to recapture his Barca form while on international duty and dejection followed as the albiceleste were sent home in the second round after a 4-3 defeat to eventual winners France.

But while Messi then missed Argentina’s next six matches — all friendlies — there was no talk of retirement this time.

His son Thiago “loves it when I play for the national team,” Messi told Fox.

But the disappointments have kept piling up despite a 10th La Liga crown secured in May.

– ‘Beautiful cup’ –

Messi had made no secret at the start of the season that winning the Champions League for the fifth time was his priority as he wanted to bring that “beautiful cup back to Camp Nou”.

Things looked so good as Barca took a 3-0 advantage to Anfield for the semi-final second leg last month.

What happened next — an inspired Liverpool stormed to a 4-0 victory and 4-3 aggregate success — left as bitter a taste in Messi’s mouth as had the Germany loss five years ago.

“To lose a final of the World Cup is the most important of all, it is a big disappointment,” he said in May.

But he admitted that the Liverpool loss felt a bit worse “because we were winning and we didn’t expect them to come back”.

Messi has long been talisman for club and country but he will be even more so in Brazil with a rejuvenated squad full of inexperienced campaigners.

But that hasn’t dampened expectation either within the group or the country as a whole.

“We’re going there with the same hope and desire as ever. Argentina is going through a process of change with young and new lads,” he told TyC Sports last week.

“For most of them it’s their first official tournament, but that won’t stop Argentina trying to win the competition,” he added.

It’s 26 years since Argentina last won the Copa America, despite contesting four of the last five finals.

“It’s been a long time since Argentina won it and we all want to celebrate again, us and the fans want a title.”

None more so than Messi himself, who turns 32 on June 24, the day after Argentina’s final group B game against invitees and 2024 World Cup hosts Qatar, the reigning Asian champions."|https://www.independent.co.ug/hopeful-messi-keen-to-end-argentina-title-drought/
World parliament assembly calls for action on famine, drought in Africa|07/04/2017|"The 136th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly chaired by Uganda’s Rebecca Kadaga, ended on Wednesday with the adoption of the Dhaka Declaration calling for urgent international action to save millions of people from famine and drought in parts of Africa and Yemen.

The five-day assembly in Dhaka also took a resolution on the role of parliament in respecting the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of states, promoting enhanced international cooperation on the SDGs, financial inclusion of women in particular.

Presenting the remarks of the African Geo-Political Group to the Assembly, Kadaga thanked the people of Bangladesh for the conducive environment and organization of the 136th Assembly.

She expressed gratitude to the assembly for adopting the emergency item on famine and drought, which she said was prevalent in many African countries, including Uganda.

Kadaga applauded Bangladesh for their role in peacekeeping missions and to the recognition accorded to women. “This country has a female Head of State and Government, a female Speaker, a female Leader of the Opposition, and has for a long time maintained a large contingent of women peacekeepers serving with the Blue Helmets,” she said.

In their Dhaka Communique, the Assembly urged parliamentarians to play their role to bring relief to the millions of people facing starvation and death and and to also put pressure on their governments to fund humanitarian relief operations to avert the crisis. Over 650 Members of Parliament from 132 countries have been meeting in Dhaka from April 1-5, 2017.

“Our parliaments should be more representative, accessible and transparent. We must strengthen international cooperation to improve the quality and quantity of aid to Less Developed Countries, support fair trade practices, and to ensure fairer representation from LDCs in global economic and financial governances,” the communiqué reads in part.

The President of the IPU, Saber Hossain Chowdhury, took pride for the successful organization of the Meeting, which he called a defining moment in the history of Bangladesh.

“We will always remember Dhaka as the city where the IPU Television started its journey. This is the first Assembly, which is also going to be a Green Assembly,” he said.

He lauded the Assembly for pioneering the empowerment of women with new rules to the IPU where one third of Members of the Executive Committee will now be women, and young parliamentarians will have representation in the Executive Board of the IPU.

The Secretary General of the IPU, Martin Chungong, was reappointed for a four-year term to serve at the helm of the organization. Chungong called for an end to extreme inequalities which he said come at a high cost to society, stalling economic progress, undermining the democratic process and social cohesion and increasing the risk of violence.

“To reduce inequalities, efforts are needed at national and international levels, including strengthening legal frameworks, making parliaments more representative, making the economy work for all, strengthening social dialogue and human capital and improving international cooperation”, said Chungong

Osoru addresses IPU Assembly

Mourine Osoru, the president Forum of Young Parliamentarians made her maiden speech to the IPU Governing Council with a call to the world parliamentarians to demonstrate action and ensure youth inclusion in employment and political leadership. Osoru was elected last Sunday to the helm of the parliamentarian’s youth body.

Osoru, also Arua woman district woman member of parliament, said the priority is readdressing inequalities to young people in the political, economic and social spheres.

“We cannot remain passive when young people are constantly deprived of basic rights such as the right to education and health,” she said, adding that “Young women’s empowerment is also fundamental for inclusive societies. We call on you, dear colleagues, to prioritize oversight of government policies and resource allocations in this regard.”

Osoru’s remarks to the IPU Assembly come ahead of a regional meeting in Sri Lanka on the role of young parliamentarians in advancing inclusive and peaceful societies and preventing violent extremism. The meeting is scheduled for 25-26 April 2017.

The meeting aims at building awareness of young people about issues of youth radicalization into violent extremism and identifying action areas to be taken by young MPs.

The meet is jointly organized by the IPU, the Parliament of Sri Lanka and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

This was the biggest international event in the country so far and about 1,350 delegates from different countries and international organizations took part in it.

Uganda’s delegation to the 136th IPU included, Rebecca Kadaga, also leader of the delegation, Latif Ssebaggala (Kawempe North), Raphael Magyezi (Igara County West), Osoru Mourine (Arua), Hon. Mukoda Zabwe Julie (Mayuge), and Francis Mwijukye (Buhweju County).

The next IPU Assembly will be held in St. Petersburg, Russia in October 2017.

Worsening Ethiopian drought threatens to end nomadic lifestyle|13/02/2018|"Dabafayed, Ethiopia | AFP | Down a sandy track past a desiccated animal carcass lies a cluster of half-built huts that Ethiopia’s government and aid agencies hope will blunt the worsening toll of repeated droughts.

The soon-to-be village of Dabafayed is intended as a new, permanent home for once-nomadic herders made destitute by the country’s back-to-back droughts.

The lifestyle change is drastic but necessary, officials say.

“We can’t talk about a normal state of affairs anymore when drought has become almost perennial,” said Achim Steiner, head of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), during a recent visit to the resettlement site.

If predictions prove correct, Ethiopia will soon face its fourth consecutive year of drought, with the lack of rain hitting pastoralist herders worst.

Robust responses by Ethiopia’s government and foreign aid agencies, and the absence of war, have prevented a repeat of the disastrous famines of the 1970s and 1980s that killed hundreds of thousands.

Ethiopian officials argue the policy of relocating rural communities to areas closer to roads, clinics and schools — known as “villagisation” — drives development, but rights groups say it is forced displacement designed to better control the population.

With competing humanitarian emergency demands the UN and aid agencies are seeking strategies to enable drought-prone areas, such as the southeastern Somali region where Dabafayed is located, to weather the months when water cannot be found.

– ‘Where will I go?’ –

Though they have trekked this arid region with their livestock for generations, some ethnic Somali herders say they are ready to settle down rather than face what seems like drought without end.

“You can count on the government, and the NGOs are there giving us assistance,” said Halima Hussein, a resident of a displaced persons camp for herders such as herself whose animals have died of thirst.

“It will be at least better than staying in the bush and herding animals.”

Somali herders can lose everything during drought: from their wealth in the form of animals, to their portable homes, which need pack animals to carry them.

Halima experienced all of this. “We lost our animals. Where will I go back to?” she asked, waiting in line with dozens of other women to draw water from a borehole.

Ethiopia is drought-prone but the Somali region has been badly affected in recent years, forcing aid agencies to last year seek $1.4 billion (1.1 billion euros) to respond to the water shortage.

Donors pledged all but a fifth of the money asked, but Ethiopia’s humanitarian situation worsened when fighting intensified last September between the Somalis and Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group, the Oromos, killing hundreds and leaving a million homeless.

The UN believes it will need $895 million to respond to this year’s drought and Ethiopia’s parliament this month chipped in five billion birr ($182.7 million, 148.9 euros) for disaster response, state media reported.

These emergency funds pay for food, water and fodder that keeps people and animals alive, but officials say it ultimately does little to alleviate the privation of drought-hit nomads.

“The climate is changing, there’s more people in this region, and new ways of making a livelihood are going to be needed if we’re going to find a way through this problem,” said Mark Lowcock, the UN’s top aid official.

The Somali region is desperately poor, lacking the economic dynamism of other parts of Ethiopia. The UN says it will assist resettled herders to become farmers.

More than four million people are estimated to live across Ethiopia’s Somali region.

– Crisis into opportunity –

Aid workers are trying not only to get emergency food to hungry people but to come up with ways to prevent them from starving in the first place.

Beyond just cushioning people from future droughts, the UN’s Ethiopia head Ahunna Eziakonwa-Onochie said the strategy is to offer services such as schools to nomadic communities that were otherwise hard to reach.

“How do we turn a crisis into an opportunity?” Eziakonwa-Onochie said.

“Now that they are forced, actually by the circumstances… into sedentary kinds of lives, we start to see that opportunity to provide education in a more consistent way for the kids.”

The nomadic herder lifestyle is common across Africa and has long defied government attempts to change it.

But Ethiopia spends more time and money exerting control over its people than most, and officials say they believe they can reshape Somali herders.

“If we give pastoralists water and they don’t have to go 50, 100 kilometres to find it, is that not good?” said Anwar Ali, humanitarian advisor to the Somali regional state.

“We’re not changing the nomadic lifestyle, we are just improving it.”

Halima is among those eligible to live permanently in Dabafayed. Despite knowing no other life but the nomad’s before the drought took it all away, she’s ready for the change.

“I’m not going anywhere, I don’t have any place to go,” she said. “This will be my permanent arrangement.”"|https://www.independent.co.ug/worsening-ethiopian-drought-threatens-end-nomadic-lifestyle/
Messi ends Chelsea drought to give Barcelona last-16 edge|21/02/2018|"London, United Kingdom | AFP | Chelsea manager Antonio Conte rued one costly mistake as Lionel Messi gave Barcelona the upper hand from the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie by salvaging a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.

Messi struck for the first time in nine games against Chelsea 15 minutes from the end, as Andres Iniesta punished the English champions once more when he intercepted Andreas Christensen’s slack pass across his own box to tee up the five-time World Player of the Year.

Willian’s fine strike just after the hour mark had put Chelsea in command after he had hit both posts in the first half.

Chelsea must now score when they travel to the Camp Nou on March 14 to have any chance of making the last eight.

“Against this opponent, this type of player like Messi, (Luis) Suarez, Iniesta, if you make a mistake you pay,” said Conte.

“There is a bit of disappointment. But at the same time this game must give us a lot of confidence to trust that in the second leg the qualification is open.”

Nine years on from combining for a stoppage-time equaliser in a highly controversial semi-final at Stamford Bridge to send Barca to the final, Iniesta and Messi swapped roles as this time the Spaniard provided the pass and Messi the finish.

Resultado positivo, pero nos queda mucho trabajo para la vuelta. Gracias a nuestros aficionad@s que han estado en Stamford Bridge ???

A good result, but we have a lot of work left for the second leg #ForçaBarça ?? pic.twitter.com/sdXWIiklO7 — Ivan Rakitic (@ivanrakitic) February 20, 2018

“We failed to create clear-cut chances despite having domination of the game. In the end it came from an error from them and we took advantage,” said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde.

“It is a good score given we were behind and clearly there is everything left to decide in the second leg.”

Conte sprang a surprise before kick-off by leaving out both Olivier Giroud and Alvaro Morata with Eden Hazard instead operating in the middle of a front three."|https://www.independent.co.ug/messi-ends-chelsea-drought-give-barcelona-last-16-edge/
Starvation looms as food runs out in drought-hit Ethiopia|22/06/2017|"Warder, Ethiopia |Chris Stein, AFP | The Somali people of Ethiopia’s southeast have a name for the drought that has killed livestock, dried up wells and forced hundreds of thousands into camps: sima, which means “equalised”.

It’s an appropriate name, they say, because this drought has left no person untouched, spared no corner of their arid region. And it has forced 7.8 million people across the whole of Ethiopia to rely on emergency food handouts to stay alive.

But by next month, that food will have run out, aid agencies say.

Droughts are common in Ethiopia, and in past years the government and international community have mounted impressive efforts to curb starvation.

This year though, Africa’s second most-populous country is struggling to find the money for food aid, say aid agencies.

“We’re looking at the food pipeline actually breaking, so the food is running out in about a month’s time,” said John Graham, country director for Save the Children. “After that, we don’t know what’s going to happen.”

– Distracted donors –

Once a global byword for starvation and poverty after a famine in 1984-85 killed hundreds of thousands, Ethiopia has seen its economy grow rapidly in the last decade. Health indicators such as infant mortality and malaria deaths have also improved.

A stronger economy allowed Ethiopia to spend an impressive $766 million (683 million euros) fighting one of its worst droughts in decades in 2015-16.

This year however, things are different.

Economic growth has slowed, due in part to protests spurred by long-simmering grievances against Ethiopia’s one-party state.

Donors have also been distracted by other regional crises.

To the southeast, Somalia is suffering from severe drought, with warnings it could tip into famine.

Ethiopia’s western neighbour, South Sudan, has suffered four months of famine, and extreme hunger is at its highest levels ever after more than three years of civil war.

Ethiopia by contrast has a strong central government and is relatively free from conflict.

But with the situation so desperate in the region, donors aren’t responding to the country’s emergency as they have in the past, said Mitiku Kassa, head of Ethiopia’s National Disaster Risk Management Commission, Mitiku Kassa.

“They are stressed with the needs, especially from those countries which (have) declared famine,” Mitiku said. “That is why it is underfunded.”"|https://www.independent.co.ug/starvation-looms-food-runs-drought-hit-ethiopia/
Double curse: After drought, Kenya’s Dadaab refugee camps hit by floods|27/04/2018|"Dadaab, Kenya | AFP | The children can’t believe their luck: storms and showers have turned their dirt football pitch into a lake. Youngsters scamper and splash through the murky water, chasing one another, leaping and laughing.

Any entertainment is welcome in Dadaab, one of the biggest refugee bases in the world. An estimated 235,000 people, most of them Somalis, live a bleak life largely defined by drought, dust and destitution.

But the children’s fun is fleeting. The seasonal rains also bring cholera and malaria, destroy rickety hand-made homes and paralyse the aid operation that is the refugees’ lifeline.

Some tracks and paths in the camps are thigh-deep in water. A woman gathers her soggy hijab about her as she wades through it. A man rolls up his trousers as high as he can but they still get wet. Progress is slow.

“We have nowhere to sleep… the water has covered everything,” said Hassan Yussuf, a 34-year-old father of five.

The earth floor of his home, built of thorny sticks and corrugated tin, is under 20 centimetres (almost eight inches) of water.

– Search for dry land –

The family has relocated to the foot of a nearby tree, their meagre belongings hung in its branches.

Inside their hut only one bed remains, above the waterline for now. On it and still dry lies Yussuf’s blind, 80-year-old mother.

“I hang out in one place or another, always looking for somewhere dry,” he said, hoping the night will not bring more floods.

“Dadaab is located on a plain where the rainwater does not drain easily, there are no drainage systems and no nearby river,” explained Caleb Odhiambo of charity Save the Children, which works in the camps. “It can be several weeks before the water returns to a normal level.”

In the meantime, pit latrines are overflowing, contaminating the water and threatening to spread disease.

Cholera is the greatest danger, especially for children who play in — and anyone who drinks — the contaminated waters.

Every year rainy-season cholera outbreaks infect many hundreds of the refugees who have fled cycles of civil war and famine in Somalia since 1991."|https://www.independent.co.ug/double-curse-after-drought-kenyas-dadaab-refugee-camps-hit-by-floods/
Government to divert money from roads to mitigate drought, hunger|12/12/2016|"President Museveni opens war on environmental degradation. ‘It’s causing death and destruction’

President Yoweri Museveni has said government will suspend some road projects and divert money to help mitigate the current drought and hunger situation in the country.

“People can’t die of hunger and we focus on roads,” Museveni said before handing over relief items of 600 bags of maize flour (Posho) and 300 bags of beans to the district leadership in Namutumba. He emphasized that the elderly and less able people be the priority to get food aid.

According to reports, drought has plunged East Africa into the worst food security crisis Africa has faced in 20 years. More than 11.5 million people are currently in need of food aid. According to finance Minister Matia Kasaija, the ongoing drought in several parts of the country is the largest threat to the projected growth in the economy of five percent.

Museveni urged communities to restore granaries to store food, grow drought resistance foods and engage in commercial agriculture for both food security and incomes saying this will help them save. He said foods like cassava and millet can be stored comfortably to fight hunger.

He also urged Ugandans to engage in cost effective enterprise selection and mix to maximize profits by growing things like fruits, coffee and engaging in improved animal and crop breeds. He urged them not to fragment their land as it loses value.

Museveni said that apart from pushing for food aid, he was opening a war on environmental degradation. He walked over three kilometres across Mpologoma swamp and bridge to see the damage done as the sun set Saturday.

To highlight the environmental problems in the area, Museveni invited Rosa Malango, the United Nations Resident Coordinator and Resident Representative for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to join him on the tour. She promised to support efforts by government to reclaim degraded swamps.

Malango said she accompanied the President to see what is happening with the food security situation and the wetlands and to share areas of cooperation.

“We need to protect water sources and reclaim wetlands. Support livelihoods through modern agro production (Irrigation), support small business enterprises and build improved storage facilities (Granaries or Stores),” she said.

Government to reclaim degraded swamps

The President who made on spot visits; first to Kaliro district, then to Namakoko swamp in Namutumba district and later a marathon walk across river Mpologoma on the Iganga-Tirinyi-Mbale road said the country needed to put on “new spectacles” to address the issue of drought and starvation that are causing death and destruction.

“When making an alarm for people to eat food, you are not too loud because you don’t want many people to turn up, but when making an alarm for war, you make it so loud so that many people can come to your rescue,” he said, explaining why he had to reach out to the United Nations to partner with government to reclaim degraded environs.

The President used anecdotes to highlight the gravity of the problem, said as the country was pushing the development agenda including roads, electricity, schools, health facilities alongside the campaign for wealth creation for poverty eradication, he got a call that drought has affected crops and the changing climate seasons and little rains have caused destruction.

“When you go to the bush and a small stick hits your eye, it is telling you to see properly. This drought and hunger are the stick telling us to see properly,” Mueveni said.

According to the Museveni, the drought has been caused by two factors – 60% of our rain comes from China and Indian Ocean winds. Rain from the oceans is little this season and the cold currents reduced the amount of water. 40% of the rain comes from our local resources like Lakes; Victoria, Kyoga, Albert, George, Edward etc and from the wetlands.

“People started invading wetlands and planting rice, maize and making farms like in Kigezi and Ankole. Even the 40% of our water sources are affected. That stick is hitting us in the face. We need to see properly now,” he said.

While addressing a rally at Iwungira Primary school playground, Ivukula county in Namutumba district, Museveni said government intends to install solar water pumps at water sources to pump water into reservoirs and serve the communities instead of letting people invade the swamps in search of water.

“We need to sit and agree on how to reclaim swamps. People are drying swamps. If the swamps are dry where shall we get water to pump? When God was creating these wetlands he knew the reasons why and now people who are settling there are saying God did not know what he was doing. We are now seeing the consequence, he said, adding that ” I want to forgive those who invaded swamps. Government was lazy, it was not engaged in serious agriculture so people went to the rivers to find water. Now we shall use science and get water from the rivers to the people and also encourage irrigation, mulching and improved animal and plant breeds.”

With route to Uganda risky, drought and hunger set to hit South Sudan|20/10/2016|"Aweil, South Sudan | AFP |

A serious food crisis in the north of South Sudan is reaching critical levels, as a biting drought across much of east Africa serves up even more woes for the troubled country.

In Northern Bahr Al Gazal it is not the incessant cycles of violence wreaking havoc elsewhere in the country that concerns locals most, but the lack of rain and a deep economic crisis.

At a clinic run by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in the town of Aweil, Lucia Adeng holds her three-year-old son Wek Wol Wek, his breathing shallow and rapid and his skin paper thin around his emaciated arms.

“It’s not always a total lack of food, but there is definitely a shortage. Sometimes we have food at home, and sometimes we don’t,” she says.

Several children like him lie silent in their mothers’ arms, their eyes downcast, as they are poked and prodded by doctors. The clinic is currently recording about 60 cases of malnutrition a week, according to MSF.

Out in the fields, farmer Tong Deng looks miserably at his damaged sorghum crops and tiny yield from the lack of rains. For others, when the rains came, it was too much, with sudden massive downpours in August causing flooding which also ruined their crops.

“Our harvest has been low because during the planting period the hunger situation was very severe for us and we were not able to cultivate much land. We were hungry,” Deng.

“At the same time, what we cultivated suffered a dry spell which didn’t allow a good germination, and later the few crops were affected by the sorghum midge.”

At the local market, several stalls are closed and offerings are meagre.

40 percent going hungry

The World Food Programme (WFP) warns that as many as 4.8 million people – about 40 percent of the country’s population — were going hungry and that the situation would only get worse.

The Famine Early Warning System Network (Fews Net) last month said some households were already at the “catastrophic” famine level 5, meaning “starvation, death, and destitution are evident.”

Others were going several days without a meal, placing them in “emergency” level.

With roads from Sudan blocked to trade goods, and those to Uganda fraught with danger due to clashes between government and rebel forces, the inflation in prices of certain cereals is as much as 1,000 percent in some states, according to the National Statistics Bureau.

A depreciation of the South Sudanese pound has also hit hard.

The Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) says that more than 70,000 people from the region have migrated to Sudan to escape the harsh conditions.

In other parts of the country, it is fighting between opposition forces loyal to former vice president Riek Machar and his rival President Salva Kiir that has displaced hundreds of thousands, severely impacting the cycle of planting and harvesting.

South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in July 2011. According to the reports of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), food insecurity has increased 500 percent since 2012.

The country descended into war over the political rivalry between Machar and Kiir in 2013, and a fragile peace deal signed in 2015 is in tatters, with fighting erupting again in July and a surge of violence in recent weeks.

The Pacific warming El Nino caused one of the worst droughts in decades in 2015 across eastern and southern Africa and the 2016 rainy season has been slow to start, meaning the crisis could drag on for several months."|https://www.independent.co.ug/route-uganda-risky-drought-hunger-set-hit-south-sudan/
NARO tips farmers on drought, Fall Army Worm|01/06/2017|"The National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) has advised farmers to pay attention to their gardens to counter possible threats related to the Fall Army Worm that recently hit maize farmers in 65 districts of Uganda.

Speaking on the sidelines of the World Bank’s Open Day event at Kololo Airstrip on May 30 Micheal Otim, the senior research officer at NARO told farmers “monitor closely your garden and spray using the right chemicals.”

Otim listed the chemicals farmers could rely on, saying Striker, Dudu Fonus, Roket and Truban would eliminate the pests. He said that these chemicals are available on the Ugandan market.

If not countered, the African army worm could potentially cause a 50% crop loss, according to Otim.

Government officials and international bodies like the International Monetary Fund have revised GDP growth for Uganda to 3.5-4% this financial year (2016/17) from the earlier projections of 5-6% partly due to drought that failed agricultural crops in most parts of the year.

Government and experts worry that the Army Worm [and drought] could make the already bad situation worse if not quickly managed.

Imelda Kashaija, the deputy director general in charge of agriculture technology promotion at the research body said that countering drought and Army Worm requires early planting of drought and pest resistant varieties for the common crops.

“Visit NARO institutes that are near you to get more details,” Kashaija said.

She said that for cassava, they recommend NAROCASS1 and NAROCASS2 which are resistant to cassava mosaic and tolerant to cassava brownstreak virus. She said that there are specific varieties for beans, suit potatoes, maize that NARO is recommending and are found at Victoria, Pearl, Fica and Naseko – all companies dealing in farming seeds.

NARO was among the over 50 government agencies and some few private companies that exhibited their work at the one day Open event that attracted over 1000 people.

All exhibitors at the event are connected to the World Bank’s development programmes in the country.

Charlotte Kemigyisha, the Principle Public Relations Officer for NARO told The Independent that over 800 technologies have been developed and used by NARO using World Bank’s financial and related support."|https://www.independent.co.ug/naro-tips-farmers-drought-fall-army-worm/
Drought shatters Turkana’s dreams of a better future|05/04/2017|"Lokamarinyang, Kenya | AFP | In just a few years water, oil and money would flow. Roads, schools and hospitals would follow. Turkana’s generations of poverty and neglect in Kenya’s arid north would end.

But it was not to be: five years after the discovery of oil, and four since a giant aquifer was found, drought has struck again, shattering the dreams of a different future for Turkana, a bone dry region of dust and stone, home to mostly semi-nomadic livestock herders and lacking the most basic trappings of modernity.

In the remotest areas, hungry children with anaemic eyes and swollen bellies go to clinics where food and medical aid are delivered in dribs and drabs, while the carcasses of dead animals — killed by hunger and thirst — are piled outside their villages.

Water wells have run dry or brackish, often, their pumps are broken.

“All our animals are dead, and the only water to drink is dirty and makes us sick,” said Ekiru Ekitela, her neck slung with countless colourful beads. Others have resorted to eating the remains of dead animals, saying “it’s that or nothing.”

The end of March is supposed to bring rains transforming the barren plains around the village of Lokamarinyang in the Kibish region in Turkana’s far north into pasture, but so far there is none to water the desperately dry land.

To the south, in Karioreng village, Akalale Esekon tried to breast-feed her infant child, but no milk came so the baby screamed with hunger. “He sucks, thinking that something is going to come out, but when my stomach is empty, there is nothing for the child,” she said. Her four-year-old daughter Atabo lacks strength enough to cry.

Her black hair had faded to a sickly brown and her upper arms were no thicker than a ping-pong ball.

Compounding the drought is population growth in Turkana — at 6.4 percent a year, it is twice the national average — which means already scarce resources are quickly exhausted by people and their livestock.

– Promises unfulfilled –

Kenya is not Somalia or South Sudan, neighbouring nations where war and state failure help drive starvation. It is instead the region’s biggest economy and a stable if faulty democracy, but Turkana feels like another country.

“The image of Kenya as a middle income country doesn’t do justice to the reality on the ground,” said Werner Schultink, country head for the UN children’s agency, UNICEF.

Far from the agricultural south, where 90 percent of the population live, Turkana is a vast, poor region regularly ravaged by drought.

The hunger is greatest in the north. In the Kibish region, squeezed between Ethiopia and South Sudan, more than half of children aged six months to five years are suffering from acute malnutrition, according to UNICEF.

In the early part of this decade, politicians made rash promises of rapid modernisation that would consign to history decades of deliberate marginalisation, first by British colonialists and then by Kenya’s governing elite in Nairobi, who shared a disdain for the pastoralists and their way of life.

“Expectations were disproportionate,” said John Nakara, a Turkana parliamentarian. “Those changes don’t happen in five years, but in 20, at least.”

That didn’t stop the promises. An ambitious plan for roads, railways and oil pipelines crossing northern Kenya was launched with great fanfare in 2012, but has been slow coming.

Instead Turkana remains crisscrossed with dirt tracks that become impassable when it rains, and where the few sealed sections are so badly potholed that drivers prefer the dirt shoulders.

That same year, British company Tullow Oil announced the discovery of large crude reserves in Turkana.

Production is expected to begin in June, but local and national officials are still arguing over distribution of revenues and no pipeline has yet been built, meaning the oil will have to be trucked to the port of Mombasa, more than 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) away.

– Little oil, less water –

In 2013, Kenya and the UN cultural body, UNESCO, thrilled to announce the discovery of a gigantic aquifer beneath Turkana that promised irrigation and enough water for all.

The promise was of sufficient water for the whole of Kenya for 70 years, but the reality proved different: deeper underground and less pure than predicted, the aquifer has proven hard to exploit.

“The announcement was very optimistic and based on very limited information,” said Sean Avery, a Kenya-based consultant on water issues.

The picture, however, is not uniformly bleak: political devolution has handed more power, including the power to disburse funds, to local authorities since 2013, facilitating the opening of new health clinics in Turkana that cut in half the distance people have to walk to seek diagnosis or treatment.

Kenya has declared this year’s drought a “national disaster” and appealed for international aid.

Three million people are in need of emergency humanitarian assistance, and, while the response has been more effective than the last time, in 2011, still more needs to be done, aid workers say.

“In the current situation, this is clearly not enough,” said Schultink.

As the drought bites, the road ahead looks longer than ever for Turkana: some 92 percent of its 1.4 million people live below the poverty line and only a fifth know how to read and write, a figure four times lower than the national average.

Observers say education must be listed among the region’s many priorities as it holds the key to diversifying the economy and offering opportunities beyond herding livestock across an ever-drier land.

“There will be more droughts,” said Nakara. “We need to be prepared to face them.”"|https://www.independent.co.ug/drought-shatters-turkanas-dreams-better-future/
Severe southern African drought to worsen|28/10/2016|"Maputo, Mozambique | AFP |

The impact of the most severe drought to hit southern Africa in 35 years is expected to worsen in the coming months, a UN climate envoy warned Friday.

“The crisis has yet to peak,” Macharia Kamau, special envoy on El Nino and climate, said at the end of a four-day trip to Mozambique.

The devastation, which has affected some 18 million people across the southern African region, will be at its worst around January next year, he said.

Mozambique, with 1.5 million people reeling from the drought, is one of the worst-hit countries, along with Zimbabwe, Malawi, Lesotho and southern Madagascar.

“For many children, women and the elderly, the next few months will be about looking at survival straight in the face,” Kamau told reporters in Maputo after visiting water-starved districts a few hours’ drive from the capital.

“Frankly, what I saw there saddened and shocked me. We saw stretches of land, bone dry and desolate,” he said.

Some parts in Mozambique have not seen rains for three years, according to the country’s natural disaster management agency.

The Southern African Development Community (SADC) in August launched an emergency aid appeal for $2.9 billion (2.7 billion euros).

For Mozambique, $200 million is required “immediately” but only 57 percent of that has been secured, said Kamau.

Drought in the region has been blamed on the El Nino weather phenomenon which occurs every two to seven years, affecting rainfall patterns by causing both drought and flooding."|https://www.independent.co.ug/severe-southern-african-drought-worsen/
Planting trees on that bare hill could save you painful droughts|29/09/2009|"By Enock Nimpamya

Of recent, different parts of Uganda have been severely hit by unexpected drought spells characterised by deepening water shortages, crop failure and abnormal rise in temperatures. Global average surface temperatures have increased by 0.7°c since mid 1800 and future climate change impacts will be significant, affecting people and biodiversity globally. Studies by US scientists have underlined the inevitability of climate change even if greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are severely reduced. Under the most optimistic emissions scenario, global temperatures will continue to rise by up to 0.6°C over the next 100 years.

These are at least immediate visible effects of drought damage. This is the beginning of the worst moment we have to brace ourselves with.

Despite the good environmental policy regimes especially on conservation like National Environment Management Policy (1994), National Environmental Statute (Statute No. 4 of 1995), National Policy for the Conservation and Management of Wetland Resources of 1995, Forestry and Tree Planting of 2003, among others, many have remained merely on paper.

However, Forestry and Tree Planting Act (2003) which divided the forest reserves into Central under NFA and Local reserves under the Local government, has resulted in creation of 506 Central reserves and 200 Local forest reserves. At least this is a promising trajectory in the conservation of water catchments though far from reversing the tragic effects of climate change so far felt. Despite the recent government’s exercise of large scale tree planting and conserving certain areas as forest reserves, it is not uncommon to find highlands in different parts of the country bare and massively encroached on.

Thus, environmentally related disasters are getting both more frequent and serious in the country. There are two broad reasons for these increases. First, as population and poverty increase, more and more people live on vulnerable land like steep hillsides and flood plains. Our lifestyle patterns and chiefly poor farming practices must be reckoned with.

Second, the Earth’s natural defences against disaster are becoming ever more eroded. For example as forests and trees (which absorb the rain) are cut down and wetlands (which soak up floodwater) are drained.

Hills and mountains are the principal water catchment areas albeit almost all the hills and mountains in the country are encroached on.

Encroachment and destruction of trees and green cover in highlands across the country have generally translated into decreases in production or income and thus in the availability of food, declining soil fertility, massive soil erosion, deterioration in water quality and quantity and rise in temperatures in the area. Rivers like Rwizi, Kafu, Katonga, Kagera and Nyamwamba have suffered severe reductions in their water volumes. Many streams have dried up in different parts of the country while others are on the verge of extinction. These changes have cosmic effects like changes in river runoff which affects the yields of rivers and reservoirs as the recharging of groundwater supplies. An increase in the rate of evaporation will also affect water supplies and contribute to the salinisation of irrigated agricultural lands.

Thus, planting of trees and forests could reduce on the drought spells and possibly reduce on the rate of water loss.

Forests and trees have an important moderating influence on carbon dioxide levels, both for what they can add and what they can remove. Tropical deforestation and burning of wood contribute 20-30% of the world’s annual carbon dioxide emissions (IPCC, 2000). Yet trees are also responsible for close to 70% of all carbon absorbed by vegetation. Any carbon dioxide contributions on a global scale caused by deforestation are more than offset by the sequestration capacity of forests and agriculture. The Kyoto Protocol recognises forestry as an appropriate sequestration vehicle and that forestry can have significant influence on global carbon levels. The good thing about forests is that they are not dependent on any new science or technology. They can be designed to generate many collateral environmental and social benefits like flood/erosion protection, biodiverse wildlife habitat and restored ecosystems. You can plant them immediately at relatively low cost.

Dr Govindasamy Bala, an atmospheric scientist at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in the US, has shown that only tropical rainforests are beneficial in helping slow global warming.

The state of forest and green cover in Uganda is messy. Destruction and encroachment on the forest cover are most visible and it’s expected to become worse given the high population growth rate. Over the last three decades, Uganda has lost a number of hectares of forests. It is estimated that the forest cover has fallen to 3.5 million hectares in 2005

‘We have been observing using satellite imagery that over the last 15 years we have lost more that 1.5 million hectares of forest cover,’ Xavier Mugumya, Uganda’s forest management specialist at the National Forest Authority, told Reuters recently. This immense loss is as a result of global warming and human activities.

It is apparent that unless the status quo is remedied, the forest cover will be a nightmare soon.

What is clear though is that there is no single solution to global warming and climate change. However, the environmental benefits of trees and forests are manifold, but they have to be supplemented with other strategies of protecting the environment. It is from this account that existing natural forests must be protected and more reserves be created.

It is thus prudent that the government of Uganda makes it compulsory to plant trees and forests on all the bare hills and mountains across the country. Otherwise unless we change many of our lifestyle patterns, the country will face dire environmental damage and human suffering. We should not wait for that moment.

Drought ravages Lesotho as water is exported to S.Africa|13/08/2016|"Sephareng, Lesotho | AFP |

For farmer Mohlakoane Molise, the view of the enormous Katse dam from his smallholding high in the mountains of Lesotho taunts him daily.

His country is suffering through its worst drought in 35 years, but the vast and vital water reserves remain out of reach, destined instead for export to neighbouring South Africa.

“I am very angry about that water, because it could benefit us, we could use it to water the crops when there is a drought. But that’s not happening,” the 65-year-old widower told AFP.

Kneeling in front of his round, thatch-roofed hut, he sorted through his maize, examining each grain, one-by-one.

The operation didn’t take long. His total annual harvest filled just two large sacks, in place of the usual dozen.

According to the World Food Programme (WFP), the 2016 harvest for Lesotho’s primary crop maize is estimated at 25,000 tonnes, a dramatic drop from last year’s 78,000-tonne haul.

Instead, the mountainous kingdom –- entirely landlocked by South Africa -– must import food from its larger neighbour.

But it too has been hit by the drought after the El Nino weather phenomenon wreaked havoc on the region’s rainfall patterns, and maize prices have sky-rocketed by 60 percent in the last year.

According to the United Nations, 40 million people across southern Africa risk malnutrition by next year’s harvest.

“From September, we’ll have nothing left and we’ll struggle to buy maize from the shop,” said Molise.

Below, the immense dark blue of the dam stood out in stark contrast to the bare, brown mountains.

‘It’s like a desert’

The valley here was flooded in the nineties to make way for Katse. The deal: hydroelectricity for impoverished Lesotho in exchange for a reliable water supply to the bustling cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria.

“There were fields around the river before the dam was built, and there were trees, but they are covered by water,” said Molise.

“Since the dam is here, it’s difficult to get water. The crops are very poor, even the grazing land. It’s like a desert.”

In Sephareng, the village tap has run dry for months. Residents must instead make their way up the mountain –- a good half-hour walk along a rocky trail –- to a communal pump. There, a feeble trickle of water fills their buckets, while their cows and donkeys drink from the small puddles left behind by a vanishing stream.

For its part, Africa’s second-largest dam is fulfilling its mandate, despite the drought.

“The level today is about 63.4 percent, which is quite low,” said Tatuku Maseatile, Katse acting branch manager for the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA).

“We are still able to meet our annual targets in terms of both generation and water transfer.”

From his office high up on the soaring dam wall, he had an unparallelled view of the waters below.

“I do think people are benefiting from the dam,” he said, ticking the projects off: a water supply system, construction jobs, two industrial fishing projects, schools.

“And roads in the mountains, tarred roads brought by the project -– another direct spin-off -– and a clinic built and transferred to the government.”

Disastrous consequences

Along those tarred roads, women trudged uphill for hours to reach the clinic for the WFP’s monthly food distribution.

“We give them four packs each,” explained Mamakase Grace Sello, 21, a nutrition student interning with the WFP.

“It’s for lactating or pregnant mothers, and infants below the age of two. But we know that often the whole family eats some, including the fathers, even if they should not. The nutrients are for the babies.”

In a country where the overwhelming majority of families depend on their own crops for food and where nearly a quarter of the population is affected by AIDS, charities are predicting disastrous consequences by next year’s harvest.

Earlier this year, the Lesotho government declared the drought a natural disaster.

“I’ve never seen a drought like this,” said shepherd Ntoaesele Mashongoane, 32.

“This drought is really terrible, especially for the pregnant sheep. They don’t have enough grass and there’s no water.”

His flock moved down the steep mountainsides to the water’s edge for a drink –- a small consolation -– and the deep blue of the dam reflected the skies above, not a raindrop in sight."|https://www.independent.co.ug/drought-ravages-lesotho-water-exported-s-africa/
Farmers count losses, gains from drought|08/09/2009|"By Patrick Kagenda

Many have known it for sometime but latest figures from the Uganda Bureau of Statics (UBOS) show the full extent of the current nationwide drought on consumer prices.

The UBOS, which are based on statistics regarding the general change in prices of pre-selected consumer items in July, show that price levels changed at a higher rate than last year.

Price inflation, which is the measure of the general change in the price levels, rose by 0.5% in July compared to 0.3% the previous month. Figures for August were not yet out as we went to press but are likely to indicate a higher rate of inflation.

‘The main inflation driver remained food inflation,’ the UBOS statement said. However, a quick survey done in shops and markets and among agricultural products producers around Kampala showed that one man’s pain over inflation is another man’s gain.

Food products have also seen dramatic increment in their prices as a result of growing regional demand, especially the South Sudan market. A kilogram of maize meal is up from Shs 1,200 six months ago to Shs1, 800 today, beans from Shs 900 to Shs 1,800 a kilogram, groundnuts from Shs 1,800 to Shs 2,800 a kilogram, and rice from Shs 1,600 to Shs 2,200 a kilogram.

But diary products have seen the most dramatic rise in price levels because of drought in the main production centre, western Uganda.

Between end of July and mid-August the price of milk in Kampala shot up 100% from Shs 1,300 to Shs 2,600. Over the same period, a kilogram of cow ghee shot from Shs 6,000 to Shs 10,000.

‘There is neither grass nor water in the cattle rearing areas’, said Morrison Rwakakamba, the Uganda National Farmers Federation (UNFF), resident consultant /manager policy research and advocacy, ‘Because of this situation milk production has dropped by 30% among the big farmers while among the smallholder farmers it is below 50%’.

The big farmers are fetching water from distant places using trucks, which is not the case with the smallholder farmers.

Managers of Uganda’s leading processor of milk products, Sameer Agricultural and Livestock Ltd said in spite of capacity to process 450, 000 litres of milk per day, they were receiving only 300,000 litres per day because of the drought.

‘We had received a US$4 million dry powdered milk order but because of the scarcity of milk we failed to deliver on it,’ said Anoop Sharma, the chief executive officer.

He said, however that farmers have benefitted.

‘We increased farm gate prices to between Shs 600 and 700 from the Shs 280- 350 before the drought to get the milk,’ said Anoop.

Beef prices have, however, remained unchanged at between Shs 4,500 and 5,000 per kilogram.

Apparently, the drought has forced farmers to get rid of their cattle by selling them at a give away price. A cow that costs Shs 500,000 during the normal times is now being sold at Shs 30,000.

The UBOS figures for July indicated an easing in the price levels of some commodities including matooke, Irish potatoes, onions, beans, rice, maize floor and bread. But sweet potatoes, cassava, fruits and vegetables increased.

Price changes are likely to remain a major issue of concern for most consumers whose purchasing power is being eroded by the double digit rates of inflation over a two year period.

Meanwhile, top diary farmer and industrialist James Mulwana of Jesa Mixed Farm is challenging farmers to adapt to the changing climate. Mulwana says because he practices modern farming, he has not been affected all that much by the drought. ‘It has affected my out growers because they rely on traditional farming methods,’ he said.

Rwakakambe says, however, that agricultural institutions like the National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS), National Agricultural Research Organization,(NARO) , research centers like Kawanda, Namulonge, Kacwekano, Serere and others should work with farmers and plant drought resistant nutritious grass that can be used in hard times.

‘The other important area that needs urgent attention is the water preservation in the cattle corridor areas. We need heavy investment in valley dams to store water so that when there is a drought it doesn’t take people by surprise,’ he said.

For now, the Uganda Meteorology Department has announced heavy rains starting in September. As a result, you may expect the prices of food to either remain stable or reduce."|https://www.independent.co.ug/farmers-count-losses-gains-drought/
