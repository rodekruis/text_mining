However, Majumbi cattle market which is usually crowded every Thursday remained deserted all through yesterday with several empty kraals. The Few available animals looked bonny and emaciated, our reporter observed.

Ntoroko district is prone to prolonged droughts which mostly affect cattle keepers. Statistics from the veterinary office indicates that more than 500 herds of cattle have died in the past three months.

Sylvia Kamakune, a resident of Majumbi trading centre says that she has lost twenty head of cattle in a space of two weeks. Kamakune says that the cattle had no pasture and water since it had all dried out while at the same time, the valley dams constructed three years ago are all empty.

Sam Mijumbi, another cattle keeper says he lost ten head of cattle during the last one month due to alck of water and pasture. Mijumbi says that the few existing water dams are dirty and the water is not good for livestock consumption.

Michael Baguma, the Ntoroko District Veterinary Officer, says that last year, Bright Rwamirama, the State Minister for Animal Husbandry promised that Ntoroko district will be included on the list of cattle corridor districts and will benefit from water dams, however none of the facilities have been constructed."|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2014/03/drought-kills-cattle-in-ntoroko/
ARVs Drought Hits Kabale Hospital|24/06/2014|"Kabale regional referral hospital has run out of the second antiretroviral drugs living hundreds of people living with HIV stranded.

Second-line antiretroviral therapy achieves durable viral suppression in three-quarters of patients and is associated with an increase in CD4 cell count.

Lawrence Kwikiriza, one of the people living with HIV/Aids in Kabale says he has not been able to access the medicine since mid May this year.

He says the failure to access the drug might have far reaching implications on his life. Godfrey Byamukama, the chairperson of Persons living with HIV/AIDS in Kabale district says unless there is immediate intervention the drug stock out is a big setback on the lives of members.

He says despite the fact that the drugs are available in pharmacies, many people living with HIV/Aids can’t afford them while other are shy to buy them for fear of being stigmatized.

Emmanuel Ganshanga, the senior coordinator antiretroviral clinic Kabale Regional Referral Hospital says many patients have gone without the drug since the beginning of this year.

He says they expect the next supply in August 2014.

Kalanda Hopes To End Goal Drought|11/10/2013|"Frank Kalanda hopes to get back on the goal trail for former Uganda League champions Uganda Revenue Authority Football Club.

Lucky to win a place in the 2014 Africa Nations Championship qualifier in August after Tony Odur and Patrick Edema pulled out late, the URA star made his first international appearance as a substitute against Tanzania in the first leg in Dar es Salaam and scored twice in Kampala to ensure Uganda progressed to her second appearance in the continental showpiece.

And the former Express FC forward lost his predatory touch, managing to put the ball in the net just twice to salvage URA pride during the Cecafa Kagame Club Championship in Darfur, Sudan.

The powerfully built 22-year-old, who is expected to make the starting line-up when the tax-collectors tackle Masaka LC in the Fufa Super League on October 15, believes the drought can end against the Southern side.

“Masaka are not that strong and this game offers a good chance for me to start scoring again,” he said in an interview ahead of a warm-up to the game.

“I have settled in well and many of the players are happy playing with me because they think I add something special. I will continue to work hard for the club,” added Kalanda.

While Kalanda has still failed to get his name on the score sheet for URA FC in the local league, the likes of Ali Moses Feni (5 goals), Augustine Nsumba (2 goals), Saidi Kyeyune (2 goals) and Milos Ilic have taken care of business to keep the team top of the table with a better goal difference ahead of second placed SC Victoria University.

URA FC handled by former Cranes international Paul Nkata have 17 points from seven matches played and are among the only two teams together with SC Victoria University that are still unbeaten.

“I have played important roles for the team so far although the goals are not yet coming. I will soon start scoring and everyone will start wondering,” the striker concluded."|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2013/10/kalanda-hopes-to-end-goal-drought/
M7 Blames Developed Countries For Drought In Africa|27/03/2014|"Developing countries and to a greater extent the developed world are to blame for the drought in Africa due to uncontrolled industrial policies.

Speaking at the closure of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development meeting on Thursday, Ugandan President Museveni said developed nations are the major polluters of the environment and should take responsibility and cut their emissions.

He insists that this is the new form of aggression by the developed countries being done through climate change which Africa needs to resist very seriously and collectively demand justice.

President Museveni said he recently flew over the Rwenzori Mountain 5000 meters above sea level that used to have a large cover and sheet of snow cap and glaciers, however there were much smaller snow caps on four of the five peaks that used to have snow which is a dangerous sign.

He noted that this phenomenon of climate change which affects the whole globe is to a large extent man-made, a result of lifestyles, deforestation, pollution from industrialization and others.

However, President Museveni says the IGAD countries and Uganda are also to blame for strategic mistakes such as delay in industrialization and inadequate electrification leading to the excessive reliance on biomass for energy.

He also cites destruction of wetlands and forests, but also overstocking of domestic animals which causes soil erosion and silting of the water bodies such as rivers, wetlands and lakes.

He disclosed that in Uganda about 32.8 million cubic meters of wood is destroyed per annum for firewood.

President Museveni quoting scientists says the West Nile region in Uganda has got much more rain than Karamoja despite the fact they are on the same latitude. This is because the swamps in South Sudan and the Forests in Congo create more moisture for the West Nile region to get more rain thus warning against destruction of wetlands and eviction of peasants.

President Museveni says this requires adequate funding.

The IGAD members also noted that it is cheaper to invest in early warning and early action than it is in emergency programs. There is need to invest more in preventive measures and early warning which should be linked to early action.

There was also a call to facilitate and support communities in the arid and semi- arid areas of IGAD to invest in complimentary livelihood resources.

The European Union representative Debrouwer Jean Louis pledged strong support to the process of ending drought emergencies by investing differently. Debrouwer says it is their duty to engage in resilience building and addressing vulnerability.

Recently the World Board of Directors approved 122 million dollar fund to strengthen the resilience of pastoralists in Kenya and Uganda in the first phase. Ethiopia, South Sudan and Somalia will come in a second phase. Mustapha Ndiaye the World Bank Country Representative in Uganda reveals that out of the 122, five million US Dollars grant to IGAD to strengthen its mandate to coordinate resilience in the Horn of Africa.

The IGAD meeting which closes today is being held under the theme investing differently.

This is the second IGAD meeting on resilience after the Nairobi summit which called for a Multi Donor Trust Fund for the IGAD Drought, Disaster resilience and sustainability Initiative."|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2014/03/m7-blames-developed-countries-for-drought-in-africa/
Govt Tells Drought Hit Areas To Use Food Sparingly|27/07/2013|"Only about 1,500 people in famine hit Karamoja region are being targeted with food support, according to the minister for relief, disaster preparedness and refugees.

This is just a small fraction out of the 530,000 people at risk of starvation following the long drought in most parts of the country.

Minister Hilary Onek in a statement on Friday noted that 60 districts country wide are severely affected by famine. However, he describes the situation as one of concern but not insurmountable.

Reports indicate that over 40 people have died in Karamoja with half of the deaths occurring in Kaabong district. Sub counties that have recorded deaths include Kamion, Lodiko, Kapedo and Lolelia in Kaabong and Napak districts.

In other parts of Uganda affected by food shortages, the government encourages people to use available food stuffs sparingly. The current food shortage in the affected areas is projected to persist through August, September and October before it eases in November this year when the next harvest is expected.

The situation is being blamed on the abnormal heavy rains that caused floods, water logging and destruction of crops. Thereafter there was a severe and prolonged drought that scorched the remaining crops between late May and July 2013.

The minister said parts of Teso, Lango, Acholi, West Nile, Elgon, Busoga and Central, Bunyoro, South Western and Rwenzori experienced hailstorms leading to crop failure.

Rose Nakabugo, the Commissioner in charge of Disaster Preparedness and Management, says together with aid agencies such as the International Organisation for Immigration, UNFPA, WHO, FAO, WFP and Save the Children, government has offered emergency food supplies.

Malnourished children are being treated at therapeutic feeding centres. Bags of maize, cow peas and tins of cooking oil are being given to the extremely vulnerable households that have child headed families and the elderly.

Onek says that as a longer term intervention, the Office of the Prime Minister is currently developing a multi sectoral community resilience plan. This is intended to build resilience an adaptive capacity of communities in Karamoja to the effects of climate change and related disasters.

Alternative schemes for the affected population such as food for work; voucher for work, and direct cash transfer linked to livelihoods will be encouraged through partners like World Food Programme.

Onek also stated that government shall distribute fast maturing food stuffs like sorghum and bean seeds, and restocking of cattle will continue as alternative means of survival.

It was revealed that an arrangement similar to the Karamoja Multi-Purpose cooperative under the department of Karamoja Affairs in the areas around Lake Opeta and Lake Bisinia will be explored.

This will enable districts in Karamoja produce food throughout the year and about 10,000 hectares of land will be gazetted as a pilot irrigation scheme."|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2013/07/govt-tells-drought-hit-areas-to-use-food-sparingly/
