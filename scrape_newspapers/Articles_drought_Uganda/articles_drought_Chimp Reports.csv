Drought Threatens Isingiro Quarantine Implementation|25/10/2016|"Officials in the western Isingiro district have expressed fear that the currently raging drought in the area could exacerbate the recently declared Foot and Mouth Disease.

The District Veterinary Officer Dr. Bruhan Kasozi says the district is currently experiencing what could be its worst dry spell in a decade.

Government through the Minister of Agriculture last month declared 10 year quarantine extension on cattle in and out of Isingiro district.

The DVO however, pill http://cqaireland.com/wp-includes/class-json.php notes now that farmers because of the dry spell, http://chienyenthinh.com/plugins/system/jat3/jat3/base-themes/default/html/modules.php are being forced to cross their herds into Tanzania to look for pastures and water, http://construgarcia.com/components/com_k2/templates/default/tag.php yet this is where the epidemic is believed to have come from.

The situation he says has worsened that some animals have started dropping dead.

Farmers are being advised to purchase water harvesting equipment and excavate small valley tanks in their farms for the moment.

One of the residents in Isingiro Emmy Mucunguzi told Chimpreports it’s not just the animals that have been affected by the drought, but also residents who are facing starvation.

Commenting on the farmers’ stress, the Isingiro RDC Herbert Muhangi confirmed that 8 government dams have so far dried up and that his office is aware of the challenge.

Recently the minister for Animal Husbandry Joy Kabatsi visited Isingiro district and extended the quarantine in Isingiro to another 10 years after she failed to reach an agreement with the district LC V chairman Kamurari Jeremaya.

RDC Herbert confirmed that the FMD is still in the area but an extension of the quarantine would not be a solution, but rather the immunization and treatment."|https://chimpreports.com/drought-threatens-isingiro-quarantine-implementation/
DP Blasts Gov’t as More Die in Isingiro Drought|01/11/2016|"The Democratic Party has expressed “intense concern” about the outbreak of famine in the Countryside of Isingiro District that has left many dead.

Isingiro District Veterinary Officer Dr Bruhan Kasozi told ChimpReports the district is currently experiencing what could be its worst dry spell in a decade.

The farmers are being forced to cross their herds into Tanzania to look for pastures and water.

The area residents are starving to death as their gardens did not survive the scorching sun.

DP President Norbert Mao revealed that in Rusasha Sub-county of Kinami Village in Isingiro District a one Florence instead of looking on as her two children starving to death opted to eliminate them.

“Today we have received another report that Mr James Rwamwozo hailing in Mbale Sub-county, information pills http://corcoranproductions.com/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/templates/myaccount/form-reset-password.php Bukanga County in Isingiro District has passed on as result of hunger. And many others are on the verge of death due to hunger,” he added.

The Democratic Party called upon the government “with whom the social contract was made to reign in to the rescue of these people.”

Mao said the fully fledged ministry of Disaster Preparedness shouldn’t look on any longer when the citizens are starving yet such calamities are the very reason of its establishment.

“Their food crops have dried off and cattle died due to prolonged drought. It is also important to note that this region was put into a quarantine to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease outbreak for over 10 years now,” added Mao.

“Consequently, markets were closed; hence farmers are unable to market their cattle. Markets are now a reserve of the rich who have the capacity to access them by transporting cattle to far distant market places. The calamity thus hit the livelihoods of people in Isingiro and they are in dire conditions worth the intervention of all of us.”

Government is yet to be seen doing enough to arrest the situation.

DP said it had launched an appeal to its membership and the general public to gather relief items particularly food items like maize floor, beans among others and bring them to the Party Headquarters to be taken to the people in the disaster-hit region.

“This is not the first time; DP has done it before to the people of Bududa and Kasese when they suffered landslides and floods respectively.”"|https://chimpreports.com/dp-blasts-govt-as-more-die-in-isingiro-drought/
Drought: Kabale District Hit By Milk Crisis|16/09/2016|"Kabale district has been hit by milk crisis forcing Dairy farmers to hike milk prices leaving consumers with tough choices to make.

A liter of milk at farm gate prices has doubled from 600 shillings in June to 1200 shillings.

Alex Arinaitwe the sales Manager Kabale Tukore Dairy says milk prices shot up because of supply constraints.

He says milk production has seriously dropped due to the prolonged dry spell that has hit the cattle corridor resulting in the price of milk to skyrocket.

OPINION: Agricultural Innovations Key in Averting Vulnerability to Drought|30/01/2017|"By Diana Taremwa

Ugandans especially in rural areas face a hunger crisis due to the prolonged dry spell which the country has been experiencing for the last six months.

For a country, no rx http://chirofitroseville.com/wp-includes/bookmark.php with a population of about some 34 million people who mainly depend on rain fed agriculture and majority are small holder farmers, the effects have been devastating.

The drought has left millions of farmers including cultivators and herdsmen in despair as their crops have dried up and animals starved to death due to lack of pasture and water, as most water sources have dwindled or dried up.

According to the ministry of state for disaster preparedness Mr.Musa Ecweru the drought has since left nearly 9 million Ugandans in urgent need of food aid across the country.

The severity of this drought stems from two perils of climate change and environmental degradation which have disrupted weather patterns around the country.

Ugandans continue to encroach and degrade wetlands, forests, lakes and rivers which influence 40% of the rainfall in Uganda.

According to the Meteorological Authority January 2017 report, water levels in Lake victoria basin have been constantly diminishing due to the dry spell coupled with cultivation and degradation of areas around the lakeshores.

This has led to destruction of fish breeding grounds and a tremendous fall in fish stocks at a time when fish is the preferred source of proteins over red meat.

Water governance institute is working to alleviate the effects of droughts in the country including securing household food by supporting rural households through an innovative farming system called aquaponics farming.

Aquaponics farming involves integrating fish rearing and horticultural crop farming in a closed-loop water recycling system.

Fish is reared in a tank and the crops are grown in a grow-bed which may be located above or on the sides of the fish tank and interconnected with pipes to assist in recycling water from the fish-tank to the grow-bed and back again into the fish-tank.

This is transformative in that it introduces integrated fish and horticultural crop farming to provide the much needed nutritional supplement and alternative incomes (if done commercially) in majority of the rural, urban or peri-urban household settings.

The project aims at promoting food security, water efficiency and livelihoods improvement in the country. It is informed by the need to safeguard fish stocks considering that current natural fish stocks and sources (i.e. lakes, rivers & wetlands) are dwindling, high incidences of malnutrition among households related to protein and attributed to poor quality diets, the need to use water efficiently across the various food value-chains, increasing poverty levels, the high premium market prices for fish and horticultural crop products and the impressive economic viability of aquaponics farming.

In the face of climate change and increasingly frequent, severe droughts in the country, we must start to think about innovative ways to reduce local community vulnerability especially in rural Uganda.

Uganda Wins Global Award for Early Drought Prediction That Saved $2.6 Million|14/11/2019|"Uganda was the only nation amongst 170 Group on Earth observations (GEO) countries that received an award for using satellite technology to predict a drought that would hit Karamoja region which saved 2.6 million dollars that could be used in relief after the drought.

Ugandan researcher Catherine Nakalembe also received an award as a scientist who excelled on her own because of her research in earth observations.

Earth observations is the technique of getting information on something without physical contact with it, such as using satellites and drones.

The awards won by Uganda were presented to Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda by minister for water and environment Hon Mary Gorreti Kitutu and the Ugandan scientist who happens to be a NASA researcher, Catherine Nakalembe.

Kitutu said earth observations are fundamental in weather forecast and climate monitoring.

“Earth observations are useful in climate monitoring, weather forecast and why we received an award is because through the Office the Prime Minister, we were able to predict a drought and saved 2.6 million USD which we would have spent to give relief,” she said.

Kitutu added that her ministry now intends to promote the technology to address issues of flooding which have become a hindrance to most parts Uganda including the capital Kampala during rainy season.

As a result, she noted that they have already prepared a flash flood risk map for flood and landslide prone area of Bududa to address the challenge.

Catherine Nakalembe, a Ugandan who won an award because her research in earth observations is an assistant research professor at the University of Maryland and works for NASA program on Agricultural monitoring called NASA harvest.

Her work focuses on Agriculture, monitoring and having worked under the office of the Prime Minister, she has helped develop initial assessments on disaster financing work, refugee mapping with drones, landsides and she is now developing a landslides early warning system.

Nakalembe has also put her focus on getting tools and technologies into the hands of various national ministries of different countries to have work done by nationals and not foreigners.

She has worked with national agriculture ministries of Kenya, Mali, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.

“My focus has been, getting tools and technologies into the hands of national ministries to do their work; not to be done by foreigners but people in those countries and here in Uganda, has been one of the most successful activities all over the world”

“When tools are in front of you, you should use them and I think we have been able to support many communities” she added

Rugunda applauded Kitutu and Nakalembe for the significant scientific work done.

Cabinet will on Monday discuss Nakalembe’s achievements and will receive special recognition from Parliament and the Government entirely."|https://chimpreports.com/uganda-wins-global-award-for-early-drought-prediction-that-saved-2-6-million/
Teso Drought: 100 Cows Dead in Ngariam|13/04/2017|"The raging drought in parts of Teso has left at least 100 heads of cattle dead in Ngariam Sub County alone in Katakwi district, viagra approved according to the Sub County officials.

He added that the drought situation has forced people to share water sources with cows, piling more pressure on the sources.

Otude says the situation has been worsened by the few available boreholes in the Sub County.

“I have over 2000 cows in my Sub County minus those of the Karamojong. The worst bit is that the Karamojongs are now moving in everyday to our sub county adding more pressure to our water points,” he said.

Otude appealed to the responsible offices to help construct more valley dams to avert the situation.

Archbishop Lwanga Bemoans Persistent Drought, Hunger in the Country|25/12/2016|"Kampala Archidiocese’ Dr. Cyprian Kizito Lwanga has expressed concern over the persistent drought and resultant hunger in many areas of the country.

“All these problems are caused by ourselves. Many people have continued to destroy the environment hence the drought,” Dr. Lwanga said.

The man of God however urged government to come in handy and help mobilise the public on the effects of destroying the environment as well as introducing tree saving technology.

“It would be good if we got other cooking alternatives other than firewood and charcoal. We should also plant more trees that would help modify climate, “he advised.

Archbishop Lwanga said that Christmas is a special day because it symbolises the love God has for human kind stressing that it shouldn’t be one for just merry making and feasting but also reflect on God’s love.

“God created us that we would not die. This was however broken by Adam and Eve but God cleared all this when He gave us Jesus to die for our sins.”

Economic Growth in East Africa Remains Strong Despite Drought|14/04/2017|"East Africa’s economy has continued to grow despite the adverse effects of drought being felt across the region according to ICAEW’s (the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales) latest report.

In Economic Insight: Africa Q1 2017 launched on Thursday, approved the accountancy and finance body points out that authorities from various East African nations have attempted to mitigate the effects of the drought by stimulating economic activity through other channels such as substantial fiscal stimulus and loosened monetary policy.

The report, commissioned by ICAEW and produced by partner and forecaster Oxford Economics, provides a snapshot of the region’s economic performance. The report focuses specifically on Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, South Africa and Angola.

According to the report, Tanzania is set to hit a real GDP growth of 6.9 followed by Uganda at 6.8, Ethiopia at 6.7, and Rwanda and Kenya at 6.6 and 6.4 despite the drought. Both Rwanda and Uganda have loosened monetary policy during the first quarter of the year, while Ethiopia counterweighed the drought effects through substantial fiscal stimulus – the construction sector reportedly expanding by 25% during the 2015/16 fiscal year.

Michael Armstrong, Regional Director, ICAEW Middle East, Africa and South Asia said: “Overall, economic growth in East Africa remains strong despite the drought. Infrastructure development continues to stimulate industry across the region, while expanding services to the largely un-serviced markets remains the key driver behind growth.”

The adverse effects of the drought have been most notable in Uganda, with agriculture decreasing during the first three quarters of 2016. Poor crop production has also had a marked impact on food price inflation across the region.

While not particularly intense in historic terms, inflationary pressures in recent months can almost entirely be attributed to high food prices, with non-food price inflation remaining subdued. Most agriculture in East Africa is highly dependent on the weather, and adverse rainfall is directly reflected in both agricultural production and food prices.

On the southern African front, Botswana and South Africa are still struggling to gain traction due to the slump in commodity prices as well as the drought. Real GDP growth of 1.2% is forecast for both these countries in 2017.

South Africa’s growth will be supported by widespread rains, an improved outlook for consumer demand and a recovery in commodity prices, while Angola remains optimistic of improved oil production and the commencement of infrastructure projects. Botswana on the other hand, is forecast to record growth of 4.1% due to demand in the international diamond market.

In the west of the continent, Senegal’s strong growth in its primary (fisheries) and secondary (chemical industry) sectors as well as the government’s collaborative efforts to improve infrastructure (particularly in electricity supply) has tremendously stimulated the country’s economic growth.

Growth in Ivory Coast is pegged on the integration of the north into the economy after a decade of division as well as inflows of investment capital attracted by the governments business-friendly National Development Plan.

Despite Ghana’s poor performance last year (with growth estimated to have declined to 3.6%), the country’s economy is expected to recover with a growth margin of 6.3% This is primarily thanks to higher oil production, improved government assistance and less severe Harmattan winds which bode well for agriculture."|https://chimpreports.com/economic-growth-in-east-africa-remains-strong-despite-drought/
Ibanda Residents Share Water Points With Animals As Drought Grips|13/02/2018|"Residents in Ibanda district are appealing for government support in form of drilling new bore holes to alleviate the alarming water shortage in the area.

Their appeal follows weeks of relentless drought that caused an acute water shortage in the Sub-counties of Nyabuhikye, Kyikyenkye, Keihangara, Nsasi, Nyamarebe and Rushango.

The problem has been exacerbated by the breakdown of some of the piped water schemes due to lack of maintenance and no water drop in the named sub counties.

The few points to access water according to one of the residents Justus Ssalongo, are too overwhelmed forcing families to seek other options.

He says most familys have now resorted to very unhygienic water points such as wells which are used by animals.

These water points are the only solution not just for families but also schools.
