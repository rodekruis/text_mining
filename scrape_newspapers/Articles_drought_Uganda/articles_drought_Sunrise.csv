Greengrams; a drought resistant substitute for beans|21/06/2013|"But due to challenges posed by climate change such as prolonged dry spells, bean producers are facing more challenges arising from harsh weather conditions.

Scientists have however discovered that Greengrams, known as Choloko in Eastern Region where they are commonly grown, can withstand drought much better than ordinary beans grown in central and western parts of the country.

In an experiment at the National Semi-Arid Resources Research Institute (NaSARRI) in Serere, Scientists have succeeded in showing that Choloko does better than beans during periods of water scarcity.

A field experiment showing performance of greengrams and beans against drought conditions that is being carried out by NaSARRI scientists has clearly shown that greengrames – certainly a less known legume in Central and Southern parts of Uganda but known as Choloko, in the eastern parts, beats beats by far when it comes to withstanding water scarcity brought about by scotching sun.

As Robert Amayo, the Head of the Dryland Legumes Programme at NaSARRI, narrated, they were excited to see greengrams progress into flowering and even bearing fruits, during last month’s very dry conditions.

“We planted the two legumes; greengrams and beans at the beginning of May. And for the rest of the month, we received no rain. We were excited however, to see that greengrames thrived where beans have failed. As you can see, beans have been scorched, but greengrams are lush,” Amayo sad while pointing to the field trial, [shown in photo above].

Emmanuel Mbeyagala, the plant breader in the Dryland Legumes programme at NaSARRI told a group of visiting journalists doing a fellowship with Biosciences for Farming in Africa (B4FA) that their research has proved that Greengrams can grow in drier conditions.

He added that the fact that the legume can thrive in other parts of the country is a big source of hope that Ugandans have a crop that can help cushion families against the effects of drought.

NaSARRI scientists however acknowledged that early shattering of dried pods in greengrams has limited their commercialisation in Uganda. Because of this handicap, scientists are trying to cross different varieties of greengrams in the hope of getting one that shatters less. Using convetional breeding means like crossing, they are trying to select greengrams that produce pods above the canopy. They are also looking for varieties whose fresh pods can be eaten as fresh vegetables the way french beans are.

Major handicap

NaSARRI scientists however expressed deep frustration about the lack of modern research facilities that would enable them to accelerate the discovery of varieties with the desired characteristics.

For instance, in the absence of modern research laboratories, most researchers say they are left with no option but to use convetional techniques especially crossing of planted varieties, that are time consuming.

As Amayo noted, if only they had modern plant breeding facilities, they would be able to identify the desired characteristics much faster and as a result would be able to respond to such challenges as early shattering much faster.

Other programmes

Under the same legumes programme, the scientists have also developed a faster maturing variety of pigeon peas (Enkolimbo in Luganda), which can supplement families protein needs but also withstand dry spells because of its hardy nature.

According to Mbeyagala, the scientists have successfully tried a new variety of Pigeon Peas that can mature in 70 days compared to the traditional variety that matures in 120 days and beyond.

Mbeyagala adds that they are trying to collaborate with private companies to develop composite foods from green grams for added nutritional advantages for children, pregnant mothers who need special enhanced foods. He said for example that if green grams are added to flour made from cow peas or pigeon peas, they can make protein-enriched products crunches like Bagiya and hence help to improve the uptake of proteins.

Composite foods are made from mixing of different processed food. In Uganda, several companies like Maganjo grain millers are producing composite foods by mixing rice, maize, oats and millet flours to make highly nutritive porridge substance.

After severe drought, Teso leaders commit to tree planting|26/05/2017|"Leaders from across Teso sub-region have risen up from slumber to plant trees as a way to avoid the adverse effects of drought.

Recently, the Central Rotary Club is set to partner with Soroti Municipal council to promote tree planting in schools and other areas in Teso sub-region as one way of addressing environment challenges.

The move is in line with a recent directive by the State Minister for environment, Mary Goretti Kitutu to local governments in ensuring that they streamline the environment guidelines in order to revive the lost tree cover in the region.

Teso sub-region has recently been plagued by prolonged drought and severe famine, which has left thousands of households especially those in Katakwi, Kumi, Amuria, and Serere districts among others suffering with acute food shortage.

Dr. Joel Okalany the secretary general Rotary Club of Soroti Central noted that the tree planting campaign that the Rotarians hope to engage in will target growing of especially fruit trees such as mangoes, guavas, oranges and pine trees for wood cutting.

“In the next three years to come, we hope to have planted at least 5 million trees as Rotarians, Dr. Okalany said.

According to Okalany, they are at the initial stages of planning for the activity adding that this will be spread across schools and communities as part of the strategy to mitigate climate change and revive the lost green cover in parts of Teso.

Most district and local leaders and environment experts have time and again blamed the prolonged drought on the effects of mass indiscriminate cutting of trees by people whose livelihoods depend on charcoal burning with an aim of selling in order to earn a living.

The Chief Administrative officer (CAO) Soroti district Chuna Moses Ekapolon asked government to re-think about the tariffs being levied on power, in order for people to stop using charcoal for cooking.

“We wouldn’t want to use charcoal, but because some people cannot afford power for cooking, they resort to charcoal burning instead,”, Chuna revealed.

Recently, the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) in partnership with the Ministry of Environment made a donation of 80,000 trees seedlings to be planted in Teso Sub region as soon as the rains return.

According to information obtained from the office of the state minister for environment, each district in Teso will receive 10,000 fruit tree seedlings for planting. Teso sub region has eight districts.

On the April 24, 2017, a regional dialogue for Teso leaders’ on reconnecting local governments to effective environment and natural resources management organized by NEMA was held in Soroti district.

It brought on board district chairpersons, CAOs, district planners, environment officers, and production officers aimed at ensuring that policies in the environment sector are strengthened and other underlying issues affecting the sector performance at the local government levels in Teso Sub region assessed.

Minister Goretti Kitutu issued a directive to all district local governments to strengthen environment policies that promote tree planting in Schools.

NARO releases drought tolerant beans with ‘power-bank’ effect|28/04/2019|"The Publicly funded National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) that developed the varieties says that the NAROBEAN 6 and 7, are small seeded varieties that not only have

better strength to withstand heat stress, but are also high yielding and early

maturing.

These varieties were released on Thursday 25, 2019 by the Variety Release Committee of the ministry of agriculture.

Dr. Stanley Nkalubo, a breeder and the Head of the Beans Programme in NARO says that

prolonged dry spells have become a regular challenge to farmers especially in the central, mid-eastern, midwestern, southwestern, eastern and northern semi-arid areas of Uganda leading to

serious bean yield losses.

“As a bean breeding programme, we set out to develop varieties that yield potentially well in the intermittent/terminal drought stressed environment of Uganda,” Dr Nkalubo adds that the two varieties grow well in all-weather but outperform other bean when subjected to heat stress.

According to Dr. Nkalubo, the two varieties can yield between 21 (100kgs) bags of beans and 38bags per hectare.

The latest product of research builds on earlier successes recorded in bio-fortification of beans that saw NARO release iron and zinc- enhanced beans.

The two trace elements are considered to be extremely essential in an individual’s health development by increasing the formation of red-blood cells, and developing and improving the functioning of a person’s immune system.

Iron deficiency is a common problem in Uganda and other developing countries that leads to lack of blood.

On the other hand, zinc deficiency is associated with growth retardation, loss of appetite, and impaired immune function. In more severe cases, zinc deficiency causes hair loss, diarrhoea, delayed sexual maturation and impotence.

With the latest beans, NARO has increased the nutritional content of beans by enabling them to absorb and store more iron and zinc from the soil.

Zinc is also considered vital in boosting a man’s sexual abilities by increasing sperm count and staying power alternatively referred to as ‘power bank’ in Kampala speak.

Containing 70ppm iron, and 35ppm zinc content in both varieties, the latest drought tolerant beans meet the recommended daily nutritional requirement for all age groups.

Dr. Nkalubo says for both varieties, the research institution is currently multiplying seed to ensure it is available next planting season.

NARO’s new crop products offer hope against disease and drought|20/11/2015|"The National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) has released new food crop products for Cassava, Sweet Potato and Wheat which offer hope in addressing prevailing disease and drought stresses.

Among the new releases are two new Cassava lines NAROCASS1 and NAROCASS2 which the research organisation says are high-yielding, aromatic, sweet in taste, pest resilient, and are rich in food and high dry matter.

Perhaps more importantly is the fact that NAROCASS1 and NAROCASS2 are resistant to Cassava Mosaic Disease and tolerant to Cassava Brown Streak Disease respectively.

These two diseases are currently the biggest constraint to cassava production in Uganda and cause significant yield loss estimated at US$24.2million annually.

With a yield potential of up 55 tones per hectare, NARO says the new Cassava varieties are unrivalled compared to other types on the Ugandan market.

NARO’s Director General Dr. Ambrose Agona expressed excitement at the new releases.

“As researchers, we are excited about these new varieties and already, farmers in whose fields we have tested them have given very positive feedback on their benefits,” said Agona.

Agona said his organisation has finalized plans of multiplying and distributing the new crop varieties and has identified seed growers and seed companies for bulking and multiplication for distribution to farmers.

Maize tolerant to lethal necrosis

The research organisation has answered the cries of Maize farmers particularly those from Eastern

part of Uganda by releasing a new hybrid maize variety that is tolerant to the devastating Maize Lethal Necrosis.

“NARO maize hybrid56 (NH5556) is especially tolerant to Maize Lethal Necrosis, a deadly maize disease ravaging farmers’ fields in the East African sub-region,” says NARO in a statement.

The Lethal Necrosis-tolerant maize line is part of three new varieties, including NARO maize hybrid3 (NH5503) and NARO maize hybrid57 (NH5557) which the research body says are high yielding and offer resistance to major foliar diseases and drought stresses.

NARO says the Hybrid NH5557 is nitrogen-use efficient and very stable under low soil infertility conditions.

These advent of new varieties promise to increase and stabilize maize yield and while also improving food security and enhance income among farmers. In Uganda, maize is an important staple food and feed crop. It is the most highly cultivated crop with about 86% of the country’s households involved and consumed by a majority of those in urban areas, and institutions such as schools, prisons, and hospitals.

It is one of the top ten commodities that World Food Program (WFP) purchases from Uganda and ranks as the major export food crop for the country earning significant amount of foreign exchange.

Solution to Potatoe blight

After years of declining Sweet Potato production in Uganda largely due to the late blight disease, NARO has released three new varieties that have higher resistance to the disease.

NAROPOT 1, NAROPOT 2 and NAROPOT 3 are the latest additions to five varieties widely grown in Uganda.

NARO says: “The three varieties have a yield potential of up to 28 tonnes per hectare, compared to national average yield of 7 tonnes per hectare. They have a higher resistance to the potato late blight disease and can withstand bacterial wilt diseases.”

Uganda’s patato production has suffered serious declines over the past few years because of the late blight disease as well as bacterial diseases.

NARO observes that with increased reduced disease burden, potato production is slated to increase creating new market for the product such as potato flour.

“The release of these varieties is a major stride towards improving potato as a commodity for commercializing and hence a business opportunity for those engaged in their production. These varieties have wide adaptability and will be promoted in all agro-ecological zones of Uganda. Plans to multiply and distribute the new potato varieties to seed potato growers, who will multiply the potato seed for mass distribution to farmers, are underway,” NARO said in a statement.
