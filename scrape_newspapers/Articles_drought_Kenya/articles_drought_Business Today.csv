Politics, drought bogged down Kenya’s economy last year|25/04/2018|Growth in financial services decelerated to 3.1 percent as the impact of a law capping commercial interest rates at 4 percentage points above the central bank rate filtered into the market. Banks blame the law introduced in September 2016 for deteriorating private-sector credit growth, which slowed to 2.4% in December, the lowest annual growth since at least 2005, according to the central bank.|https://businesstoday.co.ke/politics-drought-bogged-kenyas-economy-last-year/
Drought compels nomadic women to acquire land|26/02/2018|"Northern Kenya continues to grapple with numerous environmental challenges, owing to the interference with the Ewaso Nyiro River ecosystem. The river is the single most important source of water in the region, supporting a population of more than 3.5 million people.

Over abstraction of water and unchecked sand harvesting, in addition to land degradation, have rendered livestock rearing unsustainable in the long run. This is particularly the case given that droughts have become more frequent, unpredictable and lasts longer.

Then there is the problem posed by such invasive plants such as the cactus opuntia and the acacia raficiens species, which are taking up large tracts of grazing fields, compounding further the already difficult situation facing pastoral communities in the region.

But in order to adapt to the new environmental realities, these communities have been left with little option but adopt a more settled lifestyle. The consequence of which is the inevitable breaking down of socio-cultural norms passed down from generation to generation.

Perhaps the most glaring aspect of this cultural shift appears to be taking place among the women. They are now acquiring land, something which was unheard-of a few years back, not least in a pastoral and patriarchal community as the Maasai. They are pooling financial resources and acquiring land to start small projects like poultry farming and beekeeping, with expert support from local organisations.

This is what is happening in the far-flung Osukoroi Village of Laikipia County, a four-hour drive, north of Nairobi, Kenya’s capital city.

Margaret Siole, the chairperson of the village group explains that livestock rearing has become a difficult practice, given the drought situation affecting the region. They had to look for alternative livelihood sources to make ends meet. Four years ago, they started as a very small group of 25 women and five men. They are currently 38 members. Each contributed Ksh3,000 ($30) to the group’s kitty, which they set aside for a project that would benefit members as well as the community.

“At the beginning, one of our members donated a small portion of land for growing aloe vera, from which we made hand and body lotion for sale,” she says.

Then they saw the need to increase contribution to KS5,000 ($50), which enabled them purchase a nine-acre plot of land. Their intended long-term use of this piece of land is to put a conference facility for hire, grow horticultural crops under greenhouses and start dairy farming. But first, they need to surround it with an electric fence to ward off elephants, according to Siole.

In the meantime, however, they have started with poultry, with the help of the Indigenous Movement for Peace Advancement and Conflict Transformation (IMPACT). This organisation that works with indigenous, marginalised groups – especially pastoralists – in areas of land rights and historical land injustices.

They have partnered with the Catholic Organisation for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID) – a Dutch aid body – to promote resilience and climate smart approach to livelihoods, targeting marginalised groups, especially women in this region.

The aid organisation provides funding for projects, while IMPACT implements them. This involves training women on new livelihood streams such us poultry farming or beekeeping. The group received 92 chickens and a 90kg chicken feed donated to them under this joint effort, to start them off. “We are now realising that poultry farming can be more profitable than rearing livestock,” says Jane Ntunyoi a group member.

However, one of the biggest challenges facing them, according to Ntunyoi, is poultry diseases. “We have always grown around livestock, so we know all we need to know when it comes to treating them, but poultry farming is relatively new to us and we are not familiar with their diseases,” she says.

This is where a group like IMPACT comes in, according to David Silakan, the Programme Coordinator at IMPACT."|https://businesstoday.co.ke/drought-compels-nomadic-women-acquire-land/
UK to end aid to drought-hit Kenyans in 2024|22/01/2018|"British funding of a 10-year-old aid package to drought-hit communities in Kenya is to end in 2024 as part of a new economic partnership with the country, the Guardian reports.

The Ksh 20.5 billion (£143m) programme, which has helped 600,000 vulnerable people in emergencies via direct cash transfers – a system criticised by some Conservatives as the equivalent of exporting the dole – is the first UK aid project of its kind which will be wholly taken over by a government in Africa.

In an interview with the British newspaper on her first visit to the continent as secretary of state, Penny Mordaunt said Kenya was a “profound success story” that had “stepped up and taken responsibility” by investing in its own people.

Last week, Mordaunt warned Britain would cut aid spending to developing countries if they failed to invest in their own people. Setting out her priorities as a new development secretary, she said she would focus increasingly on helping developing countries “stand on their own two feet” and pledged to use aid as a “Brexit-ready proposition to boost trade and investment with developing countries” in a mutually beneficial relationship.

Speaking in Nairobi at the weekend, she said Kenya was a perfect model of this. “Kenya is an example of a country which I think is doing the right thing.”

“There will be other nations who have said: why would they invest in vaccinations and start building up particular services because the international community is going to do it for them? That doesn’t help them transition out of extreme poverty or start building the public systems that they need to look after their people.”

Helped by DfID-backed reforms that have increased access to credit for the country’s 50 million people from 25% to 75% in a decade and removed trade barriers by cutting customs clearance times, Kenya has jumped 30 places in the World Bank’s ease of doing business rankings in the last three years.

On her visit, Mordaunt travelled to Marsabit, one of four counties devastated by east Africa’s drought, to see how the DfID-backed cash transfer system was saving lives.

The Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP) uses satellite imagery of drought-hit vegetation to identify the needy, while biometric fingerprint technology guards against fraud. The Kenyan government, which currently provides 65% of its funding, is now using it to identify disabled families.

Mordaunt spoke to women from the drought-hit communities, including the mother of a severely disabled nine-year-old boy. They told her the money – about Ksh 5,738 (£40) every two months for those qualifying as vulnerable – had changed their lives by helping them feed and educate their children and set up businesses. The scheme is also being used to help 71,000 severely malnourished children.

The secretary of state also said research showed that cash transfers, which critics have likened to exporting the dole, helped local economies offer dignity to recipients. They were better at supporting the needy than traditional humanitarian aid, “which is not as effective in reaching people it needs to and doesn’t yield anything other than alleviating that crisis”.

“Here it’s yielded a social protection system which the government in short order will be taking over completely,” she said.

DfID will continue to help fund the programme for the next five years, and has provided another Ksh 2.8 billion (£19.8m) for 2018, when it expects the drought to continue.

Mordaunt has expanded cash transfers in other areas, including to help Syrian refugees in Lebanon.

She said DfID would continue to alleviate humanitarian crises and assist people in need, as well as building in sustainability for the future.

“Using our heads in deciding how to spend that money doesn’t also preclude using our hearts,” she said.

The development secretary, who took over in November from Priti Patel after she was forced to resign, also heard from British businesses about how DfiD-backed improvements in trade had helped them tap into the Kenyan market.

She also announced a scaling up of support to trade across east Africa, providing Ksh 30.3 billion (£211m) to TradeMark East Africa, an aid programme helping remove trade barriers created by high costs of imports and exports.

The UK is the fifth largest exporter of goods to Kenya and trade between the two counties is worth more than Ksh 143.5 billion (£1bn) a year.

Cabinet tasks Matiang’i to lead drought response efforts|18/04/2019|"Cabinet on Thursday set up a committee chaired by Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiang’i to ensure that Government response to the drought situation is well coordinated. The committee has also been charged with the responsibility of putting into place mitigation measures for the remainder of the year.

During a meeting chaired by President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi, millers were warned not to take advantage of the ongoing drought situation to hike price of Unga.

Cabinet warned that stern action will be taken against those who will hoard maize and other essential food items, a dispatch from the Presidential Strategic Communications Unit said.

Cabinet also assured that Government will take necessary measures to ensure basic food commodity prices remain stable. It urged pastoralist communities to start destocking while animals are still healthy and gave an assurance of State help in restocking when weather improves.

The current drought situation has left more than 1.1 million Kenyans hungry following delay of the March-May long rains and the Meteorological Department warns the situation is set to get worse as they are likely to be minimal.

The government has already released Ksh 2 billion to support drought response efforts.

During the meeting, Cabinet also approved the Data Protection Policy and Law. The policy and law enhances the Government’s commitment to protect personal data in order to guard against misuse and eliminate the unwarranted invasion of privacy, which is a Constitutional right guaranteed under Article 31.

The move came as the government pushes to have Kenyans to register for Huduma Namba, which it says will be a single sources of information on Kenyan citizens and foreigners residing in the country. It further argues it will help in improving delivery of services but has faced stiff by those who fear the privacy of information provided is not guaranteed.

Though the High Court ordered that the registration is not mandatory and those who register should not be denied access to services as earlier threatened, Communications Authority of Kenya Director General Francis Wangusi on Thursday warned that it will deactivate SIM cards of those who do not beat the May 18 deadline.

”We are taking stock of registration and by the time the exercise ends, we shall ask the service providers to deactivate all numbers and register them afresh,” Wangusi said in Kisumu.

Also approved were the Kenya Investment Policy (KIP), and the development of the Mombasa and Naivasha Special Economic Zones. KIP aims at consolidating the fragmented investment related policy by creating a framework that establishes a strong coordinating mechanism in Kenya.

As part of the Nairobi decongestion initiative, the Cabinet approved the Development of the JKIA–James Gichuru Expressway project (The Nairobi Expressway Project) as well as the Bus Rapid Transit Line 3 under a Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement.

Too little too late: Governors react to ravaging drought|20/03/2019|"In the wake of public outrage over drought that has ravaged parts of the country, governors have moved to re-assure the public that they are doing everything in their power to mitigate the devastating effects of the drought amid the popular public opinion that the county chiefs could have done more to protect their constituents sooner.

Turkana, Samburu, Wajir, Mandera, Garissa, Baringo, Kilifi, Tana River, West Pokot, Marsabit, Makueni and Kajiado counties have been adversely affected so much that deaths have been reported in the regions, statistics which the national government has claimed are false.

On Tuesday, Kenyans took to twitter to express their anger at the situation in the aforementioned regions under the twitter hashtag #WeCannotIgnore and followed it up with another one on Wednesday #GovernorsofDrought calling out the governors for poor leadership.

Consequently, on Wednesday, the Council of Governors (COG) said that counties have distributed a total of 11,740 bags of maize, 1,500 bags of beans and 8,896 bags of rice to affected households to mitigate the effects of the scorching drought.

In a dispatch to newsrooms, the county chiefs also said that affected county governments have deployed water bowsers to distribute water to residents in the most affected sub counties.

According to COG, 290,518 bales of animal feed have been procured and distributed in the affected areas while 241,938 children have been immunized.

“The Council of Governors would like to also appreciate the steps being taken by the national government and other stakeholders to ensure that lives are saved in the affected counties,” reads the news dispatch “The national government in consultation with county governments must come up with a lasting solution so that Kenyans don’t suffer,”

On Monday, the national government denied that the situation is ‘under control’ while National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) CEO James Oduor alleged that ‘the deaths are not as a result of drought’.

“The reports we are getting from the ground is that the deaths cannot be linked directly to drought. The deaths can be linked maybe (sic) to sickness and other issues,” said Oduor.

Deputy President Dr William Ruto said that the government has released Ksh2 billion to mitigate the effects of the drought.

“Funds will ensure adequate distribution of food, life-saving aid to needy populations, water trucking and complement first-line interventions by county governments,” the DP who was accompanied by Devolution, Agriculture and Treasury cabinet secretaries said."|https://businesstoday.co.ke/little-late-governors-react-ravaging-drought/
Government releases Ksh2 billion to drought stricken regions as death toll rises|18/03/2019|"The national government has approved the immediate release of Sh2billion to drought stricken regions.

According to the Deputy President Dr William Ruto, the money will ensure steady supply of food and logistics through the Ministry of Devolution and that of Agriculture as part drought intervention strategy.

“The money is to be spent within this week in water tracking, making sure that bore holes and water pumps are working, for food supply to ensure the food is available,” said Dr Ruto.

This comes as more deaths (due to starvation) have been reported in Turkana and Baringo Counties, the most affected by drought and famine.

While two people were earlier reported to have died of starvation in Turkana last week, four more people have passed away in Baringo County due to famine as thousands risk the same fate.

Confirming the reports, Kositie sub-location chief Jack Ronei said the deaths were from Kamusuk, Kositei and Seretion areas. He described the famine situation as alarming.

Hundreds of livestock, which is the main source of livelihood, have died due to lack of water and pasture.

DP Ruto on Monday acknowledged that more than one million Kenyans across 13 counties were facing famine as a result of drought, but stressed that there was no cause for alarm as the country’s food security is stable.

On Friday, Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa flagged off only 7,000 bags of maize and beans in Turkana which is the most affected by drought and starvation.

Some residents are said to have starved for days with no single meal making them weak and unable to reach food distribution centres. Mostly affected are the elderly people and small children.

Poor rainfall last year has been attributed to the drought, with other regions reported to have received rainfall more than nine months ago.

The National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) had earlier issued drought alert in 23 counties with food security declining when three counties faced drought alert since November last year.

Could wastage at Devolution Ministry have plunged Kenya into drought crisis?|22/03/2019|"Deputy President Dr William Ruto on Wednesday boldly claimed that no Kenyan has starved to death as drought ravages Arid and Semi-Arid Areas (ASAL) counties across the country even as locals continue to report fatalities in these regions.

Kenyans have called out the national and county governments on social media for the better part of the week for failing to mitigate the devastating effects of drought that have led to deaths.

Part of the Ministry of Devolution’s mandate includes formulation of devolution policy and providing technical assistance to county governments which puts it at the heart of managing a national disaster such as drought.

But a new report has exposed the ministry for failing to account for the funds which could have gone a long way in assisting hunger stricken Kenyans in different parts of the country.

An analysis of the Auditor General’s reports on spending at the Ministry of Devolution and ASAL areas [formerly Ministry of Devolution and Planning] by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) has laid bare the Ministry’s failure to account for billions allocated to it between 2013 and 2016.

IEA’s report analysed spending of four ministries with the biggest budgets namely Devolution, Education, Health and Agriculture.

Loading...

In what seems like a serial unaccountability habit by the Devolution Ministry, IEA’s report dubbed Analysis of the Auditor General’s Reports on the Financial Statements of National Government shows that Auditor General Edward Ouko queried 49% of the ministry’s Ksh29.29 billion total expenditure in the financial year 2013/2014.

Auditor General queries of total expenditure of Ministry of Devolution budget 49% of Ksh29.29 billion in FY 2013/204

46% of Ksh32.26 billion in FY 2014/2016

52% of Ksh38.55 billion in FY 2015/2016

Ouko gave a qualified opinion for the ministry’s spending during the year. A qualified opinion means that he okayed most of the spending but still raised a few issues.

{Read: Court ruling will give banks free rein to set interest rates}

The Auditor General also queried 46% of the ministry’s Ksh32.26 billion expenditure in the financial year 2014/2015. That year the state department of planning was hived off from the ministry.

Ouko gave a qualified opinion on spending at the state department of devolution and a disclaimer opinion on spending at the state department of planning.

A disclaimer opinion means that a department’s book keeping is so flawed that the auditor general is not in a position to give an opinion.

The country’s top auditor also queried 52% of the Ministry’s Ksh38.55 billion total expenditure in the financial year 2015/2016.

That year, the auditor general gave a disclaimer opinion for both the devolution and planning state departments.

In context, the graft riddled National Youth Service (NYS) was domiciled in the Devolution Ministry until 2016 when it was moved to the Ministry of Public Service Youth and Gender in a bid to rid it off corruption.

Current Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru was Devolution and Planning Cabinet Secretary up until when she resigned in November 2015 while current Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri was Devolution CS between December 2015 and January 2018.

Eugene Wamalwa is the current Devolution CS after being appointed to the position on January 26, 2018.

“We have seen some of these ministries despite being grossly implicated in scandals, acquire more funding the next year.” IEA chief executive Kwame Owino

While the Auditor General’s queries do not necessarily translate to theft by the relevant office holders, National Assembly Public Accounts Committee (PAC) Chairperson Opiyo Wandayi said that whenever Ouko queries spending of a ministry, state department or an independent commission ‘his suspicions that funds have been looted are 99% of the times spot on’.

{See also: Standard goes big on digital with an eye on youth market}

“What happens is that the accounting officers fail to reconcile their books or fail to hand in supporting documents to the Auditor General,” said Wandayi during the launch of the report on Thursday.

He added, “The National Audit Office requires that they submit the necessary documents by September but most at times they don’t but when PAC summons them in full glare of cameras, the documents mysteriously surface.”

IEA chief executive Kwame Owino also called upon parliament to walk the talk in the fight against corruption.

“Parliament needs now needs to act on the auditor general’s reports and makes sure that public funds are used for the correct purposes,” said the respected economist."|https://businesstoday.co.ke/wastage-devolution-ministry-kenya-drought-crisis/
The funny and the not so funny aspects of Kenya’s drought|26/03/2019|"The drought situation the country finds itself in at the moment is not funny, but it is expected that once the country overcomes the devastating effects of the ravaging drought, it will be quickly thrust into mitigation mode while dealing with floods in a few weeks’ time.

Ms Jane Adika famed for the Serikali Saidia slogan is the embodiment of a casualty of wrecking floods but somehow she benefited from her plight with corporates including Safaricom lining up to make her a brand ambassador after her ‘funny’ sound byte in the aftermath of the 2013 floods that went viral.

Her countrymen and women in drought stricken parts of the country have had no such luck and are clinging to life by the straw, relying on relief food to cure their hunger, for them the situation is as dire as it gets.

Back at Nairobi, governors continue to take flak for failing to deal with the drought soon enough, they are now synonymous with failure but what’s funny is that they continue to blame the National Treasury for ‘meagre disbursements’ to the devolved units.

“The National Treasury has perennially disbursed monies to counties late. Delayed disbursements to counties means that counties are not able to adequately deliver services in time and in this case, to respond in time for the affected population,” said Council of Governors (COG) Chairperson Wycliffe Oparanya on Monday.

Take time to think about the amount of money allocated to Turkana County every year, the county is the largest recipient of disbursements from Treasury, receiving more than Ksh10 billion from national coffers every year but is still the poster-county for drought.

Speaking during a regional conference organised by the Kenya Institute of Public Policy and Research (KIPPRA) on June 5, 2018 Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich revealed that between 2008 and 2011, the total drought loss and damage amounted to Ksh968.6 billion.

On average, the economic cost of droughts and floods alone is estimated to create a long term fiscal liability equivalent to about 2.4% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

The droughts and floods between November 2016 and April 2018 are estimated to have affected over 3.4 million people and cost the government over Ksh20 billion.

The National Government further allocated Ksh1.5 billion for flood victims and another Ksh1 billion to Red Cross for supporting the evacuation and counseling of victims.

Yet the long term projects meant to address the issues for the long haul have either collapsed or are marred in scandals.

Not much is heard of the Galana Kulalu Irrigation scheme these days, it is widely presumed to have collapsed.

The country is also pondering how Ksh21 billion meant for the construction of Arror and Kimwarror multi-purpose dams in Elgeyo Marakwet County was lost in fictious deals.

There is also the issue of the government’s official position on deaths caused by the drought, the government maintains no one has died, while people on the ground continue to report fatalities.

Devolution ministry has requested for funds from the national treasury to curb the situation before turning into a national disaster.

“From our estimation is that we need between Sh6 billion to Sh8 billions to tone down the hunger arising from the ongoing famine,” said the Chief Administrative Secretary Hussein Dado to the Senate Committee on Devolution and Intergovernmental Relations.

The National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) had cautioned that arid and semi-arid regions to anticipate decline in water, food and pasture due to the declining trend of poor rainfall experienced last December.

The agency had projected that at least 23 counties will face drought across the country since November 2018 to May 2019 due to the poor rainfall and locust infestations.

The drought, according to the agency is expected to worsen in the next two weeks with starving people in the various regions being said to be too weak to reach food distribution centres.

Sh319m insurance payout for livestock|23/08/2017|"The government will pay out Ksh319 million in form of livestock insurance to farmers in six counties that were severely affected by drought and then floods during the long rains season.

Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett said that a total of Ksh319, 191,600 will be paid out to 11,407 pastoralists from Marsabit, Wajir, Isiolo, Mandera, Turkana and Tana River counties.

Bett, who was speaking during a press briefing in Nairobi Wednesday, said the payout is intended to purchase animal feeds, provide water, procure animal health services or move animals to areas with better forage to cushion them against severe starvation and possible deaths.

“In addition to livestock insurance support, the government is implementing other programmes that are aimed at improving the resilience and livelihoods of pastoral communities in the ASAL counties,” Bett said and called on County governments to set aside funds to complement government’s efforts in order to cushion vulnerable members of the society from extreme shocks resulting from drought.

The government started the Kenya Agriculture Insurance Programme in July, 2014 in Wajir and Turkana counties as a mitigation approach and to protect the livelihoods of pastoralists’ from death as a result of drought.

According to the CS, the first insurance cover was bought in 2015, covering a total of 25,060 livestock for 5,000 households at a cost of Ksh 58, 393,734 in Turkana and Wajir Counties.

This year, he said that the government has expanded the livestock insurance to two more counties – Garissa and Samburu, and a contract to cover 8,000 households and 90,060 livestock has been signed and the payment will start in October.

The government is expecting to bring all the 14 ASAL Counties under the scheme by 2018 at a total premium cost of Sh 500 million.
