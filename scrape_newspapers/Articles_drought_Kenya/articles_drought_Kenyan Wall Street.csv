East Africa's Economic Growth Remains Strong Despite Drought|17/04/2017|"According to a recent report by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales ( ICAEW), East Africa’s economy has continued to grow despite the adverse effects of drought being felt across the region.

The report dubbed Economic Insight: Africa Q1 2017 notes that authorities from various East African nations have attempted to mitigate the effects of the drought by stimulating economic activity through other channels such as substantial fiscal stimulus and loosened monetary policy.

The report, commissioned by ICAEW and produced by partner and forecaster Oxford Economics, provides a snapshot of the region’s economic performance. The report focusses specifically on Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, South Africa and Angola.

ICAEW projects that in 2017, Tanzania is set to hit a real GDP growth of 6.9 followed by Uganda at 6.8, Ethiopia at 6.7, and Rwanda and Kenya at 6.6 and 6.4 percentage points. Both Rwanda and Uganda have loosened monetary policy during the first quarter of the year, while Ethiopia counter-weighed the drought effects through substantial fiscal stimulus – the construction sector reportedly expanding by 25% during the 2015/16 fiscal year.

Michael Armstrong, Regional Director, ICAEW Middle East, Africa and South Asia said: “Overall, economic growth in East Africa remains strong despite the drought. Infrastructure development continues to stimulate industry across the region, while expanding services to the largely un-serviced markets remains the key driver behind growth.”

The adverse effects of the drought have been most notable in Uganda, with agriculture decreasing during the first three quarters of 2016. Poor crop production has also had a marked impact on food price inflation across the region. While not particularly intense in historic terms, inflationary pressures in recent months can almost entirely be attributed to high food prices, with non-food price inflation remaining subdued. Most agriculture in East Africa is highly dependent on the weather, and adverse rainfall is directly reflected in both agricultural production and food prices.

AfDB Grants Kenya Sh 100 million for drought victims|13/07/2017|"The African Development Bank Group (AfDB) has approved a Sh 100 Million (US$ 1 million) grant to people affected by drought and famine in Kenya.

This comes after the Kenyan Govt declared drought as a national disaster on 10th February 2017 as a result of extreme dry spells in pastoral zones since August 2016. These have resulted in high local cereal prices, increasing livestock mortality and conflict that have exacerbated the impact of the drought. Food prices are currently 10%-25% above their five-year averages and are expected to continue rising.

According to the government, the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance had doubled to 2.7 million in February 2017, up from 1.3 million in August 2016. “This is equivalent to 20% and 18% of population in pastoral and marginal areas, respectively. Some 357,285 children and pregnant and lactating mothers are acutely malnourished. Data collected by UNICEF from 10 affected counties indicates that close to 175,000 children are not attending early pre-primary and primary schools, primarily due to the impact of the drought.” the Government said.

Kenya’s National Drought Management Authority (NDMA), said that the drought has worsened in most Kenyan counties, now affecting nearly half the country.

For its part, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) called for assistance to the Horn of Africa Countries including Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Uganda and requested support to Drought Response Activities in Kenya to meet the urgent needs of the affected population;

In this regard, the emergency relief grant approved by tAFDB will support the Government of Kenya and UN’s efforts in providing urgent food aid distributions and deliveries of water purification supplies.

The operation will be funded through a grant from the Bank’s Special Relief Fund (SRF, to purchase food items as well as associated costs of transportation and distribution of food rations to the beneficiaries and for administrative charges. All these food items will be purchased locally by World Food Program (WFP).

Drought Affects Tea Production in Kenya|16/04/2019|"The prolonged drought situation in the country has affected tea production causing tea bushes to wither and dry out.



According to the Tea Growers Association, once the rain comes, it will take approximately 6 to 8 weeks for the crops to recover plus an additional cost to replace dried up bushes, a situation which is likely to affect the industrial performance for the year 2019.



Earlier this year, Kenya Tea Development Agency warned Farmers of low earnings this year following a decline of 17 % in the price of the beverage in the first half of the 2018/2019.



Kenya tea directorate also predicts that in 2019, the tea volumes will drop to 416 million kilos from the initial of 474 million kilos recorded in 2018.

The current drought situation in the country has prolonged

from October 2018 and is the longest one experienced.

Williamson Tea Kenya Plc and Kapchorua tea have already issued a profit alert indicating that its full-year earnings for the year ended March 2019 are expected to decline by at least 25 per cent.

The two firms cited unfavorable weather patterns as part of the reasons for the anticipated decrease in profit."|https://kenyanwallstreet.com/drought-affects-tea-production-in-kenya/
Kenya Meteorological Department Warns of Persistent Drought|19/03/2019|"The Kenya Meteorological Department has said that the current dry weather conditions in the country may prolong over most parts of the country, more so the eastern regions and the Northwestern Kenya of the country, thus affecting the March to May 2019 season rainfall.

In its season update, the met department warns that tropical cyclones and the unfavorable patterns both in the Indian and Atlantic ocean could also result in poor rainfall distribution in the Western sides of the country.

“A tropical cyclone known as IDAI, located in re Mozambican channel for several days has played a key role in delaying the northward movement of the rain-bearing Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone…the cyclone significantly reduced moisture influx into the country and has led to the continued sunny and dry weather conditions,'” the update stated.

Therefore, the long rains are expected in April (contrary to the March trend) in most parts of the country, especially in western Kenya, central Rift valley, Northern Kenya and the central highlands including Nairobi.

“In May 2019, most parts of the country are likely to experience depressed rainfall except the western central Rift valley and central Kenya regions which are likely to experience slightly enhanced rainfall,” the update stated.

The department warned that the late rainfall could likely impact negatively on the agricultural sector leading to food insecurity, a case which has already been witnessed in the country.

Problems related to water scarcity and lack of pasture for livestock is expected to increase following the poor rainfall performance observed during the October-November-December 2018."|https://kenyanwallstreet.com/kenya-meteorological-department-warns-of-persistent-drought/
