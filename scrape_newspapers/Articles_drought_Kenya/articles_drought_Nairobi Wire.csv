Prophet Owuor: ‘Why Kenya is Experiencing Drought and What Needs to Be Done’|18/01/2017|"Prophet Owuor has warned Kenya to repent and return to God in a bid to overcome the ongoing drought.

Owuor of the Repentance and Holiness Ministry says Kenya is currently experiencing drought and famine because her population and leadership have distanced themselves from God.

In a statement made by the self proclaimed prophet on Jesus Is Lord Radio, an FM station run by the church, Owuor urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to set a side a day for national prayers.

“What I see right now is famine. I see a lot of people walking. I see a lot of people walking in columns like this carrying some little containers, and so forth. So there is a famine that is coming here. And again, let me say this: I see people walking, in this land walking, walking in a large column. It looks like in the dry areas of this country. And so there is a big famine. This famine may be very big if they do not bring repentance before the Lord,” said Prophet Owuor.

“That means this nation needs prayer. I need to pray for this land. I need to pray for this country that it may rain and there be no famine. But I see a lot of famine and I see these things happen. And when you read the Bible, the Bible says very clearly that I gave you famine. I placed unto you famine. I took away bread from you. I made your teeth white. (White teeth means famine, white and long.) I made your teeth white, and yet you have not yet returned to me.

“So the Lord is asking that this country to return to Him in repentance and holiness, and then you will be able to mitigate and remedy on this famine that is coming. And again, the Lord has shown me people walking in the dry areas walking in long columns with – I see a big sauce pans or something or plate – and the Lord has shown me that. And so He is saying that there is a famine that is coming here; however, the Lord is saying that I gave you famine. I hungered thee. I made your teeth long and white, and yet you have not yet returned to me.

“So the Lord is asking for repentance in this land of Kenya. Then there must be a National Repentance where all the leadership and all the people gather as one person and go before the Lord,” he added.

“May those who have ears prepare for repentance. I know the big ministry that is here, the Ministry of Repentance and Holiness of more than 20 million people, have already begun a national repentance this Sunday, yesterday. And that repentance continues on and on nonstop until the Lord comes down again to love this country, and stop this famine.”"|http://nairobiwire.com/2017/01/prophet-owuor-why-kenya-is-experiencing-drought-and-what-needs-to-be-done.html
Pokot: This is Why We Eat Snakes Instead of Cattle, Despite Drought… and Please Allow Us To Continue Killing The Marakwet|30/03/2017|"NTV investigative reporter has just returned from the dangerous Baringo county, where cattle rustlers reign supreme.

Okari got to interview Pokot warriors, who are said to be the main aggressors in the never-ending war.

Afer travelling a long way and waiting for them even longer, the warriors started streaming in to the interview location. Nicholas Lemachia, who would soon become their ‘spokesman’, made a grand entrance dragging a 12 foot python.

Excited kids soon surrounded him with knives, ready for a feast. He would later explain that they would rather eat snakes rather than touch their livestock.

When the subject of why they were fighting was introduced, Lemachia made a case on why they should be allowed to continue killing the Marakwet.

He argued that the government has abandoned them, yet equipped their ‘enemies’ with weapons. He said that Ruto gave the Marakwet about 240 guns to kill the Pokot, perhaps referring to a recent move by the government to commission about two hundred police reservists.

He further blamed the government for taking sides, saying that they should be left to resolve the conflict themselves. Lemachia argued that the government should leave them to teach the Marakwet a lesson, until they surrender and friendship then can resume. ”Tuwachwe tupige wao mpaka waridhike..” he kept saying.

The warrior further commended retired president Mwai Kibaki for his handsoff approach, saying he ordered the government not to intervene. ”We fought for a while until the Marakwet surrendered when we killed them too much. They then asked for peace,” he explained.

Another warrior told Okari that when they attack, it is usually revenge for something the other community has done. Asked whether they spare women and children, he said that they kill anything and everything on their way.

Okari also interviewed a man whose wife was murdered while breastfeeding. He expressed anger at the Pokot, revealing that they also stole 51 of his cattle, leaving him with nothing.

“Change Your Ways or Suffer from Drought”- Akorino Prophet Warns Kenyans|25/10/2016|"A ‘prophet’ of the Akorino religious sect has issued a stern warning that Kenya will be hit with severe drought for belittling God.

Joseph Murage, 63, said that God will severely punish the country if Kenyans fail to repent.

Speaking on Sunday in the streets of Embu town, Mr.Murage added that the drought will lead to famine and death.

“I have been sent to warn Kenyans to change their ways. If they fail, they will suffer from drought. Kenyans will not hide from his message; the clouds will gather that no rains will fall,’’ he said as quoted by eDaily.

He added that the dry spell will last for a while and asked intercessors to plead with God to spare Kenya.

“I am urging Kenyans to heed this warning and beg God for Mercy in order to spare the country of this disaster.”

The prophet’s words comes as various parts of Kenya continue to grapple with drought and hunger.

Five counties in the Coast region are staring at starvation with Kilifi being hardest hit. Kinango in Kwale and Lamu West sub-counties are in the severe vegetation deficit band.

Parts of Garissa, Lamu, Makueni, Kajiado, Narok, Marsabit, Isiolo and Samburu counties have also been hit by significant shortages of water and pasture, leading to deaths of livestock.

According to the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA), the situation is threatening 1.3 million lives in Kenya.

The agency says it is preparing for a possible La Niña event, which may set up the country for more severe food shortages."|http://nairobiwire.com/2016/10/change-your-ways-or-suffer-from-drought-akorino-prophet-warns-kenyans.html
No Cause for Alarm Says DP Ruto on Kenya’s Drought Situation|19/03/2019|"The government is in control of the prevailing drought situation in sections of the country, Deputy President William Ruto has said.

In a presser on Monday morning, DP Ruto said the government has disbursed Ksh2 billion for the supply of food and water to about 1.1 million Kenyans affected by drought and food scarcity.

“This morning, the government of Kenya has approved Ksh. 2 billion to be spent within this week in water tracking, making sure that boreholes and waterpumps are working,” said Ruto.

The second in command noted that this year’s drought situation has improved compared to previous years.

“It is important to state that the situation we have this year is better than the situation we had last year and the year before,” said Dr Ruto, adding, “There should be no cause for alarm at the moment, the government has put in place both at the county and national level interventions to manage the current drought. We will work together with partners such as the United Nations agency and all other friendly institutions to ensure we don’t have any casualties as a result of this drought.”

According to the DP, a situation assessment report by the government shows that a total of 865 persons have been severely affected by the drought while 1.1 million others are being affected “generally.”

Counties facing food scarcity include Samburu, Marsabit, Garissa, Isiolo, Mandera, Wajir, Baringo, Kilifi, Tana River, West Pokot, Makueni, Kajiado, and Kwale.

Ruto said the new funding to be channelled through the Ministries of Devolution and Agriculture, is in addition to Sh12.4 billion set to be disbursed through the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection via cash transfers to 1.3 million vulnerable persons including the elderly.

“As part of ensuring there is resources around the country for people to buy food, all beneficiaries under our cash transfer program, the vulnerable old people, people with disability and orphans, the government has again released Ksh.12.4 billion to 1.2 million beneficiaries that will put them in position to be able to buy food, especially those in areas that are affected by the drought.”

Ruto said the government had put measures in place to strengthen distribution of food in counties facing shortages assuring that Kenya’s food security situation was stable.

He said the drought situation in the country had been triggered by poor performance of short rains."|http://nairobiwire.com/2019/03/no-cause-for-alarm-says-dp-ruto-on-kenyas-drought-situation.html
Uhuru Prays for Rain in Drought-Stricken Nyeri, Pours Heavily Minutes Later|23/01/2017|"He already has the title ‘President’, but now we can add ‘Rainmaker’.

For the past few days, Uhuru has been touring central Kenya to mobilize his supporters to register as voters.

This mass voter registration exercise happens to take place at a time the country is grappling with drought. Weathermen have predicted that most parts of the country will not see rain for several months. The result of which will be scenes of hunger-stricken people that have now become commonplace.

Nyeri, just like the rest of Kenya, has not been spared by the lack of rainfall.

On Friday, Uhuru was in the town and a request was made that he prays for the rains.

The president hesitated initially, saying he is not a pastor or rainmaker. But the crowd insisted which left him with little choice.

He reportedly said this short prayer in Kikuyu.

“Our God we pray for peace in our country, give us rains so that our animals have something to eat. We pray for a good harvest in our farms and growth in our country. We pray for victory.”

In what can be concluded to be a miracle or a big coincident, the heavens opened up moments later.

Heavy rainfall descended on the town, leaving residents to run for cover, believing their president is ‘anointed’.

The president was himself forced to cancel another scheduled rally at Kiganjo area due to the heavy downpour.

Well, I wouldn’t want to speculate, but he put in a few other requests in his prayer. I think time will tell whether God’s answer for the rest was in the affirmative too."|http://nairobiwire.com/2017/01/uhuru-prays-for-rain-in-drought-stricken-nyeri-pours-heavily-minutes-later.html
