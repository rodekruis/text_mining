"Drought also at a neighbor of Poland. ""Two more weeks without water and damage will be irreversible"""|26/04/2020|"On average, only three liters of rain per square meter fell in April in Germany. Farmers are alerting that grain crops are on the verge of desiccation. Forests are at risk of fires.

Only three liters of rain per square meter have fallen in Germany since the beginning of April 2020. It’s only 5 percent average rainfall calculated for this month on the basis of data collected since 1881 by the German Meteorological Service – wrote the daily “Die Welt” on Sunday.

Even if rain appears in the last days of April, the results will be similar to the driest measurements from 1893, when only 3.7 liters were recorded, and from 2007, when 4 liters of rain fell per square meter.

“We urgently need longer rainfall. Irrigation systems are currently in operation in fruit and vegetable crops. There are already signs of crop and rapeseed crop loss in some regions,” Joachim Ruwied, head of the German Farmers Association, told reporters.

“Two more weeks without water and damage will be irreversible” – described the situation Georg Maas. A farmer from Luetzow in north-eastern Germany on 750 hectares cultivates incl. corn. It has not rained in the region where it operates for over a month. Maasa crops “are on the verge of desiccation.”

Lack of rainfall also increases the risk of forest fires. “We are surrounded by dead trees,” said “Die Welt” Christiane Hopstock, mayor of Schierke, a resort in the Harz National Park. “Just a few years ago, the mountain village at the foot of Brocken was surrounded by” beautiful green spruces “, but the stand weakened the last dry bark beetle years and activities – she explained. “We live in constant fear of fire” – she added.

Due to the lack of rainfall, the Harz mountain range was covered by aviation supervision by local fire brigades. The highest levels of fire risk have already been introduced in forests in several German federal states.

In the largest German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, there have been six large and several smaller fires in recent days, resulting in 50 hectares of forest being burned.

Die Welt journalists have determined that the situation is hampered by the fact that tree exports have fallen due to the coronavirus pandemic. Because of this, fallen or felled trees are not removed from forests, which increases the risk of fire."|https://kenyannews.co.ke/world-news/international/drought-also-at-a-neighbor-of-poland-two-more-weeks-without-water-and-damage-will-be-irreversible/
