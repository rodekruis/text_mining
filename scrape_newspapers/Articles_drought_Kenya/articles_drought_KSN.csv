Doctors around the country are mourning the death of Dr Adisa Lugaliki who succumbed to Covid-19. The news was shared by Dr Mercy Korir who described the deceased as a hardworking doctor who still had so much to offer.

“We have lost one of our own as a doctors’ fraternity to Covid-19. A young doctor with so much to offer,” tweeted Dr Korir.

The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union also sent a condolence message to the family of Dr Lugaliki, who served as an Obstetrician & Gynaecologist at The Nairobi South Hospital.

“We have lost a hard-working obstetrician/gynecologist, a mother, a friend and a colleague to the devastating effects of Covid-19.

“Our condolences to the family and friends of Dr. Doreen Lugaliki,” wrote KMPDU.

Online, many recalled their interactions with the deceased and lauded her for her professionalism and dedication to the medical profession.

Despite the risks involved, health workers have continued to give their all in the fight against Coronavirus, constantly asking the government to provide enough PPEs as they discharge their duties.

On Thursday, the Ministry of Health announced 447 new COVID-19 cases after testing 3,803 samples bringing the national tally to 8,975.

This is the largest number of confirmed cases in a day since the first case was reported in the country.

While speaking in Mombasa County, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said a total of 64 patients were discharged bringing the total number of recoveries to 2,657.

Four more people also succumbed to the disease bringing the death toll to 173.

Kagwe said since the cessation of movement was lifted three days ago, the government has been focusing on county preparedness to fight the curb of COVID-19.

He urged county governors who had not reached the maximum of 300 beds as proposed by the Ministry of health to do so.

The United States and Kenya began trade negotiations Wednesday, seeking to enter a free trade agreement. US Trade Representative Robert Lightheizer and Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for Trade Betty Maina kicked off the talks albeit virtually via video conference.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce lauded the progress, saying a deal could “strengthen and deepen our relationships with economies across the continent” of Africa.

Kenya is included in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which is set to expire in 2025. The U.S. Chamber says a Kenya free trade agreement will provide American businesses the certainty they need to continue investing in the growing market.

Agriculture goals for the U.S. include securing full market access for U.S. agricultural goods in Kenya by reducing or eliminating tariffs. Further, the U.S. seeks to eliminate practices that unfairly decrease U.S. market access opportunities or distort agricultural markets for the United States.

In 2018, U.S. total exports of agricultural products to Kenya totaled $37 million. Leading domestic export categories were $10 million of coarse grains, $6 million of wheat and $5 million of pulse crops.

The top U.S. goods exports to Kenya in 2019 were aircraft, plastics, machinery, and cereals, mainly wheat.

Here is exactly what the US seeks:

Introduction

On March 17, 2020, the Trump Administration notified Congress that the President intends to

negotiate a trade agreement with the Republic of Kenya, in accordance with section 105(a)(1)(A) of

the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (the Trade Priorities

and Accountability Act).

This notification was made following a February 6, 2020, meeting at the

White House between President Trump and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta where the two

presidents agreed to pursue negotiations on a trade agreement between the United States and Kenya.

In pursuing negotiations on a trade agreement with Kenya, we are responding to Congress’ support,

as expressed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), to negotiate reciprocal and

mutually beneficial trade agreements that serve the interests of both the United States and the

countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

Our vision is to conclude an agreement with Kenya that can serve

as a model for additional agreements in Africa, leading to a network of agreements that contribute to

Africa’s regional integration objectives. In addition, our goal is to conclude an agreement that builds

on the objectives of AGOA and will serve as an enduring foundation to expand U.S.-Africa trade

and investment across the continent.

We seek to support higher-paying jobs in the United States and grow the U.S. economy by

improving U.S. opportunities for trade and investment with Kenya. The current health crisis and

economic challenges posed by COVID-19 underscore our desire to strengthen our economic

relationship with Kenya and lay the foundations for stronger, more resilient economies to address the

current and future health crises. Our specific objectives for this negotiation will comply with the

specific objectives set forth by Congress in section 102 of the Trade Priorities and Accountability

Act.

In doing so, we aim to address both tariff and non-tariff barriers and to achieve fairer, more

balanced trade. We are committed to working closely with Congress, including on matters of scope,

and to following the requirements of the Trade Priorities and Accountability Act and the guidelines

issued pursuant to section 104(a)(3) of the Act. Further, we recognize that effective implementation

and enforcement of the commitments made by our trading partners under our trade agreements are

vital to the success of those agreements, and we will seek provisions that ensure effective

implementation and enforcement.

As a part of the process of formulating these objectives, on March 23, 2020, we solicited public

comments by Federal Register notice regarding objectives and positions for a U.S.-Kenya trade

agreement and received over 5,000 submissions.

We are committed to concluding these negotiations with timely and substantive results for U.S.

consumers, businesses, farmers, ranchers, and workers, consistent with U.S. priorities and

negotiating objectives established by Congress in statute. As part of this process, the Administration

will update these negotiating objectives in the future, consistent with section 105(a)(1)(D) of the

Trade Priorities and Accountability Act.

We look forward to continuing to work with Congress as

negotiations with Kenya begin, and we are committed to working with Congress closely and

transparently throughout the process.
