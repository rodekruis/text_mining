How Uhuru And Ruto Contributed To The Destruction Of Mau Forest, Drought Rages|27/02/2018|"Photo:US Ambassador Godec and his counterpart, Western envoys suppors Jubilee regime.

Via Cde D.

The Mau Conservation issue was bad politics then and those who pushed it should be reminded about it now.

Advisers of Raila Odinga are very learned people but where I never understand them is how they organize the PM’s ‘talking points’ diary.

Right now, in every church, in every rally, in every gathering; it should be our turn to REVISIT the Mau and environmental conservation generally.

Raila Odinga fought environmental degradation alone, facing up against the cheap politics of Mwai Kibaki succession.

It always amazes me that Mwai Kibaki today passes around as some water ambassador. Which water? Tap water?

At the height of environmental wars Raila was waging against Rift Valley and Central Kenya politicians who had then started caucusing together, Kibaki kept quiet. He shamelessly did!

By not boldly coming out as head of state, who had rigged himself in to take care of Kenya, he empowered his acolytes to damage Kenya’s nature.

He never joined the environmental conservation war. This should be clear. Kenyan children should grow knowing he never supported Environmental conservation. Selfish old Mzee didn’t!

As President he never supported PM Odinga, choosing to play cheap succession politics Ruto, Uhuru and their footsoldiers were then playing.

Mau Forest conservation had three components.

First was to stop logging immediately. Second was removal of people who had encroached the forest to pave way for a reforestation programme. Third was compensation for those evicted, who genuinely had claim to the forest, either through title deeds or cultural stakes.

Uhuru Kenyatta was then Finance Minister.

Cabinet would sit and allocate the money for resettlement. Same cabinet would give the start date for removal of those who had settled in the forest, Treasury having given the assurance that money for resettlement would be availed.

Uhuru and Ruto would then rush to Rift Valley and tell the people they had allocated billions for their resettlement, which they added should be done ‘humanely’.

Problem is: Treasury would deliberately refuse to release the monies, or delay the release. At the same time, Ministry of Internal Security would move with speed and destroy the houses and structures people lived in, claiming the order came from OPM.

As Treasury delayed releasing funds for compensation and resettlement; same Treasury would quickly allocate and release funds to Ministry of Special Programmes (then under Naomi Shabaan -KANU/PNU) to distribute to “those removed by Raila”, so as to “alleviate the suffering of those Raila is evicting from the Mau”.

This group was assisted by a totally partisan mainstream press that hid the details, played first and loose with the facts or just chose to disseminate what what the highest bidder wanted it to.

And when it comes to corrupting the press no one beats Uhuru and Ruto and government machinery!

Kenyans watched it unfold right in their faces. Kibaki kept quiet as these shenanigans played not just within the executive but also in parliament, where Rift Valley MPs used Prime Minister’s Question Time to make very wild public spectacle regarding the Mau.

What was a conservation issue became a hot political issue.

Raila lost it, and Kenya lost.

Today, let it be known Raila Odinga meant well for homeland, as he has always, even if he loses.

Hunger in Turkana: Rare photo of DP Ruto with CSs accused of looting 21billons for dams discusing drought|18/03/2019|"Hunger in Turkana: Rare photo of DP Ruto with CSs accused of looting 21billons for dams discusing drought

Deputy President William Ruto says the government is in control of the ongoing drought situation ravaging sections of the country, hence, there should be no cause for alarm.

Speaking in Nairobi at a media briefing, Ruto on Monday said the government has released Ksh.2 billion for the supply of food and water to about 1.1 million Kenyans affected by the ongoing drought situation.

“This morning, the government of Kenya has approved Ksh. 2 billion to be spent within this week in water tracking, making sure that boreholes and waterpumps are working,” said Ruto.

The deputy president maintained that there is enough food in the country to feed the Kenyans affected by hunger, adding that “this year’s situation is better.”

“It is important to state that the situation we have this year is better than the situation we had last year and the year before,” said the DP.

“There should be no cause for alarm at the moment, the government has put in place both at the county and national level interventions to manage the current drought. We will work together with partners such as the United Nations agency and all other friendly institutions to ensure we don’t have any casualties as a result of this drought.”"|https://www.kenya-today.com/news/hunger-in-turkana-rare-photo-of-dp-ruto-with-css-accused-of-looting-21billons-for-dams-discusing-drought
“We are Happy with the DROUGHT that Led to Hunger and Starvation allowing us to Import Sugar and Maize”-Hon Duale|19/05/2017|"Aden Duale enjoying

“We are very very HAPPY because of the DROUGHT that faced our country over the last four months, that made our farmers not to GROW FOOD that created an INFLATION that has never been seen in our country over the last four years.”



-Duale: Jubilee Majority Leader & Uhuru surrogate, 5/18/17.

It is shocking what makes jubilee “HAPPY”!!!

As some Kenyans laid to rest their relatives who died because of drought, Duale and Jubilee were very very happy.

As Kenyans cried of their lost investment due to the death of their animals as a result of the drought, Jubilee and Duale were very very happy.

As Kenyans agonized over the high prices of food, wondering how they would feed their families, and scared of facing their children to tell them that this month you will be forced to drink black tea without sugar and milk because Daddy could not afford sugar and milk, Jubilee and Duale were very very Happy.

My heart is shaken and sunken this evening to learn that Duale and his party, Jubilee were actually very very HAPPY as Kenyans were distraught and crying.

It is this level of disconnect, elitism, and arrogance with the leaders of our country that is our undoing. When a key presidential surrogate can publicly admit that they are thrilled by the suffering of Kenyans, friends, I have no words to describe my anger.

Now I understand why Duale sees nothing wrong with spending Kshs 5 billions to import metal containers while Kenyans are dying in hospitals because of lack of medicine.



Now I understand why painting statehouse for Kshs 12 billions is a priority but not fixing the living quarters of our policemen and policewomen, who risk their lives everyday in service to nation, but are forced to share a single room without bedding or proper furniture.

Now I understand why the government would rather not negotiate with doctors and put in place a return to work formula so that Kenyans can be treated.

Now I understand why Jubilee would rather spend Kshs 4.5 Billions on Amina project rather than buy cancer machines for Kenyatta National Hospital.

It is because the suffering of KENYANS makes JUBILEE and DUALE VERY HAPPY.

How on earth can a human being celebrate the suffering of another? and how sad can it get when that very person celebrating the suffering of Kenyans is a person paid by the taxes Kenyans pay?

I plead with you honorable Kenyans, whose suffering makes the likes of Duale very very happy to rise up on 8/8/17 and show the arrogant and his team, that it is your taxes that pay his bills. We must vote out JUBILEE and its roots.

I am deeply disappointed……………

Prof Wangare Mathai Speaks from The Grave, Curses Uhuru Regime over Raging Drought|27/02/2018|"By Silas N

As a generation, Wangari Mathai will never be proud of us. She rolling furiously on her grave for the insult.

We are going to let SGR spoil the beautiful park, one of the few green spots remaining in the city.

When I was young and stupid, used to believe that the park is a useless inconvenience. Then I met this guy, used to be in Chiromo while I was in Main Campus and he explained to me about the original zoning of the city, why from Makaburini, from Bunyala Road, all the way to Chiromo we have the parks (Railway Golf Club, Uhuru Park, Central Park, and the University of Nairobi’s mini forests as you head up to Chiromo). To give the city, some breathing space. And absorb the smoke from your cheap and dangerous imports from Japan that has made the city the most polluted in Africa.

Now I know better. I know the value of trees and I get worried anytime I see a timber yard or the huge charcoal warehouses like the one in South B. I cringe (genuinely when I see a jiko being washwad in my home).

Nairobi National Parks is worth protecting and much more precious than the SGR or whatever tasteless apartments they want to erect in the park.

I hate it that for my daughter to play, I have to fork out at least Sh 1,500 in most malls, when a simple neighbourhood park should be some of the fewer guarantees as a tax-payer who lives in the city.

A while ago, while on a tour with KTB, we were taken to some coffee farm in Kiambu. The man guiding through the farm said something that really bothered me. He said, one coffee tree is worthy much more than an apartment.

“An apartment only employs one person once it has been erected , the caretaker, but this coffee tree can employee many more people for many more years.”

He went on to decry on how wrong it was for Kiambu County to take to Real Estate at the expense of farming because it is one of the most arable parts of the country.

The upshot: we have Kenya, a country with more agriculturally productive land than Dubai, receiving a food donation from a desert.

But as I keep saying, Africa we are a cursed country. Badly so."|https://www.kenya-today.com/opinion/prof-wangare-mathai-speaks-grave-curses-uhuru-regime-raging-drought

ODM STATEMENT on DROUGHT Situation in the Country|20/10/2016|"ODM STATEMENT ON DROUGHT SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY:

In August, 2009 the last time a drought and famine of the magnitude building up in Kenya hit the nation, the then infant Grand Coalition Government launched an ambitious emergency response programme to provide rapid delivery of food, water and medicine to over 10 million Kenyans in arid and semi arid areas of most affected by the prolonged drought.

Prime Minister Raila Odinga, then in charge of coordination of government, together with President Mwai Kibaki were able to put together a response programme to address serious challenges on the government coping mechanisms posed by the unprecedented deterioration of food security. At that time, the rains had failed for the fourth consecutive year.

Kibaki and Raila were able to roll out a multi-faceted rapid response programme that was simultaneously launched in eleven arid and semi arid districts at Loiyangalani trading centre in Marsabit North District.

At the time, Kenyans agreed that it was the first time they witnessed a government go all out in the interest of citizens. Such a response had never been seen before.

About six years later, a government that came to power boasting the youthfulness of its leadership and digital capabilities appears to be caught napping by a drought that has barely lasted six months. The government is also distracted by scandals and wrong priorities and paralyzed by ineptitude while citizens suffer and die.

Despite four years of its key members led by President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto running around the country making all sorts of promises; from livestock insurance to crop insurance and massive irrigation, Jubilee has been caught asleep.

As pastoralists loose their livestock in record numbers while millions in arid and semi arid lands face starvation, Jubilee is still making promises and addressing State House Summits on how to address the problem which is rapidly spreading.

ODM is sick and tired of this inaction. We are disturbed at this apparent lack of action plan and the all talk and promise and no action. Consequently:

1. ODM demands that the President immediately unleashes State resources and put them at the disposal and service of suffering Kenyans in all parts of the country.

2. ODM demands the immediate deployment of all relevant personnel, including the disciplined forces in the distribution of food, water and hay to all affected communities.

3. We demand the immediate release of money to buy livestock affected by drought to save the pastoralists from the losses in line with the trend the Grand Coalition Government initiated.

4. We demand that the President immediately flags off livestock off-take by Kenya meat commission and other private sector agencies like Farmers’ Choice and Quality Meat Packers to save our people.

5. We demand the immediate launch of massive borehole drilling and distribution of food and water to all affected families across the country.

6. ODM also demands that the government ends with immediate effect the hostilities in the Kerio Valley pitting the Pokot against the Marakwet, which have led to loss of hundreds of lives and left many children orphaned and schools closed while the government goes about daily routines as if nothing is happening. The lives of the Pokot and the Marakwet are as precious as that of any other Kenyan.

We are considering other measures of legal and political nature to ensure the people in the affected areas get what is due to them if the government does not immediately swing into action.

2. Hon Junet Mohammed, MP, Suna East/ Director of Campaigns ODM.

DP Ruto humiliated as Statehouse directs CS Matiangi to take charge of Drought and relief|18/03/2019|"Hunger in Turkana: Rare photo of DP Ruto with CSs accused of looting 21billons meant for dams in North Rift. They were discussing the raging drought and famine in North Rift

Interior CS Dr Fred Matiangi has been asked by the president take charge of famine and drought response team and ensure government manages the situation in the country. He is to direct the government machinery and also convene voluntary NGOs, corporate sector and other agencies who will be involved the exercising of contributing and distributing aid to affected communities in Turkana, Baringo, Moyale, Marsabit, Makueni and Tana River (the worst hit areas).

The move is meant to streamline the operations and keep away ‘thieves’- reads in part a brief advisory from Statehouse to the Politiburo members.

Earlier today DP Ruto chaired a government response team that brought together cabinet secretaries for Treasury, Devolution, Water and Agriculture that was convened to coordinate the government response.

Well, an informal internal communication indicates CS Matiangi will take over and DP Ruto will be left to continue with his hate campaigns against Raila, Uhuru and DCI for vowing to wage war against those who looted 21billion meant for crucial dams in North Rift where the drought has hit most.

The DP told media that the government is in control of the ongoing drought situation ravaging sections of the country, hence, there should be no cause for alarm.

BREAKING: Raila Moves to SAVE Kenyans, OFFERS Uhuru Solutions to Address DROUGHT Emergency Interventions|12/02/2017|"PRESS STATEMEN BY RT. HON RAILA ODINGA: EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS TO SAVE LIVES:

Kenyans have today woken up to media reports that the prices of basics like maize flour, milk, tomatoes, cooking oil, onions and sukuma wiki have hit a new high last seen in the drought of 2009. This is in addition to the deepening drought that has claimed lives across the country while the spending power dwindles.

It is clear that the declaration of drought and famine emergency by the government will achieve little in the immediate future coming as it did against the background of internal contradictions within the government.

On February 6, 2017, only days before the President declared the famine a disaster and appealed for help, the Deputy President assured the country that there is enough food for everyone.

These internal contradictions indicate a lack of coherence and preparedness on the part of the government and point to the real possibility of a prolonged suffering of Kenyans.

For pastoralists, the policy of buying animals in desperation and slaughtering them will hurt economically in the long run. We must try to save these animals rather than slaughter them so as to ensure pastoralists do not start from zero and have a viable economy after this drought.



Towards this end, we urge the government to immediately embark on the following:

1. Open up all idle government lands that have pasture and allow pastoralists to move in and graze their cattle. Government agricultural extension officers should be on the ground to manage the movement of animals on these farms.

2. The government must appeal to our citizens with huge tracts of idle land with grass or hay and water to be their brothers’ keepers and allow herders to access those farms under the watch of agricultural officers to save livelihoods.

3. Negotiate with the big ranchers and pay them to allow pastoralists to seek pasture on their land. Government agricultural extension officers should also assist in this exercise.

4. Use government trucks particularly in the military to move animals from the fields of death to the government and private ranches.

5. Deploy military water bowsers to get water to the animal populations where water resources have dried up.

6. Move animal fodder like hay to the animals that are too weak to move or be moved.

For the rest of the population, the government must immediately undertake the following emergency interventions to alleviate suffering before the food aid comes:

1. The State must mop up all the food that some of our farmers are still holding on to in anticipation of higher prices. The National Cereals and Produce Board must be instructed to buy such produce at a minimum of Ksh 4000. This should yield reasonable amounts of food to be distributed immediately as relief.

2. Immediately set up emergency feeding and medical centres in the most afflicted areas to which Kenyans facing starvation should be moved into and catered for. It is not of much assistance to drop dry rations to people on the verge of death and ask them to prepare food. A lot of these Kenyans are too weak to even cook.

3. Forge a working partnerships with the civil society, community based organisations and non-governmental organisations. These organisations usually have faster response times than government bureaucracy and will save more people in dire situations than government administrators. Civil society organizations that deal with disaster also have better trained personnel to handles the most extreme of cases.

4. Immediately establish a record keeping system of pastoralists stocks and the animals they lose in the drought. Restocking these herds must be the first priority when the rains return. Drought relief must be about both the saving of lives and the saving of livelihoods.

In all these measures, the government would achieve more and relieve suffering faster by relying on the precision, discipline and efficiency of our military.
