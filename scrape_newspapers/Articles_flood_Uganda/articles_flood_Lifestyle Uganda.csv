The People Power and Member of Parliament of the Kamwokya-based Political Pressure Group Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu alias Bobi Wine donated 13.5m (thirteen million shillings) to floods victims, which recently cleared the Kasese district, leaving many homes in shock.

Kasese district has been hit by a fresh flood that killed five people of the same family yesterday morning in the Bukonso west constituency along the Uganda-DR Congo border.

Rwenzori East police Spokesperson, Vincent Twesige said the incident occurred Thursday morning. The dead included four women and 2 men.

The Nyamwamba River burst its banks earlier this month, displacing more than 120,000 people from the Bulembia Kilembe division and the Karusandara Sub County.

During the hand over of the cash donation to Hon. Winnie Kizza , the woman MP of Kasese, Robert Kyagulanyi said the donation has been made from supporters of the people power pressure group within and those in the diaspora.

Mr Kyagulanyi Ssentamu said, “We were able to raise and contribute thirteen million and five hundred thousand shillings (13,500,000 shs) to the cause.

After a successful concert online, President, Musician and Member of Parliament (MP) Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu alias Bobi Wine said he received many requests from people to pay for the event.

Robert Kyagulanyi thanked the Ugandan people for answering his call and contributing to helping the Kasese people, saying that this is a spirit that all Ugandans should always accept.

“I applaud all of you who answered our call and contributed to this noble cause of ours. We stand with you and pray for you, the people of Kasay,” Robert kyagulanyi posted on his Facebook page.

The donation was received by Winnie Kizza and promised to ensure that the money would reach its intended destination in Kasese, however, Winnie Kizza asked the government to come up with a lasting solution for the people.

President Museveni paid a visit to Kasese to see how much the floods had affected the area, and was in consultation with local leaders to find long-term solutions in Kasese.
