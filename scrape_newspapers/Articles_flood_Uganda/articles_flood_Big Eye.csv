If you live in a small space, everything has the potential to make a massive difference. And that’s the key idea behind this article. In this article, we’ll teach you tips and tricks that can help you make your small room look bigger by the application of just a few clever tips and tricks. Unfortunately, the small rooms can make the space look uncomfortable and confining. However, there are a few design concepts, which can fool the eye and make any space look more spacious than it already is. Furniture arrangements, color techniques, and smart lighting are just a few of the many topics that will be covered in this post. Hopefully, these ideas will be inspiring for you.

Use clever contrasts and light areas

It is a well-known fact that light colors have the potential to make space look brighter and bigger. Bright walls and light together act as reflective and make space feel more airy and open. This helps maximize the effect, which is created with the help of natural light. On the other hand, the dark colors absorb the light and make the room look smaller. To achieve an optimum effect, you should opt for softer hues like green, blue, and off-white. Also, remember that a brighter room will look more inviting and certainly bigger. Anusha, a hobbyist home decorator, who is a full-time assignment expert at TFTH,says that she just painted the moldings and the wall trims (blue) in a color lighter than the color of the walls (green), and now the room looks bigger because the wall seems farther apart from each other.

Lighting is your key to opening up any space

Rihanna, a college student who availed of statistics homework help by TAE, currently lives in a small rented apartment. She said she has added a bunch of lighting fixtures in her room, and that gives an illusion of it being bigger than normal. If you do not want to invest in lighting fixtures, let the natural light inside the room. You’ll be amazed at the kind of difference lighting can make for your room. When you have adequate access to the natural light, allowing it into the home via large windows will work as a connection between the room and the outdoors, thereby making space look bigger. You can either get sheer window covering or completely pull them back, to ensure that more light comes in. In case the view outside is not very pleasant, you can add some flowers or plants near the window. You can even use some lamps to brighten up space.

Cut out the clutter

You must keep your room organized and tidy. Harry, who is a homework help assistant with EssayWriter4U,says that he has a stack of books for his reference, which he rarely ever uses in his room, and that occupies a lot of space. He recently got rid of all of these books, and that made his room look more organized and tidy. Trust us when we say this, nothing else makes the room look more cramped and cluttered than having too much stuff. When things are arranged neatly, space looks more open and orderly. Always remember, a cluttered room is equivalent to a smaller room. Also, do not just cover all the walls with a lot of pictures and photographs. If you want the room to look bigger, just a large painting works better than multiple smaller paintings. If a lot is happening in the room, it can make it look crowded and busy. Now, when you are decorating a small room, try to create one focal point, one feature, or area that will bag all the attention. For instance, if it is the dining room, then this area will be the dining table. Now, you have to arrange the furniture in a manner that the focus is on this area. So, naturally, you have to ensure that the décor around is minimalist. Furthermore, you should try to keep the floor as clear as possible. This is certainly the most important tip to make the room look spacious. You can get rid of all the larger rugs to give an illusion of wider floor space.

Add mirrors in the room

Mirrors give an illusion of a bigger room. So, for the adequate effect, you can pick a focal point, and then position your mirror towards it. This will give an illusion of depth. Furthermore, the mirror reflects the artificial as well as the natural light. As a result, the room looks lighter and brighter during the day and the night. Mirrors tend to bounce the light into the room, and thus, make it look larger. Ayesha, who is a work from the home employee with TrumpLearning,says that since she spends a major part of her day in her room, she has placed the mirror right near the window, as it reflects the light of the sun and makes the room look more airy and fresh. You can also add a mirrored cabinet that’d make space look larger.

Legendary singer Jose Chameleone can’t cease his history of blowing-up fights in the music industry.

He has severely been reported reincarnating brawls with different individuals for years now.

Latest on the dark side of his docket is fabled music producer, Diggy Baur (Sabula Boss) who has accused the singer of beating him up and his young brother, a one Akram to injuries.

Producer Diggy Baur

According to the video that Baur has posted today morning on his social media, the scuffle started when his young brother rejected to have Chameleone record a song in the studio.

Baur also reveals how Chameleone’s young brother, Weasel Manizo tried to harmonize the situation that had gone rowdy but Chameleone resented grounding reasons of being a star.

Baur’s injury sustained

He further reveals how he has on various occasions produced songs for the singer at no cost but unfortunately, his sweat and love for Chameleone has been paid with pain.

The stammering-producer also says it has been Chameleone’s routine of coming to his studio, disrespect, and insult and endanger him or his fellow studio colleagues.

Producer Baur’s studio, Sabula Records

The Sabula Records CEO has banned the Lord Mayor to-be from his studio and vowed to school him of respecting other people’s efforts after messing up his life.

Producer Baur is famously named responsible for Jose Chameleone’s songs such as his latest Baliwa and Kiboko featuring Kalifah Aganaga.

Jose Chameleone

Its clearly noticed as a recommendable addiction for Chameleone and his brothers after his brother, Weasel Manizo was also reported last month to have vandalized young producer, Genius Goddy’s studio equipment.

However, Jose Chameleone is yet to issue his remarks regarding the allegations against him.

Sheila seems to be in control of the Uganda’s media at the moment with her one month old ‘Stop cyber bulling in Uganda’ campaign.

After her victory over Urban TV’s Tina Fierce whom she accused of using her ‘Scoop On Scoop’ show to throw malicious insults at her, Sheila has now turned guns at Nation Media’s Isaac Katende aka Kuku Wazabanga (Kasuku).

This follows Kasuku’s remarks on Sheila Gashumba’s ‘Stop Cyber Bullying in Uganda’ while appearing on NBS TV’s ‘Uncut Sabula’ show.

Kasuku

During the interview, Kasuku asserted that Sheila has no moral authority to run such a campaign having also been a culprit of social media bullying when she used her handles to insult, former NTV presenter, Robin Kisti.

Kasuku’s opinion didn’t sound pleasant to Sheila even for a blink of an eye as she immediately set a Facebook live video to drop her response on his claims.

In the video, Gashumba revealed how Kasuku should have been their (Sheila and Gods Plan) target to hunt-down in this campaign because of his continuous malicious criticism to musicians.

Sheila Gashumba

She also says that Kasuku is just being a hypocrite whom she once helped to have his first buffet at Kampala Serena Hotel.

Sheila has also shifted the war to Twitter as she continues to shower the ‘Talk and Talk’ show presenter with unbearable insults of his career.

“Age is just a number it has never meant Intelligence!! Kasuku you should be retired now allowing other young talented youth to have a chance to be on radio and tv than attacking public figures!! You should be on holiday right now!!” tweeted Sheila.

Surely Kasuku seems to have been a valuable item for Gashumba to ruin under this campaign as she has also onboarded boyfriend, Gods Plan in the war.

Gods plan indirectly thumbs Kasuku for having begged him Shs. 50K for transport.

Sheila Gashumba and boyfriend, Gods Plan

He also advises him to first pocket adequate evidence before giving opinions during discussions.

“I remember giving someone 50k outside guvnor for transport. Naye MUJOOGA

My advice to journalist or radio presenters is always investigate before opening your mouth to give an opinion. Your opinion has to be based on facts not because your friend told you his side,” tweeted Gods Plan.

However, Kasuku seems not over taken by the couple’s words as he buries hope of getting any reply from him.

“Afta alot of thought,am not going to get involved in a verbal exchange with Sheila Gashumba or the boyfie.This has become their way of life lately. They can mek all the noise in the world and enjoy retweets but not today… Time will tell. Gudnite,” wrote Kasuku.

The campaign was initiated by Sheila and boyfriend, Gods Plan last month to curb the thrilling social media harassment in Uganda, marking celebrities as the best victims.

Having landed Kasuku, one of the most celebrated critic media personalities in the country on her docket, the public highly anticipates the fresh war to escalate beyond this point.

Miss Zimbabwe stripped of title after naked photos of her flood WhatsApp|12/06/2015|"The current Miss Zimbabwe has been stripped of her title on the grounds of ‘immoral behaviour’ after naked photographs of her appeared on the instant messaging service WhatsApp.

Emily Kachote, 25, broke rules that insist beauty queens must never pose nude, the pageant board said in a statement amid claims the model’s former lover deliberately leaked the images.

In a bizarre twist, Miss Kachote’s predecessor Thabiso Phiri, 22, was also stripped of the Miss Zimbabwe title – which automatically enters the winner into the Miss World competition – after nude photographs she had sent to her boyfriend were leaked and went viral.

In a statement, the Miss Zimbabwe pageant board said Miss Kachote ‘violated the rules and regulations governing the pageant’, referring to nude images of that appeared on Whatsapp, according to a local tabloid newspaper.

‘Winners of the Miss World Zimbabwe beauty pageant whether a title holder or runner-up must not have posed nude professionally or socially in all forms of media,’ the organisers said.

‘Being in a relationship, sexual advances to anyone and any behaviour categorised as immoral by the Miss Zimbabwe Trust is grounds for instant disqualification and dethronement,’ they added.

When rumours of the scandal broke last month, Miss Kachote was quoted by New Zimbabwe as saying: ‘I was hoping the pictures would have been deleted by now since it happened a long time ago and I last spoke to the guy a year ago and I no longer have anything to do with [him]…’

‘I have always suspected that those pictures would circulate, but it happened a long time ago, and I believe my past does not determine where I am going,’ she reportedly added.

According to News 24, the disqualification will be welcomed in some quarters by Miss Zimbabwe watchers who branded the model ‘too ugly’ to hold the title.

Miss Kachote, a psychology graduate turned financial advisor, was crowned Miss World Zimbabwe in April, beating 15 other models.

The organisers of the contest said Kachote’s pictures were leaked shortly after she confessed to having once posed nude.

The board said Kachote will be replaced by runner-up Grace Mutambu, who will represent Zimbabwe at the Miss World pageant in Sanya, China in December.

Last year’s Miss Zimbabwe Miss Phiri was also caught up in a nude photo scandal and was forced to resign.

And in 2003 another Miss Zimbabwe, Linda Van Beek, was also forced to step down ahead of scehdule when she fell pregnant.

Miss Zimbabwe rules stipulate that entrants must not be expecting at the time of their election, nor can they fall pregnant during their ‘reign’.

Nicole Scherzinger in tears as ex Lewis Hamilton continues to party.|25/02/2015|"Nicole Scherzinger has been left in “floods of tears” after seeing her ex Lewis Hamilton partying with other women, it has been claimed.

The singer split from her F1 ace partner last month, but is said to be upset after seeing him appear to move on quickly.

Lewis was seen out with a mystery blonde just a week later in New York , and has since posed with supermodel Naomi Campbell – who he was romantically linked with back in 2007.

“Nicole has been in pieces about the split,” a source told New! magazine. “Lewis promised her he’d respect her and not go rushing into another relationship or even hang out with other girls.

“So she was devastated when she saw him partying in New York. She’s been in floods of tears most of the time.”

The star even reportedly sent a text to her ex, asking him to stop. But according to New! Lewis simply replied that he was “letting his hair down”, and they have been in contact ever since.

Lewis was previously romantically linked to Naomi Campbell in 2007, shortly after he met Nicole, but they always insisted they were just friends.

In fact, he even captioned his recent snap: “Selfie with my big sis.”

The supermodel has also been spotted out with them as a couple during their relationship.

The source added: “Lewis feels he should be able to have friendships with other women without feeling he constantly has to justify himself to her.”

A rep for Lewis confirmed to New! that the F1 star is “definitely not romantically linked to anyone”.
