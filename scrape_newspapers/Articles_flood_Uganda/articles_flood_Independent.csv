COVER STORY: Lake Victoria floods|24/05/2020|"What living in this historic moment means



Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | On May 20 there was heated debate about what should be done about thousands of people displaced or drowned and businesses and livelihoods destroyed by flooding around Lake Victoria.

Earlier, the Minister of State for Environment, Beatrice Anywar, had in April given the victims seven-days to leave or be forced out. She claimed they were illegally occupying wetlands and protected zones on the shores.

But MPs who know these areas, such as Janepher Engunyu (Buvuma Woman) informed Anywar that the water levels have gone beyond the 200 meters lake perimeter buffer zone set by National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA).

Find ways of helping the affected people instead of forcefully evacuating them, the MPs told the government.

Homes, businesses, and government fisheries and marine transport infrastructure have been inundated by the flood. The government is battling to save the three hydropower dams on the Nile River and jinja; the Kiira, Nalubaale, and Bujagali which produce most of the country‚Äôs electricity.

They have opened more sleuth gates to release and unprecedented 3000 cubic meters of water per second downstream. But that threatens more flooding downstream on the banks of River Nile and shores of Lakes Kyoga and Albert. Government engineers have also been battling to remove floating island debris from generators. The situation is worsened as most of the country is witnessing heavy rains and floods are erupting almost everywhere.

Ferry services between the mainland and lake islands have been suspended since docking ports got submerged and operators fear to hit stones and damage vessels as the move closure to the receding shores. The new Kampala-Entebbe Expressway is under threat.

A Shs2.8 billion government fish handling plant at Bugoto Fish Landing Site in Mayuge District has been destroyed.

Luxury hotels like the Lake Victoria Serena Golf Course, the Country Lake Resort Garuga, and the Marriot Protea in the Entebbe area and Speke Resort Munyonyo in Kampala are under water, as rains pound the Lake Victoria basin.

The question on most people‚Äôs minds when they see images of flooded homes and businesses on the shores of Lake Victoria is whether the beaches, landing sites, and some islands they have known all their life will resurface.

When he was asked the question by journalist, the manager of one of the top beach resorts in Uganda, the Spenah Beach in Entebbe, Christopher Ahimbisibwe, was philosophical.

‚ÄúI can no longer boast of having a sand beach,‚Äù he said, according to a report in Daily Monitor.

Previously raised land at the beach, including a watchtower for monitoring swimmers was at the time reported to be submerged about seven metres into the lake.

Other areas, such as Miami Beach in Port Bell and KK Beach in the Ggaba area of Kampala have been completely submerged as the lake shore has shifted about 35 metres beyond where it used to stop previously.

Many of these businesses and government installations were located outside the 200 perimeter buffer zone recommended by the government. Their destruction raises tough questions about the level of government planning. If the 200 meter perimeter buffer zone recommended by the government is not safe, what is safe? Suppose businesses move farther away from the expanded lake shore, what happens when the lake shore eventually recedes?"|https://www.independent.co.ug/cover-story-lake-victoria-floods/
Tororo flood victims urged to go home ‚Äì three months later|05/07/2020|"Tororo, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Floods victims in Tororo district are living under deplorable conditions.

The affected people from over 200 households were displaced by floods triggered by heavy rains that pounded Tororo district in March this year and pitched camp at Fungwe primary school where they have spent the last three month.

Mothers sleep on mats with their children while men sleep on desks in classrooms. The flood victims are also struggling to find what to eat as government has not extended to them any form of relief support.

They also lack access to clean safe drinking water and face insecurity at the school since there is no guard. Some of the flood victims told our reporter that they are currently dependent on well-wishers in the neighborhood and donations from local politicians.

Tororo Chief Administrative Officer, Dunstan Balaba, however says it is high time the victims return to their respective homes and start a new life as they wait for government intervention.

The West Budama Member of Parliament, Jacob Oboth Oboth has appealed to government to consider providing farm inputs and roofing materials to the affected people to start a new life.

The Camp Chairperson, Jowali Wabire says that they are faced with numerous challenges ranging from food shortage to lack of mosquito nets and increasing cases of rape and defilement.

He says much as they are facing the challenges, the affected persons have no intentions of going back to villages they once called home and now want government to find them an alternative space to stay as they fear that they may be displaced again.

Bena Oketcho, the Yolwe Sub county LC III Chairperson, says it is risky for the victims to get back to their homes since most of their houses have collapsed. He says there is need for the flood victims to relocate from the school premises since children may return anytime.

Oketcho says there is need for government to start thinking of resettling the flood victims in a better place.

Kayunga leaders seek help to rescue residents in flooded areas|22/06/2020|"Kayunga, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Kayunga district authorities are seeking government intervention to relocate over 4,000 people from Kawongo landing site in Ggaliraya Sub County. The area has been cut off by flooding water from River Ssezibwa.

The landing site is currently congested with people who have been displaced from the shoreline of Lake Kyoga. Fred Ssembajwe, one of the affected residents says he is dismayed by the government‚Äôs failure to relocate them despite persistent pleas for help. Ssembajwe says they are stuck with nowhere to go, and no one to help.

Yusufu Kisigula, another resident says that although they had expected the district to come to their rescue, by relocating them to a secure place, nothing is forthcoming.

Kayunga District Chairperson Tom Sserwanga says that the district cannot independently deal with the situation. He says that the water first flooded the road before it strayed into gardens and submerged the entire island. Sserwanga says that although the district provided a boat to help some residents to move from the flooded area, a number of them have nowhere to go.

‚ÄúThe district is trying to identify space where some of the residents can be relocated to but still we lack materials to set up shelters for them. They will need feeding because all their gardens were destroyed by floods. We are still appealing to the Office of the Prime Minister to come to our rescue,‚Äù Sserwanga said.

The Uganda National Roads Authority manager in charge of Buganda region, Eng. Jimmy Adweke visited the area to assess the situation on the ground. He, however, said it would be hard to rehabilitate the flooded section before the water dries up, yet, it cannot be diverted.

Ggaliraya Sub County Chairperson Jamada Musana says the area is now a no go zone for motorists. He explains that whenever there are any deliveries they are offloaded and loaded on the boats.

Bundibugyo flood victims cry out for relief items|15/05/2020|"Bundibugyo, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | More than 800 families in Busaru sub-county Bundibugyo District are yet to receive relief aid after they were displaced by floods last week. The floods hit the district after River Lamia burst its banks.

The residents lost several gardens of sweet potatoes, beans and maize

Grace Atimango, a mother of four says they are worried about disease outbreaks due to lack of safe water. She explains that all the water sources in the area were destroyed by the floods.

Atimango wants the government to immediately come in and provide residents with safer water for use.

Margaret Mughasoki a mother of six says that she lost household properties. She says that due to lack of relief aid, she has resorted to sleeping on people‚Äôs verandas.

Mashasoki whose property was destroyed, questions why the government has remained so reluctant to come to their rescue.

Isaya Friday Kakwanga, the Mayor Busunga town council, says several people who were displaced by the floods are now being accommodated by relatives in town.

He says this is only increasing pressure on already financially stretched families during the lock-down.

Bundibugyo Resident District Commissioner ‚Äì RDC Grace Kakwenza Asiimwe says that that the central government will soon extend relief aid to the affected people.

However, she says the district has limited resources.

Sand miners abandon Lwera wetland over flooding|15/05/2020|"Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Sand miners in Lwera wetland along the Kampala-Masaka highway have halted operations following heavy flooding in the area.

The 20-kilometre stretch of the wetland extending from Mpigi to Kalungu districts which also acts at the Lake Victoria catchment area has been heavily degraded by commercial sand mining activities.

Robert Mukasa, one of the Excavator operators at H$Q Enterprises Limited one of the companies operating in Lwera says that they suspended operations until the water levels reduce.

He explains that the high volume of water due to the heavy seasonal rains and Lake Victoria overflows has affected the movement of their machines to the site.

Francis Ssegawa, one of the small-scale sand miners says that the situation has made it difficult for many people to continue operating.

He says that out of the nine mining companies operating in Lwera, only three use highly sophisticated equipment and are still operational.

Ssegawa has however blamed the situation to use of the heavy machinery which he says were deliberately used to tamper with the water drainage systems which has led to irreversible effects.

The floods at Lwera come after several warning from environmentalists about the dangers of degrading the wetland, that may include failing or submerging of part of the Kampala-Masaka highway.

Famine looms in Kasese as crops dry due to floodwater silt deposits|10/06/2020|"Kasese, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Hundreds of farmers in the sub-counties of Karusandara, Maliba, Kanyangeya and Mubuku in Kasese district are facing a famine threat after their plantations began drying up as a result of silt deposits left by recent floodwaters.

The floods followed a heavy downpour that pounded the district last month when River Nyamwamba overflew at Bunyandiko in Kilembe sub county submerging the low-lying areas of the district. The heavy rains also submerged acres of gardens leaving behind silt composites as deep as 5 feet. Some farmers are worried that mineral components carried by waters from the mountains including copper and zinc will be harmful to their crops.

In Karusandara sub-county, banana plantations have started drying up while farmers in Maliba have abandoned cultivating in the meantime after failing to break through the silt. This they say has already exposed the disaster-stricken sub-county to a threat of famine.

Emmanuel Katuramu, a farmer and chairman of Kihondo, Scheme Ward in Nyamwamba division says over 100 families in the area are now at risk of famine as most crops especially banana plantations are dying. Katuramu adds that some perennial crops like groundnuts and beans had already been covered by the silt while others had been washed away by floods.

Katuramu called for immediate intervention from the government to save the area which depends entirely on agriculture for its survival.

Nelson Musabe, another farmer from Mubuku says his four acres banana plantation is turning yellow while efforts to open the silt have failed due to its hardness.

Gloria Mbabazi, another farmer who had initially lost her tomato and ground nuts gardens to the floods, now wants the government to come in and help farmers save their crops before they completely dry up.

The other group that is affected are the brick makers. Katuramu, a bricklayer from Kanyangeya says he has been depending on his casual work for his livelihood but with the silt across his homestead, his job is no more.

Santos Tumwine, the Karusandara area councillor says the threat posed on agriculture by siltation cannot be overstated. He confirmed that if let to go on unabated, the threat of siltation was likely to derail efforts by the district to engage in more agricultural activities.

Kasese Senior Agriculture Officer Johnson Sabuni Mwesige says the plantations are drying up due to water logging under the silt and limited air circulation. He acknowledges that crops such as banana and coffee will have to dry since they require free drainage soils but advises farmers to plant away from river banks and flood-prone areas.

With no immediate plan of intervention, Mwesige adds that it‚Äôs unfortunate that farmers will have to lose their crops. Questioned on reports of minerals from the mountains that can affect the crops, he says the toxic effects can only be ascertained after some time.

Flood victims in Kwania district demand for relief|05/06/2020|"Kwania, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | More than 500 residents of Nambieso and Chawente sub county in Kwania district who were displaced by floods are starving.

The residents who live along the shores of Lake Kwania have remained homeless and their gardens of crops submerged after the Lake burst its banks last month.

Jimmy Emmanuel Okello Ecun, the Nambieso sub county male councillor expressed fear that the affected communities will suffer severe famine since they mainly depend on subsistence farming.

He argued that it is the responsibility of the government to protect its citizen and their property.

Okello wants the government to provide relief food and compensate the flood-affected persons for losses incurred as well as temporal structures for their shelter.

Nelson Obwol, a resident of Lwala village in Anwangi parish, Nambieso sub county said water has now submerged his four acres of sunflower and soya.

Another resident, Sharon Odur, a resident of Ilera village Aornga parish in Nambieso sub county says water is rapidly flowing out of the lake daily forcing people to abandon their homes and sleeping under trees.

Basil Anthony Okello Onac, the Kwania LCV chairperson says that he observed that as the district, there is an urgent need to support the Disaster Management Committee to respond to emergencies in the district.

Seasonal winds intensify flooding on landing sites in Kalungu|07/06/2020|"Kalungu, Uganda| AFP | THE INDEPENDENT | Communities at various landing sites in Kalungu district are still battling the consequences of heavy overflows from the Lake Victoria waters, despite a reduction in rainfall.

Ronald Ssemanda, the Chairperson of Kamuwunga Landing Site in Lukaya Town Council in Kalungu district says the situation has been worsened by strong seasonal winds that are splashing water far beyond the 200 meters of the buffer zones.

He says that while they were hopeful that the reduction in rains would clear their areas of the distressing floods, the heavy waves on the lake blown by seasonal strong winds have instead wrecked more havoc in the area.

Ssemanda explains that the lake waters have created unusual inland channels that drain into people‚Äôs homes and plantations, some which had not been affected in the rainy season.Some of the affected areas include a government school, a community playground, a mosque, a Pentecostal church and several houses that are situated several meters away from the lakes shoreline.

Francis Ssaaka, a caretaker of Kamuwunga Primary School says in a rather unusual scenario the entire school compound is flooded with water flowing directly from the lake, which threatens the strength of the classrooms.

He explains that the lake has lately accumulated high volumes of water which by a slight push of the seasonal winds leads to unusual overflows towards all the low-lying areas of the mainland.

Kalingu Woman Member of Parliament Aisha Ssekindi says they are worried about the fate of the learners who might not be able to use the facility if the government opens schools to resume studies.

She however says they are lobbying the government to allocate them money to relocate the school to another elevated site that may not be affected by similar eventualities.

Meanwhile, the National Environment Management Authority-NEMA is working out plans to evict all people that encroached on wetlands and along Lake Shores and River Banks as a remedy for environmental destruction.

OPM sends relief supplies to Kasese flood victims|10/05/2020|"Kasese, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Kasese District has received relief items from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) for distribution to persons affected by floods that devastated the area during the week.

More than 120,000 people mainly from Karusandara sub-county and Bulembia-Kilembe Division were displaced and their crop gardens washed away when River Nyamwamba burst its banks on Thursday Morning. Additional havoc was caused by overflows from River Nyamughasana, Mubuku, and Lhubiriha.

Floods cut off roads in greater Luweero|08/05/2020|"Luweero, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Several feeder roads are impassable after heavy rains washed away culverts leaving farmers stranded in Greater Luweero districts.

The major affected roads are Katuba-Moone, Nabutaka ‚ÄìNtuuti and Nabutaka -Mukanyikamondo which connects Nakasongola to Luweero district.

Other roads are Nalongo-Kakabala ‚ÄìNamatogonya, Nakafumu-Mpigi, Bulawula-Kanyogogga, Nandere-Butiki and Kasana-Lugogo which connects Luweero to Nakaseke district.

The major affected sections of the roads are those connected by wetlands or swamps. The culverts installed to enable smooth water flow are blocked, curved in and others washed away making the spots impassable.

Ibrah Lubega a motorist at KALUDO Stage in Luweero town council says that a week ago a culvert along Kasana-Lugogo road was washed away paralyzing transport between Luweero and Nakaseke districts.

Lubega adds that the local youths erected a temporary bridge to enable cyclists and pedestrians to pass through at cost of 500-1000 shillings per trip.

Robert Ssekyanzi a resident of Nakaseta village says that several residents have abandoned the road and opted for other longer routes something that has made transport costly.

Esther Nakivumbi another resident of Namatogonya village says that the breakdown of culverts along Nabutaka ‚ÄìMunyikamondo road has left many farmers stuck with produce.

Nakivumbi adds that the impassable roads have affected the transport of farm produce that include pineapples, coffee and bananas leaving them counting losses.

She adds that other traders who were buying charcoal from the area have abandoned the route.

The residents have asked both Nakasongola and Luweero Districts to replace the culverts to restore traffic flow.

Ibrah Muwonge the Luweero district councillor for Butuntumula sub-county blames investors for degrading wetlands in the area something that has affected water flow leading to floods in the roads.

Muwonge wants the National Environment Management Authority-NEMA to evict investors from the wetland if roads are to be restored.

Ronald Ndawula the LCV Chairperson of Luweero District says that culverts at Lumansi wetland which were submerged by water have been replaced and traffic flow is now normal.

Ndawula, however, explained that works at Lugogo and Nabutaka swamps will be worked after water levels decrease.

He added that the district has no money to repair other roads over lack of funds.

Luweero district has a total road network of 413 .1 kilometres which are supposed to be maintained both routinely and periodically.

Luweero budgeted for 1.4 billion shillings to cater for roads and engineering department.

In Nakasongola, Sam Kigula the LC 5 Chairman says that they have tried to work on the affected spots but the murram soils and culverts were again washed away by floods.

Kigula adds that they need over 300 million shillings to fix the affected roads which are currently unavailable and asked residents to remain calm until they raise needed resources.

Nakasongola budgeted for 1.7 billion shillings for roads and engineering department in 2019/2020.

Second wave of floods ruins two villages in Kasese|11/05/2020|"Kasese, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | A second wave of floods has washed away a huge part of Kilembe Mines Hospital and severely destroyed two villages in Kasese district as River Nyamwamba and several other rivers burst their banks on Sunday.

The two villages of Kanyaruboga and Bulembia in Kilembe have been ruined with buildings carried away by floods. The land is now filled with heavy boulders.

The incident comes just three days after heavy floods from the same river left hundreds of residents homeless and destroyed properties and facilities including Kilembe mines hospital.

Brigadier Stephen Oluka, who is leading the National Emergency Coordination department in the Office of the Prime Minister described the situation as ‚Äúdevastating‚Äù. Brig. Oluka says they are finding challenges in resettling those who are still trapped in the mountains and accessing health services.

Oluka adds that they will survey the areas to establish persons who are still leaving in flood prone areas for resettlement.

Kilembe Mines Hospital administrator Onesmus Kibaya says that a number of structures that had been spared by the Thursday floods have been brought down. Kibaya says the hospital is ideally no more.

Geoffrey Kabyanga Baluku says there is nothing to rehabilitate in the two villages that have been damaged but they have resolved to force all persons in the flood prone areas to vacate as more rains are still expected.

Pastor Joseph Wafula, a resident of Kilembe says the second wave of floods was worsened by the boulders that have blocked the main river course. He says most of the people in the area have been left with nothing to eat and no shelter. He wants government to desilt the river as soon as possible.

Over 120,000 people are displaced and have sought shelter in churches, sub county head quarters and others are hosted by relatives and friends.

Misinformation flood hampers fight for virus vaccine in Africa|07/05/2020|"Dakar, Senegal | AFP | The task of introducing a vaccine for the coronavirus faces an uphill struggle in Africa, where a flood of online misinformation is feeding on mistrust of Western medical research.

Across the continent, Facebook, WhatsApp and other platforms have been swamped by messaging that characterises vaccine research as harmful or even part of a plot to kill black people.

The world‚Äôs poorest continent ‚Äî and the most vulnerable to the disease, given its poor health infrastructure ‚Äî Africa has recorded more than 48,000 COVID-19 cases, 1,900 of which have been fatal, according to an AFP tally as of Wednesday.

The toll is below that of other continents, although the true figure may be considerably higher, given the lack of access to testing.

The absence of a cure has sparked a flurry of claims for purported remedies.

They range from consuming onions and ginger and drinking one‚Äôs urine to a herbal formula touted by Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina ‚Äî assertions that fly in the face of stern scientific warnings.

But it is the quest for a vaccine that has sparked particularly toxic disinformation, an investigation by AFP Fact Check has found.

In Senegal, a rumour that seven children died after being given a COVID-19 vaccine was shared thousands of times in Facebook posts in English and French.

In a video showing a crowd gathered in a Dakar street near a parked police car, a female voiceover presents the footage like a news report, explaining that the children ‚Äúdropped dead‚Äù after receiving the vaccine.

AFP found that the disturbance was in fact triggered when locals mistook a door-to-door cosmetics salesman for a health ministry worker. The government said that no children have died from a coronavirus vaccine.

Another post shared on Facebook and Twitter refers to a US government experiment that started in the 1930s and saw health workers withhold treatment from black men with syphilis to study the disease.

In 40 years, 28 of the test subjects died of syphilis and another 100 died of complications.

‚ÄúUS government offers free healthcare to southern rural blacks. Intentionally injects them with syphilis. Still want a corona vaccine?‚Äù the post reads, next to a photograph of black men in flat caps and dungarees waiting to be seen by white health workers.

And in another post widely shared around Africa, an illustration shows a black woman brandishing a machete towards a white doctor performing an injection.

‚Äì Long history of mistrust ‚Äì

Experts point to entrenched suspicions in Africa that the continent‚Äôs role is to be a test bench for novel drugs.

‚ÄúThere is a long history of mistrust,‚Äù Keymanthri Moodley, director of the Centre for Medical Ethics and Law at South Africa‚Äôs Stellenbosch University, told AFP.

This explains why comments made last month by two French researchers had an outsized impact south of the Sahara, Moodley said.

On television, the pair discussed the benefits of holding drug trials in Africa.

Jean-Paul Mira, head of intensive care at the Cochin hospital in Paris, suggested testing a vaccine in Africa ‚Äúwhere there are no masks, no treatment, no intensive care, rather as was done with certain studies on AIDS, where things are tested on prostitutes because it‚Äôs known that they are highly exposed‚Äù.

Vaccines are routinely tested in Africa and scientists point out that testing in a particular location can often provide key insights into how a drug works there.

The pair later apologised for any offence ‚Äî but this did little to calm allegations that Africans were being manipulated or even used as guinea pigs.

‚ÄúIt is as if we were back in the colonial era,‚Äù Kenya‚Äôs former justice minister Martha Karua told AFP. ‚ÄúI personally think it is racist and condescending.‚Äù

The storm unleashed a tsunami of misinformation and anti-vaccine sentiment online, including dozens of claims in several languages debunked by AFP Fact Check.

A Facebook post shared thousands of times warned against a ‚ÄúBill Gates‚Äù vaccine, after the billionaire pledged $250 million to fight COVID-19.

The message, circulated widely in Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Benin, falsely claimed that French doctor Didier Raoult ‚Äî a maverick who promotes the malaria drug chloroquine as a possible treatment ‚Äî said the vaccine ‚Äúcontains poison‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe West wants to destroy Africa‚Äù.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has flagged earning public trust as an urgent health challenge and warned of an ‚Äúinfodemic‚Äù ‚Äî a deluge of information, including misinformation on social media ‚Äî that is hampering the COVID-19 response.

The body says concerns that Africa could be abused as a vaccine testing ground are unfounded.

‚ÄúI would really reassure people that the clinical trials currently ongoing on the continent respect international standards and follow the same protocol as other developed countries,‚Äù Richard Mihigo, the WHO‚Äôs Programme Area Manager for Immunisation and Vaccine Development in Africa, told AFP.

There are more than 100 candidate vaccines in development around the world, with eight already being tested in human trials.

One such drug developed by Britain‚Äôs Oxford University was hit by misinformation last month when a widely-shared South African news article debunked by AFP claimed that a woman taking part in trials died shortly after being given the vaccine.

The volunteer, Elisa Granato, later confirmed she was ‚Äúabsolutely fine‚Äù.

‚Äì ‚ÄòRecognise the concerns‚Äô ‚Äì

Sara Cooper, senior scientist at the South African Medical Research Council, said misinformation had to be tackled by targeting underlying sentiment.

‚ÄúRather than dismissing these as ‚Äòfalse rumours‚Äô or ‚Äòerroneous beliefs‚Äô, these concerns should be heard and recognised,‚Äù she told AFP.

She said ethical research led by African scientists rather than by ‚Äútop-down‚Äù foreign programmes could ‚Äúgo a long way in rebuilding community trust and reducing resistance‚Äù.

In Nigeria, pharma giant Pfizer was sued when 11 children died in a meningitis trial in 1996. The families‚Äô lawyer claimed they could not have given proper consent as they did not speak English.

Despite the problems of perception, the WHO‚Äôs Mihigo was optimistic that when a coronavirus vaccine becomes available, it would be widely accepted in Africa.

‚ÄúCommunities know very well that when immunisation is not given, outbreaks do occur. We‚Äôve seen that with measles,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúPeople turn up overwhelmingly to vaccination campaigns. They know the benefits. They‚Äôve seen people dying.‚Äù"|https://www.independent.co.ug/misinformation-flood-hampers-fight-for-virus-vaccine-in-africa/
Kasese flood victims refuse to relocate|06/05/2020|"Kasese, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Residents displaced by the floods in Kasese district have refused to relocate to safe areas.

Floods hit Karusandara and Buhuhira sub counties leaving hundreds of people displaced and crops destroyed.

However, despite calls by local leaders to evacuate the residents to the sub-county headquarters, many have declined to the move.

The residents insist they have an ancestral background to their land, adding that they fear for their gardens being invaded by wild animals from Queen Elizabeth National Park.

Yohab Biryomumisho a local farmer from Karusandara sub county says he cannot relocate to the sub-county headquarters and leave his flood-spared small garden to animals.

Immaculate Achan a mother of four says despite his crops being submerged, she is reluctant to leave because of the large family.

Achan who is sleeping in improvised tent says she has lost everything from the agricultural season and sees no other reason to carry his four children to the sub-county.

Annet Santwine says a portion of their maize garden which remains safe is their only hope in the current times. She says they can only relocate if they are assured of better relief.

Elder Yofezina Nyakato says she is worried about losing her household properties to thieves since she can‚Äôt carry them to the proposed area for safety.

She wants the district leaders to organize for them means of safeguard before they are moved.

Gideon Ntabose, the Kasese LCV vice-chairperson says the floods have exposed the area to multiple diseases such as cholera. He insists that communities in disaster-prone areas will have to be forcefully vacated if they fail to adhere to the leaders call.

The Busongora South Member of Parliament Jackson Mbaju Kathika says he has compiled a report to be handed to the Ministry of disaster for an action. Kathika says he is teaming up with the local government to prepare for the evacuation of the community in the submerged areas to suffer places.

Floods destroy 25 houses in Kisoro|08/05/2020|"Kisoro, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Floods have destroyed 25 homes in Muramba Sub County in Kisoro district. The floods were triggered by heavy rains that hit the area on Thursday night lasting for over five hours.

Bernard Mushime, a resident of Sooko parish, says the floods erupted after the water levels in the Crater Lake on the top of Muhavura swell affecting villages in the low areas neighboring Muramba Sub County.

Abel Bizimana, the Kisoro District LC 5 Chairperson, says the floods also destroyed Kisoro-Nyarusiza-Muhabuura tourism road as well as many maize, beans and Irish potato gardens.

According to Bizimana, they have advised residents to shift to safer places for shelter as they assess the magnitude of damage and compile a report for submission to the office of the Prime Minister for support.

Heavy rains have caused havoc in various districts in western Uganda.

On Thursday morning, floods claimed the life of a Uganda People‚Äùs Defense Forces soldier and displaced more than 20 families in Busunga Town council in Bundibugyo District after River Lamia burst its banks.

This came a day after River Nyamwasa in Kasese also burst its banks and flooded Kilembe Mines Hospital. The floods washed away the medical store, kitchen, surgery rooms, private wards and drug store.

They also displaced over 500 people, destroyed bridges, Kilembe Mines powerhouse, electric poles, transformers and water supply systems.

On Sunday, two children were killed by floods in Muko sub county Rubanda district. Two more people were also killed in Isingiro district.

On Saturday Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) was forced to temporarily close Kabale-Ntungamo road resulting from landslides caused by heavy rains.

Rising water levels cause flooding in areas near Lake Albert|01/05/2020|"Ntoroko , Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Locals in Kanara sub-county, Ntoroko district are living in panic after rising water levels caused flooding in areas surrounding Lake Albert. The flooding has affected more than 50 families on the southern part of the lake whose houses were submerged.

The most affected areas are, Rwangara, Katanga, kacyankumo, Kanyansi and Kanara ward. The residents say that the overflow of water is having a negative economic effect on people who depend on the lake for fishing.

Agnes Kabakama, one of the affected residents says that the heavy floods destroyed part of her house taking away some of the household items.

Wilson Kabagambe, another resident says that the flooding destroyed most of their property. He is worried that since the country is under lockdown, the locals are finding it hard securing something to eat.

Other residents in the flood-affected areas are also scared of an outbreak of cholera after all the pit latrines were washed way. Kenneth Tusiime is worried that as the flooding continues, it might come along with cholera. Kanara Town Council mayor David Okor says they have requested for help from the government.

Gerald Rwemulikya Ibanda, the Ntoroko Member of Parliament says he has written to the Ministry for Relief and Disaster preparedness to consider offering aid to the district. However, the MP is worried that with the government still putting a lot of attention to the coronavirus, attending to such emergencies tends to delay.

The sub-county last year was also raged in floods after heavy rains washed away people‚Äôs properties and killed a number of domestic animals.

In 2016, the Ministry of Disaster designed the hazard, risk and vulnerability mapping exercise in the district to produce a district profile that will aid planning and decision making processes to address disaster risks in the district.

Expert predicts more flooding on Lake Victoria shores|13/04/2020|"Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Environment experts have predicated more flooding along the shores of Lake Victoria.

On Sunday, several areas within and beyond Entebbe Municipality were submerged by rising water levels of Lake Victoria. The submerged areas included Banga beach, beach line along Manyago, Kitubulu villages and Serena Hotel Kigo.

Others were Bugonga, Kigungu and Nakiwogo landing sites.

The Commissioner for Water Regulation and Management at the Ministry of Water, Dr Caliste Tindimugaya, says that the floods could get worse due to the rains and increasing inflows from mainly River Kagera and other rivers that pour water into Lake Victoria.

Tindimugaya explains that water levels of 1964 were over 13 metres compared to the levels recorded in February at 12.9 metres and 12.8 metres last month.

According to Tindimugaya, the ministry of water is trying to address the issue and has directed Eskom to gradually release more water from Lake Victoria into the River Nile at the Owen Falls Dam at Jinja.

Samson Semakula, the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) Environment Inspector for Entebbe Municipality says developers must respect the 200-metre zone.

He says that residents and operators along Lake Victoria shores should relocate because of projected higher water levels, and flooding from the rains.

The floods affected several residents and business people especially those with restaurants, shops and other premises near the lake shores.

Gideon Sande, a resident of Kibuga village in Karusandara who lost nearly 5 acres of maize in 2013, says that they started planting trees along the banks of River Mubuku as an intervention to mitigate future flooding.

Sande says that individuals in the community have voluntarily taken on a campaign to drum for the end any human activities along the river banks to control silting and erosion.

He says they have constituted community teams that monitor the behaviour of water levels to detect any early warning signs of disaster.

An elder Felix Kabarole Felix, says that they have been sensitizing the community to plant trees and eliminate grazing of animals along the river banks.

The LC III Chairperson Karusandara, Ezra Turyahebwa, says that the local community has been trained in practices that can reduce on flooding including good cultivation practices.

Augustine Kooli, the Kasese District Environment Officer states that the district with different partners and the local residents have managed to construct community gabions, a mini irrigation scheme and put up community early warning system through public address system.

He says communities have voluntarily been cleaning the river to keep it de-congested with waste.

Paul Zikuliza, the Lugonjo-Nakiwogo village chairperson says the water has mainly affected traders and residents of Lugonjo-Nakiwogo and Banga- Nakiwogo villages.

Zikuliza says the water has either submerged or washed 250 houses accommodating 1000 people in Lugonjo-Nakiwogo alone.

He has since advised the affected residents to relocate but around 300 haven‚Äôt moved citing financial constraints. Zikuliza says government should help the residents despite the fact that they settled near Namiiro swamp which is part of the 200 meter protected zone for Lake Victoria.

Some residents of Lusa village in Lugonjo-Nakiwogo zone have accused Entebbe Municipal councilors of trying to exploit the situation to develop the area. James Mulondo, who spoke on behalf of the affected residents said they are now hostile to all visitors including journalists for fear that they could pass information to councilors on potential buyers on how many people are still around.

But Zikuliza insists that all affected people must leave for their own safety and well-being. The area LC 3 councilor, Tadeo Kibirige is worried of a possible water borne disease outbreak in the area due to open defecation since all toilets have also been submerged. ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt leave, nature will now help us the leaders,‚Äù Kibirige said.

Driving in a flood|20/12/2019|"Avoid it if you can, be careful if you can‚Äôt

| MOTORING GURU | The rain these days is throwing up the unexpected. A road that you have driven on for years without incident will easily become flooded. That is why it is important to recall the tips you picked up during your defensive driving school. We share a few here.

First and most importantly, avoid driving on a flooded road. By flooded road we mean a road with at least 4 inches of water (your average car tyre is about 6.5 inches). That means if the water goes beyond half of your tyre avoid it. Remember the engine‚Äôs air intake on many cars is down at the front yet it takes just a fraction of a tea-cup of water sucked into your engine to damage it.

If you see water and figure it is too deep for you to walk through, then it possibly not a good idea to attempt to drive through either. Take extra caution if the water is moving. If moving water reaches the window level of your car, it is possibly enough to leave the car floating without grip on the surface below. Two feet of moving water (about your waist level) can sweet away most vehicles. It does not matter that you drive an SUV. Avoid flooded roads.

This caution is made for several reasons: Water beyond the mid-tyre level can easily enter the exhaust and kill off your engine leaving you stranded. Do not try to restart engine in water. It will be wrecked. Only 6 inches of water on the road is enough to cause you to lose control of the vehicle, often with dire consequences. Water under the car can easily splash into the electrical wiring and wreak havoc. So, avoid flooded roads.

But what if you cannot? Then you need to drive with extra caution. Here are some tips. They are in two parts; part one: deciding whether to drive through or not and two, how to drive through safely (possibly).

Before driving through any flooded road, never assume you know the road. Flood water does strange thing to roads. It can easily sweep away a whole section or move manhole covers. It can also hide stuff it has found in path and deposited on the road, including sharp objects or dead cows.

If you are unfamiliar with the road, test the depth of the water with a stick. Remember, the road is highest in the middle, so use that to gauge how deep it is on the sides.

When driving, plan your driving to avoid having to come to a complete stop in the water if you can; for example if there is a jam. Follow the path of the drivers before you who have crossed successfully. Drive slowly and steadily. This helps you avoid stirring up the water into a wave that makes it more difficult to drive.

If you do get stuck in flood water, especially if it is moving water; stay in the car because it is safer. Moving water is very powerful, it can sweep you off your feet and away. Also, if you feel the car starting to float, open a door to let water in. It will make the car heavier and possibly enable you to regain your grip.

After crossing a flooded patch of road, test your brakes before speeding off. If you are not comfortable, allow the brake pads to dry a bit and test again before driving off.

The 16 meter wide and 11km long Nakamiro channel is one of Kampala‚Äôs secondary channel with about eight tertiary channels that feed it direct from the communities of Kazo, Bwaise, Kawempe, Kalerwe and Kyebando among other. Nakamiro channel later feeds into the larger Lubigi channel.

However, the heavy rains reportedly over powered the Nakamiro channel causing water to spill into buildings. A stationary owner in Bwaise who preferred anonymity woke up to a flooded room where he operates. His room is a bit raised but this did not stop water from getting into the shop.

He says they woke up to a more difficult situation today having lived through quite a similar one last evening. He says water affected extension cables he had left on the ground and some boxes of paper that he found fallen on the ground.

He says whenever they experience heavy rains, the channel floods and water ends up in their structures. He wants KCCA to improve the physical plans in the area by promoting proper housing and drainage in the area so as to cub the effects that come with storm water. Apart from the channel being small, he says they also have accumulated large amounts of sand and garbage.

Another business owner only identified as Haula also woke up to a flooded room. Haula runs a clinic and when URN visited her premises at mid-day, she had just opened and cleaned the water before starting to work.

It took her more than two hours to clean the place. She says she was reluctant to open early when she heard from her neighbors that water had broken into her clinic. She later came and sought services of a young boy whom she paid to join her as they cleaned the clinic.

Apart from eating into her working hours, Haula says she incurs an extra cost to buy water and clean the premises. She says the rain water also affects her furniture forcing her to change it often.

Martin Ntege Kaweesa, a scrap dealer in Bwaise was not spared by the rains either. Ntege who runs a shop barely three meters away from Nakamiro channel had his entire compound filled with mud.

He however says the rains did not affect his business since he surrounded his house with piles of sand bags. Previously, the rains could affect the engine of the crusher machine he uses to crash plastics. Kaweesa says In his four years operating in the area, he has changed the engine of his machine thrice after it had been affected by the rains.

As part of Kampala Infrastructure Institution Development Project -KIIDP II, KCCA has plans to expand key drainage channels including Lubigi and Nakamiro channel.

According to KCCA, a total of 3.2 km will be expanded and lined with concrete from Kazo Angola to Lubigi. The channel will have an average width of 7m and there will be provisions for pedestrians to cross the channel safely.

Blocked waterway caused Pakwach floods|05/12/2019|"Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Truck drivers and members of the business community have blamed floods that devastated Pakwach yesterday, on a blocked waterway on the road connecting Pakwach to Paraa.

A part of River Nile in Nwoya district burst its banks on Tuesday causing floods that paralyzed business and transport on the road, the main gateway to West Nile region. Hundreds of vehicles and Trucks remained stranded as the Uganda National Roads Authority-UNRA closed the adjacent Bridge.

Joseph Mpasa, a truck driver with Trans East Company, whose truck got immersed in the floods told URN that the blockage forced excess water to find its way across the road. He explained that he was only saved from the truck by a good Samaritan, who swam and carried him on top of the truck.

According to him, over 100 bags of maize grain he was transporting to the refugee settlement in West Nile got soaked in the water. He says that the flood incident took travellers and locals by surprise.

Some of the locals say that the contractor had blocked the road as well as the culverts that drain water in to River Nile valley. Speaking in both Alur and English, the locals said that the tragedy led to the destruction of food items like maize, cassava and rice which were being transported from Nwoya to Pakwach.

David Musoke the director of MUKODA Engineering Works acknowledged that the agreed design necessitated setting a basement with stone cores which they undertook with ease after being told that November and December were dry months in West Nile in which they could freely block the drainage culverts, on Murchison Falls road.

The road was opened this afternoon after the waterway was unblocked, and the flood waters receded to allow the smooth flow of traffic across the Bridge.

Government sends rice to flood victims in Alebtong|22/10/2019|"Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Government has sent 600 kilograms of rice to residents affected by floods in Alebtong district.

The rice valued at about 2 million shillings is to be given to about 3000 residents in the sub counties of Akura, Omoro and Adwir.

The area was affected by floods two months ago destroying several crops including maize, beans, cassava among others. Some structures mainly grass thatched houses were also destroyed, several community roads cut off and toilet facilities also collapsed.

The areas have continued to experience floods up to now. Currently the rice is being kept at the district store pending distribution.

As a result, the district Disaster Preparedness Committee submitted to the Office of the Prime Minister the list of over 1000 households affected by the flood seeking relief food, tarpaulins and medicine for possible disease outbreak. The government through the Office of the Prime Minister responded by delivering to Alebtong district 600kgs of rice to support the affected residents.

Denis Johnson Okello, the Alebtong district LCV chairperson confirmed receiving the consignment saying they have been told to wait for more items yet to be delivered by government.

He says it will be handed over to the sub county leaders of the affected areas to manage and conduct the distribution.

Robert Okullo, the LCIII chairperson of Omoro sub county which is regarded as the most affected area wondered how they will be able to distribute the 600kgs among more than 3000 affected residents.

In Adwir sub county along, there are about 698 households of those affected and in dire need of relief items, representing more than 2000 people.

Okullo said it will be difficult to distribute the consignment suggesting since it is way too little for the entire affected people.

Christine Acen, the district woman MP urged the residents to remain calm as they continue waiting for more consignment to be delivered to Alebtong district. She suggests that since the number of those affected are more, the 600kgs must first be given to some few from a specific area.

Musa Ecweru, the State Minister for Disaster Preparedness in the Office of the Prime of Minister says they are yet to deliver more reliefs items based on the assessment report submitted by the area authority.

Alebtong district mainly in the sub counties of Omoro, Akura, Amugu and Abako often experience floods.

In July 2018 the sub counties experienced a two-month-long flood due to heavy rains destroying several crops, houses among others.

No christmas celebrations for Bundibugyo flood victims|25/12/2019|"Bundibugyo, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | While the rest of the World is celebrating Christmas, floods victims in the mountainous Bundibugyo District are living a tale of hopelessness and pain.

The more than 1000 displaced person camped at Semuliki High Secondary School in Harugale Sub County and Bubukwanga Transit Camp in Bubukwanga Sub County, have no hope of joining the festivities.

Rose Kugonza, one of the flood victims and mother of 5 from Busaru Sub County, says they lost everything during the Dec 7th, 2019 floods.

According to Kugonza, Christmas means nothing when she has no food for her children and place where she calls home.

Rose‚Äôs story isn‚Äôt any different from that of Biira Keziya, who describes this festive season as the hardest ever in their lives with limited or no food at all and an uncertain future.

Both mothers say they are harboring the pain of failing to make their young ones happy just like it has been in the past festive sessions.

80-year- Nelson Masereka told URN that they hardly get what to eat and when it happens it is a meal of posho and beans served once a day.

He expected the local leaders and Government to at least reach out to them during Christmas but nothing has happened over the last two weeks they have spent in the camp.

Rukara Johnston, the leader of Semuliki camp, says the authorities had earlier informed them that the camp isn‚Äôt a camp and advised that those with the capacity to join their relatives for Christmas should do so.

Rukara told URN that the affected residents have nothing to celebrate during this Christmas.

He also notes that they are at the risk of contracting diseases such as cholera because of the poor hygiene and sanitation in the camp.

Rukara notes that for the elderly like him, the conditions in the camp including sleeping on the floor, single meals and less medical attention are unfavorable.

Ronald Mutegeki, the Bundibugyo LC V Chairperson, says the District and local partners have offered what is within their means. He hopes that well-wishers and other partners can set a side something during this festive season for the flood victims both in camps and to those staying with friends and relatives.

According to our reporter, Semuliki, which hosts over 800 displaced persons, mostly mothers and children lacks bedding‚Äôs with some sleeping on the floor. Each classroom hosts about 100 people who sleep without mosquito nets and special shelters for mothers.

The December 7th floods in Bundibugyo devastated 12 sub counties from Bwamba and Bughendara counties and claimed 20 people. The rains also washed away several crop gardens, properties and soils from hill tops. Over 1,152 households were affected.

Emergency water treatment commences for 1,500 Bundibugyo flood victims|26/12/2019|"Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Uganda Red Cross Society-URCS has commenced emergency water treatment Nyalulu river in Bundibugyo district for flood victims as flash flood water contamination persists in 12 sub counties.

URCS erected the emergency water treatment plant at Nyauka bridge on Nyalulu river course, some 10 kilometers from Ssemuliki High School and Bubukwang Refugees Reception Center on Tuesday.

Irene Nakasiita, the Head of Communications and Public Relations URCS, says the plant treats 20,000 liters of water, which is distributed to the displaced persons using a water bowser truck.

‚ÄúWe have been testing the operations of the plant since Tuesday and found it to be working well. And so far we have treated more than 60,000 liters for each of the 1,500 displaced persons receiving between 10 ‚Äì 15 liters a day. We will increase the capacity of the plant as pressure at the source builds up with more water gathering into the stream‚Äù she told URN on phone on Thursday.

Nakasiita says the main sources of water contamination in the district include fecal matter from latrines overran by floods and open defecation as well as soil dirt from gardens and roads.

It is feared that drinking the contaminated water could trigger an outbreak of water borne diseases such as Cholera in the settlement camps.

The humanitarian agency says some 32,000 people have been affected and 18 others killed by landslides and floods that ravaged the district in recent weeks.

‚ÄúClearance of debris and restoration of livelihoods in homes destroyed by the floods remain a daunting task for government. And as you might know, these are outside the scope of Uganda Red Cross Society. But we might end up supplying seeds to help the displaced rebuild their livelihoods in the future,‚Äù Nakasiita added.

She says URCS was forced to suspend breakfast from the list of hot meals served to the displaced as supply of Rice and Maize flour delivered by government dwindles in the local government store.

Richard Bukone Sajjabi, the Bundibugyo Chief Administrative Officer, says government delivered more food aid for the displaced persons on December 24th, 2019. He however, couldn‚Äôt confirm the quantity of the relief.

Francis Xavier Ssenyondo, the Assistant Bundibugyo Chief Administrative Officer in charge of disaster response couldn‚Äôt be reached for a comment as his phones went unanswered.

Earlier in the week, URCS delivered non-food relief items to some 1,117 flood affected persons in the villages of Lusenke, Lusenke Farm and Namutya ‚Äì Soroti in Kayunga district where floods also destroyed homes.

Government says it will spend Shillings 70 Billion in reconstruction operations to rebuild public infrastructures ravaged by devastating floods triggered by environmental changes over the Indian Ocean.

It says up to Six Million people were affected.

What triggered floods in Uganda|17/12/2019|"Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | The current floods being experienced in Southern parts of the country will subside in January next year while in other parts at the end of December.

The floods which worsened in September has left several parts of the country cut off with landslides accompanying heavy rains in some hilly areas of Bundibugyo and Bududa districts.

Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA) says the above normal rains were caused by temperature and pressure difference over the Eastern and Western Indian Ocean ‚Äì a phenomenon scientifically known as the Indian Ocean Dipole.

Particularly, the one which triggered this year‚Äôs flood is known as the Positive Indian Ocean Dipole, Deus Bamanya, the Director of Applied Meteorology, Data and Climate Services at Uganda National Meteorological Authority says.

Bamanya says the Indian Ocean Dipole refers to the difference in sea-surface temperatures in opposite parts of Indian Ocean adding that it oscillates between Positive, Negative and Neutral states.

When Positive Indian Ocean Dipole occurs, the western Indian Ocean or the East African Coast becomes warmer and eastern part of Indian Ocean (Asia) becomes colder, and then becomes negative phase when the reverse is true.

When a positive Indian Ocean Dipole occurs, it aids higher evaporation and creates a low pressure zone in the western part of the ocean (East African Coast). And because hot air rises up, the cold winds in the colder Eastern part flow to occupy the vacuum left behind in the Western part.

This time, the reverse winds coming over the Western part of Indian Ocean arrived with lots of moisture triggering heavy rains in the African Continent near the Equator (the East African coast).

The arrival of the moist winds strengthened the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) ‚Äì a system of wind circulation responsible for rainfall formation over different seasons.

The strengthened ICTZ is what led to larger and more widespread storm clouds that resulted into wetter conditions across many East African Countries.

According to World Meteorological Organization, this year‚Äôs Indian Ocean Dipole has been the strongest on record since 2001 with surface temperature peaking up to +2.1 Degrees Celsius in mid-October.

Although it is currently weakening, recent observations put it at +0.9¬∞C, which is still well above the positive IOD threshold value of +0.4 ¬∞C, indicating that the current rains are reducing but can be sustained in the southern sector of Uganda till the end of December 2019.

The current rains have not affected Uganda alone, but also other neighbouring countries which include Kenya, Tanzania, South Sudan, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, DR Congo, and Central African Republic.

On the other side of Indian Ocean, it triggered droughts accompanied by bush fires. The strange weather phenomenon arrived shortly after Tropical Cyclone Idai hit the Coast of Mozambique and disorganized the return of early rainfall over the East African region.

Scientists say such adverse weather conditions will be exacerbated by Climate Change which will increase their frequencies of occurrences.

Floods kill 12 people in Bundibugyo|08/12/2019|"Kampala, Uganda | AFP | Twelve people have been swept to their deaths by floods in western Uganda, the Red Cross said on Saturday, as the East African country is battered by torrential rain.

‚ÄúWe have recovered 12 bodies from the water and one person has been rushed to hospital with serious injuries,‚Äù said Diana Tumuhimbise, Red Cross branch manager in the Bundibugyo district.

‚ÄúThe rain started last night and continued until 9:00 am (0600 GMT),‚Äù she told AFP on Saturday.

‚ÄúSeveral houses have been swept away, roads have been blocked and some washed away completely.‚Äù

The Red Cross has launched a search and rescue operation with the police, military and community members in 12 affected areas but it is not yet clear how many people are missing.

Livingstone University halts examinations over floods|24/11/2019|"Mbale, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Livingstone International University in Mbale has postponed its forthcoming examinations over floods.

The university was set to begin its semester one examinations on Nov 25th, 2019.

However, the university campus was flooded on Saturday after River Nabuyonga burst its banks following heavy rains.

Several other rivers including Nabuyonga, Namunsi and Manafwa among others burst their banks.

The floods ravaged several villages in the lower Sub counties of Mbale district and displaced hundreds of people.

Livingstone International University,which is located in Namakwekwe ward in Mbale municipality and next to river Nabuyonga was also affected.

The river burst its banks and flooded the university, water filled up all the classrooms, hostels and offices. All computers and documents were taken by the water.

This has prompted the university administration to postpone the examination until further notice.

John Khauka, the Livingstone International University Marketing Officer, said the rains found students asleep and flooded their rooms.

He said the water destroyed the belongings of students like beddings and book. The offices of the marketing officer and the dean of students are among those that were ravaged.

Khauka explained that this has made the university to halt the examinations since the students are physiologically affected. He says the exams will now be conducted in their new campus in Kamonkoli in Budaka district.

He says the move by the university to halt the exams is to enable students to recover from the calamity.

Derick Mesulam, a second Student of Media Technology welcomed the move, saying that they need a lot of time to recover from the trauma they went through during flooding.

Violet Namutosi, a student of Diploma in Media technology, says that all their classes are filled with water and mud.

Africa struggles to stem deadly flood of fake medicine|15/01/2020|"Lome, Togo | AFP | After he was struck down by malaria and typhoid, Togolese tailor Ayawo Hievi thought he was set to recover when he started taking drugs prescribed by his doctor.

But far from curing him, the medication he was given at the neighbourhood clinic made him far worse ‚Äî eventually costing him one of his kidneys.

The drugs were fake.

‚ÄúAfter four days of care, there was no improvement, but I started to feel pain in my belly,‚Äù Hievi, 52, told AFP.

After two weeks of suffering he became unable to walk and was rushed into the university hospital in the West African nation‚Äôs capital Lome.

‚ÄúThe doctors told me that my kidneys had been damaged‚Ä¶ the quinine and the antibiotics used to treat me in the medical office were fake drugs.‚Äù

Now, over four years later, he remains crippled by chronic kidney failure and has to go to hospital for dialysis regularly.

Hievi‚Äôs horror story is far from unique in a continent awash with counterfeit medicines.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that every year some 100,000 people across Africa die from taking ‚Äúfalsified or substandard‚Äù medication.

The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene estimated in 2015 that 122,000 children under five died due to taking poor quality anti-malaria drugs in sub-Saharan Africa.

Weak legislation, poor healthcare systems and widespread poverty have encouraged the growth of this parallel ‚Äî and deadly ‚Äî market. Since 2013, Africa has made up 42 percent of the fake medicine seized worldwide.

The two drugs most likely to be out-of-date or poor, ineffective copies are antibiotics and anti-malarials, say experts.

And bogus drugs not only pose a risk to the patient ‚Äî they also play a worrying part in building resistance to vital frontline medications.

‚Äì ‚ÄòDifficult to trace‚Äô ‚Äì

In a bid to tackle the scourge, presidents from seven countries ‚Äî the Republic of Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Niger, Senegal, Togo and Uganda ‚Äî meet Friday in Lome to sign an agreement for criminalising trafficking in fake drugs.

The goal is to bolster cooperation between governments and encourage other African nations to join the initiative.

But even if leaders put pen to paper, the task of stamping out the flows of counterfeit medication is huge.

Medicines spread out on plastic sheets or offered at ramshackle stalls are for sale at markets across West Africa.

Those hawked on the streets are often a fraction of the price of what‚Äôs available in more reputable pharmacies where controls are stricter and supplies often have to come through official channels.

‚ÄúIt is very difficult to trace where the fake medicines come from,‚Äù said Dr Innocent Kounde Kpeto, the president of Togo‚Äôs pharmacist association.

‚ÄúThe countries which are mentioned on the boxes are often not the countries of origin or manufacture of these drugs. The manufacturers cover their tracks so as not to be identified‚Äù.

It is estimated that between 30 and 60 percent of medicine sold in Africa is fake and Kpeto said most of it comes from China or India.

Efforts to staunch the deadly torrents of counterfeits have made some headway.

Some trafficking hubs have been dismantled, such as Adjegounle market in Cotonou that served as a key gateway for fakes heading to giant neighbour Nigeria.

In mid-November, the police in Ivory Coast made a record seizure of 200 tonnes in Abidjan and arrested four suspects including a Chinese national.

Togo is one of the pioneer countries trying to stop the flow.

It changed the law in 2015 and now traffickers can face 20 years in jail and a fine of some $85,000 (75,000 euros).

In a show of force in July the authorities burnt over 67 tonnes of counterfeit pharmaceuticals discovered between

But even given these recent successes, those in the industry like Dr Kpeto insist that the threat is still grave and involves ‚Äúhighly organised criminal networks‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe phenomenon remains major,‚Äù he said.

Traffickers can turn an investment of just $1,000 (900 euros) into a profit of $500,000, he claimed.

The fake medicines are smuggled in the same way as guns or narcotics and often bring higher returns.

‚Äì ‚ÄòDie for nothing‚Äô ‚Äì

Nigeria, Africa‚Äôs most populous country with a market of 200 million people, is the number one destination on the continent for fake drugs and a showcase of difficulties being faced.

In September 2016 the World Customs Organization seized tens of millions of fake pills and medicines at 16 ports around Africa: 35 percent were intended for Nigeria.

Across the vast nation there are tens of thousands of vendors selling the counterfeits.

Competition between traffickers is fierce and the official agency meant to combat the problem is overwhelmed.

In a bid to improve the situation, Vivian Nwakah founded in 2017 start-up Medsaf and raised $1.4 million to help Nigerians track their medication from producer to user.

‚ÄúThe country doesn‚Äôt have a reliable and centralised distribution network,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúA hospital sometimes has to deal with 30 or 40 distributors for all the medications it needs. How can you have quality control with so many suppliers?‚Äù

As a result, fake or faulty medicine has not just flooded markets but also pharmacies and hospitals ‚Äî both state and private.

Sometimes, without hospital administrators even being aware, that means the drugs that reach the patients can be expired, poorly stored or the wrong doses.

Medsaf works to ensure the quality control of thousands of products at over 130 hospitals and pharmacies in Nigeria. It looks forward to expanding deeper into Nigeria as well as Ivory Coast and Senegal.

The company uses technology, database management and analytics to monitor the movement of medications and verifies their official registration number, the expiry dates and storage conditions."|https://www.independent.co.ug/africa-struggles-to-stem-deadly-flood-of-fake-medicine/
Floods destroy property in Ntoroko|01/08/2019|"Ntoroko, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Residents of Kanara Town Council in Ntoroko district are counting losses after floods ravaged the area.

Hannifah Kabahweza, one of the affected residents, says that the floods killed 20 of her ducks and also destroyed their home.

Omuhereza Kemigisa adds that her seven hens and 13 chicks were not spared by the floods.

Christine Thembo, the Director Bright Future Nurturing Primary School says that the school‚Äôs rooftop was blown off by the rainstorm and the floods have now weakened the walls.

Cars stuck near proposed Lubowa hospital as floods hit Entebbe road|30/08/2019|"Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Entebbe road was temporarily cut off this afternoon after heavy afternoon rains left a valley, next to the proposed International Specialized Hospital Uganda at Zana-Lubowa, flooded.

Water and mud, mainly from the cleared hill where the hospital will be built, flooded the Entebbe road causing delays, as only heavy cars were able to cross the point of the flooding.

Government early this year approved a loan Guarantee of 379 million USD to Finasi/ROKO for the construction of Specialized Hospital, whose initial works have started.

The project has however been marred with controversies. Recently, ROKO, one of the project partners said that it was being unfairly kicked out in favour of a new company, Power China Guizhou Engineering Co, Ltd.

Kampala city‚Äôs deadly floods|24/06/2019|"Why experts now want KCCA to cope with, not fight rain

Kampala, Uganda | RONALD MUSOKE | For hundreds of thousands of Kampala residents, the onset of the rain season these days means suffering, losing property and even lives and this year‚Äôs rainy season has not been any different.

There is always apprehension and fear when dark rain clouds twirl above the city and its suburbs. Commotion ensues as matatu taxis and bodaboda cyclists and pedestrians hurry past known flood spots.

Many without better alternatives jostle for shelter to escape the looming downpour. Raindrops quickly turn into tropical showers within minutes and transform into a full-blown rainstorm triggering floods. Roads become rivers. Unlucky victims caught in its way become another statistic of flood deaths.

This year, the floods have been particularly devastating. On May 26 eight people were killed in a storm. Property valued in billions was destroyed.

In one photograph which went viral on social media, a chicken farmer tried to save hundreds of his chickens by climbing on the rooftop of his house with them. The farmer later identified as Richard Kanyike, 63, a resident of Lufuka zone in Bunamwaya said he lost over 300 chickens to the floods. He described how the water, which kept swelling until it rose to the window level of his chicken house, overwhelmed him.

Kampala sits on the northern shores of Lake Victoria, the world‚Äôs largest tropical lake which contributes a lot of the rainfall the city receives throughout the year. It is a city of wetlands; Lufuka, Kansanga, and Nakivubo wetlands in its southeasterly division of Makindye. Mayanja, Lubigi, Nabisasiro, Nasere in Kawempe division, and Nakalere, Nalubaga, Walufumbe and Kinawataka in Nakawa Division. These are the main ones. But almost every part of the city has its own wet pan where storm water gathers to wreak havoc.

This year, so far, it is the Kikajjo, Lubowa and Lufuka areas that have been hardest hit. They are in the Kyetinda flood area; a basin estimated to be about 1.4 square kilometres between Lufuka and Kansanga wetlands. Without floods, these would be prime real estate as it is between the Kampala-Entebbe highway and the Lake Victoria hind end zone of top beaches and hotels; include the Munyonyo Commonwealth Resort.

But the plight of residents is now a result of a mix of the same things that make other areas flood prone. Stated plainly, nobody should be living in these areas because they lie directly in the path of storm waters from higher lying areas of Makindye, Nsambya, Buziga, and more.

In the past, the storm water could flow smoothly into Lake Victoria through the Munyonyo wetlands. Today, as the city population has swollen to over 1.8 million, construction pressure has blocked most of the natural water drainage routes and no drainage channels have been constructed to replace them. The result is that even the least amount of rain now causes floods.

Godfrey Mujuni, the manager Data Centre at the Uganda National Meteorological Authority told The Independent on June 13 that most of the rain the city receives is moderate when compared to other flood-prone cities around the world. It should not be causing deadly floods.

Mujuni said, for example, although Kampala received a lot of rain over the month of May, the rains do not differ in significance when compared to past seasons.

‚ÄúWhat we have noticed is the intensity,‚Äù Mujuni told The Independent. ‚ÄúA lot of rain falling these days occurs in a shorter period of time.‚Äù

He said the limited drainage channels fail to cope with the run-off which is too much in a short period.

Mujuni told The Independent that it is in the second Dekad‚Äîperiod of 10 days‚Äî (May 10-20) that Kampala received the most rain. It rained on eight out of the ten days.

On May 11, Kampala recorded 37.5mm of rainfall. The following day, May 12, the weather experts recorded 22.8mm, on May 13, they recorded a trace (drizzle); on May 14, they recorded 18.8mm, while over the next five days, UNMA recorded 2.5mm, 2.8mm, 3.5mm, 21.3mm and 7.8mm, respectively.

Mujuni says rains become hazardous when an area registers above 50mm. So what has been happening in Kampala where the weather experts have been registering rains of below 40mm?

Mujuni says rains measuring 37.5mm would not normally cause havoc, especially if the rain is spread over a long period‚Äî say over 24-hours. But, if the same rains fall for just one hour, these could create havoc because of intensity.

On the deadly May 26, the day the floods caused havoc, the meteorology department registered just 2mm of rainfall over Kampala. But the previous day, more rain (19.1mm) had fallen over the city, and the day before that, another 8.2mm of rainfall had been registered. So the rains which fell on May 26 soaked the ground until it could take no more.

Collins Oloya, the commissioner for wetlands management in the Ministry of Water and Environment says the floods ravaging Kampala are as a result of the continuous disregard of the environmental laws.

Oloya told The Independent that the people who planned Kampala originally built it on seven hills because they appreciated the function of the wetlands but these have been completely destroyed.

‚ÄúNow KCCA needs a lot of money to control floods‚Äîa function which was being done by wetlands at a much low cost.‚Äù

Big budget needed

On April 4, KCCA‚Äôs top executives presented a budget of US$208 million (over Shs700 billion) to implement a 2017 drainage master plan that intends to fix 10 flood-prone areas in Kampala including; Lubigi, Nakivubo, Kinawataka, Kansanga, Nalukolongo, Ggaba, Walufumbe, and Mayanja.

KCCA‚Äôs drainage master plan seeks to control storm water by encouraging rain water harvesting, creating ‚Äúrain gardens,‚Äù green parks and open gardens, detention ponds, retention basins and associated wetlands.

In some of KCCA‚Äôs planned drainage projects, the Lubigi Channel which stretches a distance of about 3km from Bwaise to Hoima Road will be expanded again in some sections to about 40 metres while in other sections it will be as wide as 100 metres.

The Lubigi Channel is one of Kampala city‚Äôs major channels that evacuate storm water out of the city when it rains. It forms an arc around the city, starting around Kisaasi in the north of thecity and then stretches westwards passing Bwaise and Kawaala, then turns southwards through Busega.

The channel has feeder arms that stretch along the Kampala‚ÄìMityana Road towards Buloba, along Kampala‚ÄìMasaka Road towards Kyengera, along Kampala-Hoima Road towards Nansana and along the Mengo-Sentema stretch.

KCCA officials say the new drainage master plan intends to integrate the natural environment and infrastructure into a cohesive city-wide strategy for drainage development that minimizes the impact of flooding. But some experts argue that KCCA‚Äôs planned intervention will once again prove inadequate.

Bashir Twesigye, the executive director of Civic Response on Environment and Development (CRED), a Kampala-based non-profit told The Independent that the biggest challenge in Kampala is human encroachment on environmental resources like swamps that needs to be fixed.

Other experts also say Kampala‚Äôs persistent floods are a result of inadequate sensitization of the public, unplanned settlements and poor enforcement mechanisms and the mindset of the residents who continue to arbitrarily litter garbage."|https://www.independent.co.ug/kampala-citys-deadly-floods/
Nine youths die in Israel flash flooding: rescuers|27/04/2018|"Jerusalem, Undefined | AFP | Nine youths died Thursday after having been swept away by flash floods in southern Israel during a hiking trip near the Dead Sea, the Magen David Adom rescue service said.

Rescue efforts were ongoing to find a missing girl from a group of youths taking part in a programme to prepare them for military service, according to media reports.

Students in such programmes are usually around the age of 18.

A major rescue effort had earlier been launched to find what had initially been reported as several missing.

‚ÄúPolice & Emergency teams working together after flash floods struck the south of Israel near the Dead Sea where students were on a day trip,‚Äù police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld tweeted.

Military helicopters took part in the search in an area known as the Tzafit Stream, which hikers frequent for its desert scenery.

Another police spokesman, Merav Lapidot, said on Israeli television that ‚Äúinstructions to avoid this type of drama‚Äù were not respected.

President Reuven Rivlin said on Twitter that ‚Äúour thoughts go out to our brothers, our children and our loved ones who are dealing with a dramatic situation.‚Äù

Double curse: After drought, Kenya‚Äôs Dadaab refugee camps hit by floods|27/04/2018|"Dadaab, Kenya | AFP | The children can‚Äôt believe their luck: storms and showers have turned their dirt football pitch into a lake. Youngsters scamper and splash through the murky water, chasing one another, leaping and laughing.

Any entertainment is welcome in Dadaab, one of the biggest refugee bases in the world. An estimated 235,000 people, most of them Somalis, live a bleak life largely defined by drought, dust and destitution.

But the children‚Äôs fun is fleeting. The seasonal rains also bring cholera and malaria, destroy rickety hand-made homes and paralyse the aid operation that is the refugees‚Äô lifeline.

Some tracks and paths in the camps are thigh-deep in water. A woman gathers her soggy hijab about her as she wades through it. A man rolls up his trousers as high as he can but they still get wet. Progress is slow.

‚ÄúWe have nowhere to sleep‚Ä¶ the water has covered everything,‚Äù said Hassan Yussuf, a 34-year-old father of five.

The earth floor of his home, built of thorny sticks and corrugated tin, is under 20 centimetres (almost eight inches) of water.

‚Äì Search for dry land ‚Äì

The family has relocated to the foot of a nearby tree, their meagre belongings hung in its branches.

Inside their hut only one bed remains, above the waterline for now. On it and still dry lies Yussuf‚Äôs blind, 80-year-old mother.

‚ÄúI hang out in one place or another, always looking for somewhere dry,‚Äù he said, hoping the night will not bring more floods.

‚ÄúDadaab is located on a plain where the rainwater does not drain easily, there are no drainage systems and no nearby river,‚Äù explained Caleb Odhiambo of charity Save the Children, which works in the camps. ‚ÄúIt can be several weeks before the water returns to a normal level.‚Äù

In the meantime, pit latrines are overflowing, contaminating the water and threatening to spread disease.

Cholera is the greatest danger, especially for children who play in ‚Äî and anyone who drinks ‚Äî the contaminated waters.

Every year rainy-season cholera outbreaks infect many hundreds of the refugees who have fled cycles of civil war and famine in Somalia since 1991."|https://www.independent.co.ug/double-curse-after-drought-kenyas-dadaab-refugee-camps-hit-by-floods/
E-scooters: a transport ‚Äòtsunami‚Äô flooding cities worldwide|05/07/2019|"Paris, France | AFP | They appeared in June last year as Paris was waking up from its annual all-night Festival of Music: hundreds of green-and-black electric scooters dotting the pavements of the capital.

The timing was perfect, with the city struggling with a botched revamp of its main bike-sharing service that left countless frustrated users looking for a new form of transport.

Cheap, widely available and easily unlocked with a smartphone app, e-scooters checked all the boxes, becoming wildly popular overnight.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs happened very quickly and a bit of an anarchic way,‚Äù admitted French Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne in May.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs effectively been the law of the jungle.‚Äù

Over the course of a year, a total of 13 operators piled into the Paris market, putting 20,000 scooters on the streets in a chaotic free-for-all that left legislators at a loss in a country normally known for its rigorous rules and regulations.

The backlash wasn‚Äôt long coming ‚Äî pedestrians terrorised by silent riders speeding down pavements, randomly-parked scooters cluttering curbs and the city‚Äôs historic squares, and a growing number of accidents.

This practical and fun form of transport, seen from Boston to Bangkok, has posed major regulatory problems, with city officials worldwide taking different approaches, from laissez-faire in Paris to a virtual blanket ban in London.

‚Äì Transportation tsunami ‚Äì

Electric scooters were first launched in California in September 2017 by a startup called Bird, followed eight months later by competitor Lime.

By half-way through 2018, they had both hit Europe, moving swiftly on into the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.

Today, Bird and Lime are the largest shared-scooter operators in the world.

‚ÄúAny city in the world that has been working on its transportation policy, even 18 months ago, wasn‚Äôt anticipating this tsunami,‚Äù said Joel Hazan, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group.

‚ÄúIt has been the fastest rollout in the history of mobility services and the quickest wave to spread across the world. It‚Äôs basically gone global over the past two years.‚Äù

For cities, the main headache is safety, but experts say that can only be addressed with a rethink of urban planning.

Elderly people knocked flying, pedestrians with broken bones, riders killed in a crash ‚Äî though the horror stories exist, there is ‚Äúno reliable data on collisions‚Äù, a European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) says.

Nippy and speedy, scooters zip along at up to 25 kilometres an hour (15 miles an hour), making them too fast for the pavement but problematic on roads.

Most cities would like to allow e-scooters on bike lanes, but that space often doesn‚Äôt exist.

‚ÄúCities are designed for car usage and the new question we face is how do we split the space that we‚Äôve been dedicating to cars to create more space for pedestrians, for bikes and e-scooters,‚Äù says BCG‚Äôs Hazan.

‚ÄúSecurity will only work if we can segregate the space,‚Äù he said.

‚Äì ‚ÄòGeofenced‚Äô parking ‚Äì

Space is also a problem with issues like parking, said Philippe Crist, an advisor to the International Transport Forum at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

‚ÄúA tremendous amount of the city is devoted to on-street parking, and if there is clutter on the pavement, it‚Äôs because there is very little space elsewhere,‚Äù he said.

Cities are now re-allocating on-street parking space to bikes and scooters, he said.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt actually require much ‚Äî some have just started painting lines on pavements‚Äù as designated parking bays, he said, while others are experimenting with GPS technology to keep parking to a designated area.

Known as ‚Äúgeofencing‚Äù, it can stop a user logging off and finishing a ride if left in the wrong place.

‚ÄúIf not left in the right place, the operator can charge an extra fee or not allow the trip to finish, so it will keep (charging the user) until it‚Äôs in that area,‚Äù he said.

Another innovation automatically throttles down the speed within a designated zone, he said.

‚Äì Ban to plan ‚Äì

Not everyone has jumped on the bandwagon, with London the only major city in Europe where e-scooters are banned unless a rider has a driving licence, insurance, road tax, a helmet and a number plate.

Although new regulations are under consideration, for the moment the law is strictly enforced.

Last year, a 15-year-old boy got six points on his future driving licence after being caught on a scooter riding at high speed.

‚ÄúThe best policymakers in the world are banning e-scooters, not forever, just to launch it in an organised, controlled and efficient way that is synchronised with the rest of the transportation modes,‚Äù said BCG‚Äôs Hazan.

Singapore is one such example, where new laws came into force on July 1 following a pilot involving three local start-ups.

Now only the 85,000 registered e-scooters with a licence plate are allowed on the city‚Äôs bike paths, with offenders facing a fine of 1,500 US dollars (1,300 euros) or three months in jail.

There is a 10 kilometres-per-hour (six miles-per-hour) speed limit, which is carefully monitored by officers with speed guns, and members of the public are urged to report any speeding or reckless riding.

Using GPS tracking, riders are fined for parking illegally and the city offers a Safe Riding programme.

‚ÄúCities are trying to impose much more rigorous standards on how they are deployed and what information is required from them,‚Äù said Crist, pointing to the rapid turnaround in Paris.

In recent months, the city banned riding and parking on pavements, and has imposed a code of conduct under which operators will eventually have to geofence parking spots and enforce automatic speed curbs.

Five or six of the city‚Äôs 13 fleet operators have pulled out in the past week, Crist said."|https://www.independent.co.ug/e-scooters-a-transport-tsunami-flooding-cities-worldwide/
CAA explains flooding at Entebbe Airport|17/04/2018|"Entebbe, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Entebbe International Airport was briefly in the spotlight Monday as heavy rains continued to pound many areas of Uganda including the Lake Victoria shores.

Airport management and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had to put in place emergency measures as water flowed into the arrivals area at Entebbe on Monday.

NORTH KIVU: 12 dead, 92 missing as floods hit eastern DR Congo|20/09/2017|"Goma, DR Congo | AFP | At least 12 people died and 92 were missing after heavy rains caused flooding in two villages in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, an official said Wednesday.

‚ÄúThe provisional toll after torrential rain hit the villages of Bihambwe and Matanda in Masisi Territory is 12 dead, 18 injured and 92 missing,‚Äù said Julien Paluku, governor of North Kivu province, where the villages are located.

The rain started on Tuesday, causing a river to flood, local residents told AFP.

‚ÄúThe rain began in the afternoon, forcing those coming back from the fields to take shelter in homes near the river. The flooding caught them by surprise,‚Äù said Joseph Ndabita, a resident of Bihambwe.

He told AFP he had counted ‚Äú10 bodies and (seen) others being swept away by the strong current towards the river.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe water which came down from the mountains has caused damage,‚Äù said Safari Ayobangira, a local MP, who said searches were underway to find the missing.

Most of the victims were farmers whose fields bordered the Bihambwe river which passes the two villages that lie about 50 kilometres (30 miles) northwest of Goma, the regional capital.

In mid August, at least 150 people died when a massive mudslide devastated Tara, a fishing village on the shores of Lake Albert near the country‚Äôs northeastern border with Uganda.

The vast country has experienced several natural disasters caused by torrential rain.

In May 2010, a wall of mud swept through the eastern village of Kibiriga, killing 19 people and leaving 27 missing.

Urban sprawl in spotlight after historic Houston floods|03/09/2017|"Washington, United States | AFP | Rapid, poorly regulated urbanization in Houston has exacerbated the impact of flooding from Hurricane Harvey, experts say, warning that local authorities must pay attention as global climate change threatens to intensify extreme weather events.

A residential and commercial construction boom the Greater Houston area, even in floodplains, that went practically unrestricted has drastically reduced the ability of the area‚Äôs soil to absorb rainwater.

At the same time the area saw 42 percent population explosion between 1995 and 2015, to stand at around 4.4 million people today.

To keep apace, some 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) of swampland and grassy meadows were urbanized, according to research by the Texas A&M University.

The greatest loss of rainwater harvesting areas took place in Harris County, which encompasses Houston, the fourth most populous US city which has seen a 30 percent of its wetlands disappear.

The Port of Houston and its environs, which lies on average thirteen meters (42 feet) above sea level, has lost the capacity to absorb fifteen billion liters (four billion gallons) of precipitation in the event of a tropical storm, according to the study.

Harvey dumped an unprecedented 56 trillion liters, or 1.3 meters (51 inches) of rainfall over the area.

In addition the expanding drainage system, consisting of a network of reservoirs, canals, bayous and roads, was not designed to cope with storms this large.

‚Äì Texan individualism ‚Äì

‚ÄúThere are a lot of industries in Houston so there are a lot of jobs and people, and we don‚Äôt have zoning restrictions in place so you don‚Äôt have the best planning ‚Äî and that was one of the shortfalls,‚Äù said Joel Scata with the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Since 2010, at least 7,000 residential buildings have been raised in Harris County on land designated by federal authorities as being at risk of flooding.

Local elected officials both in Houston and Harris County for years have resisted stricter construction rules.

Residents voted three times against the adoption of an urban planning code ‚Äî even though Houston regularly faces tropical storms and flooding, notably in April 2016 and before that May 2015, which claimed 17 and eight lives respectively."|https://www.independent.co.ug/urban-sprawl-spotlight-historic-houston-floods/
Houston battles massive floods, Trump set for Tuesday Texas trip|28/08/2017|"Houston floods spark chaos, much more rain to come

Houston, United States | AFP | Massive flooding unleashed by deadly monster storm Harvey left Houston ‚Äî the fourth-largest city in the United States ‚Äî increasingly isolated Sunday as its airports and highways shut down and residents were rescued from their inundated homes by boat.

The city‚Äôs two main airports suspended all commercial flights and two hospitals were forced to evacuate patients. A local television station also was knocked off the air.

At least three people have been killed so far, with reports of other fatalities still unconfirmed. As night fell, dramatic rescues ‚Äî sometimes by volunteers with their own boats ‚Äî were still taking place.

The National Hurricane Center called the flooding ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù and said the storm, which crashed ashore late Friday as a huge Category 4 hurricane, would move into the Gulf before doubling back midweek, bringing even more rain.

President Donald Trump, who had said he did not want to disrupt emergency efforts with a visit, is planning to head to the disaster zone on Tuesday, the White House announced.

Rising waters from Harvey inundated roads throughout the Houston area, affecting every major freeway and hamstringing efforts to move people to safety.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy to see the roads you‚Äôre driving on every day just completely under water,‚Äù Houston resident John Travis told AFP.

Another city resident, Brit Dreger, said: ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt look like we‚Äôre going anywhere for a while.‚Äù

Overwhelmed emergency services warned residents to head for high ground or climb onto rooftops ‚Äî not into attics ‚Äî so they could be seen by rescue helicopters. More than 2,000 rescues had been made so far.

The local ABC affiliate showed the helicopter rescue of a man and his six-year-son ‚Äî both named Jeremiah ‚Äî from the second floor of their home. Each only had the clothes on their back and a backpack.

‚ÄúThis is all we got,‚Äù the father said. ‚ÄúWe thank God. We thank God.‚Äù

Emergency 911 operators in Houston received 56,000 calls in a 15-hour span ‚Äî seven times more than in a usual full day.

‚ÄúWe are going on fumes & our hearts ache for community we serve, but we will not stop!‚Äù said Houston police chief Art Acevedo.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott warned the operation was far from over, given the foreboding forecasts.

‚ÄúThe number of evacuees is increasing. The number in harm‚Äôs way will increase also with the rain that is forecast to come,‚Äù Abbott said, adding that the storm had already inflicted billions of dollars in damage.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner dismissed the idea that evacuations should have been ordered sooner.

‚ÄúYou issue an evacuation order and put everybody on the highway ‚Äî you really are asking for a major calamity,‚Äù Turner told reporters.

Houston proper has a population of 2.3 million people, but the greater metropolitan area has more than six million.

Mass burials for Sierra Leone flood victims|18/08/2017|"Freetown, Sierra Leone | AFP | The first mass burials of victims of Sierra Leone‚Äôs devastating floods and mudslides take place on Thursday, as blame grew over government ‚Äúinaction‚Äù over deforestation and poor urban planning.

As it emerged that at least 105 of the dead were children, citizens and experts alike questioned why the government of President Ernest Bai Koroma had not done more to tackle illegal construction in the overcrowded capital Freetown.

A Red Cross official told AFP meanwhile that smaller mudslides had occurred since Monday in eastern Freetown and in Sierra Leone‚Äôs second city of Bo, with the rainy season far from over.

‚ÄúThere is a fear that more trouble is imminent,‚Äù in Freetown, a coastal city of around one million people, said Adbul Nasir of the International Red Cross.

The disaster began on Monday when heavy rains hit the city and the partial collapse of a hillside triggered mudslides, engulfing homes and wreaking destruction.

Although the death toll is officially 300, rescue workers privately agree the toll is far higher. An unofficial morgue toll put the number of deaths from at 400.

The UN has said 4,000 people are affected by the mudslides and flooding.

Citizens were given the deadline of Wednesday evening to identify their loved ones at the overflowing central morgue, and the first mass burials will begin at 3 pm (1500 GMT) in Waterloo, a nearby town where many victims of the Ebola crisis that hit the nation in 2014 were also laid to rest.

The burial of bags filled with body parts has already taken place but Thursday marks the first burials of corpses in a ceremony to be attended by Koroma.

‚Äì ‚ÄòNo place to sleep‚Äô ‚Äì

For the thousands of survivors left homeless, UN agencies distributed food and hygiene kits to those sheltering in government centres and in the homes of neighbours and family members.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said 3D mapping of affected neighbourhoods was taking place around Sugar Loaf mountain, which partially collapsed on Monday, and said voluntary evacuations may extend to more areas, potentially increasing the number of displaced.

‚ÄúWe have no place now to sleep, only in a neighbour‚Äôs house,‚Äù said Abdul Bendu, in the Pentagon community, which sits directly below the devastated hilltop village of Regent.

He estimated that 100 people from his community alone had been killed by mud, falling rocks and floodwaters.

Zimbabweans flood streets as Mugabe‚Äôs future in balance|18/11/2017|"Harare, Zimbabwe | AFP | Thousands of protesters flooded Zimbabwe‚Äôs streets demanding Robert Mugabe‚Äôs resignation on Saturday in a movement organised by independence war veterans and backed by ruling party barons and the army.

The mass turnout came after an unprecedented week which saw the army‚Äôs top brass seizing power and putting Mugabe under house arrest in response to his sacking of Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa.

It was a stunning turnaround for Mugabe who has ruled Zimbabwe with an iron fist since 1980.

Veterans of the liberation war, who had previously supported Mugabe, had called for the gathering which saw marchers rallying in Highfield, a working-class suburb of Harare, with another demonstration staged in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe‚Äôs second city.

‚ÄúThis is the best day of my life. We are hoping for a new life after Mugabe,‚Äù said 38-year-old Sam Sechete who was marching with a crutch.

A symbolic location, Highfield was where Mugabe gave his first speech after returning from exile in Mozambique ahead of independence in 1980.

Demonstrators, who began arriving around midnight, roared, whistled and danced, brandishing placards proclaiming: ‚ÄúNot coup but cool‚Äù and ‚ÄúMugabe must go!‚Äù

‚Äì ‚ÄòToday is independence‚Äô ‚Äì

Such an open display of disloyalty would have been unthinkable just a week ago as dissent was routinely crushed by security forces.

In a statement released on Friday, the army said it fully supported the protests.

‚ÄúToday is independence, we are suffering too much,‚Äù said 14-year-old marcher Grace Kazhanje.

‚ÄúThis is our new independence day.‚Äù

By 0800 GMT, several thousand people were at the scene, AFP correspondents said, although buses bringing more demonstrators were continuing to arrive.

MOTORING: When your vehicle gets flooded|15/03/2018|"The dos and don‚Äôts

Kampala, Uganda | MOTORING GURU | As the annual long rains of March to May set in, chances of getting caught up in a flood rise. When that happens, know that your vehicle could be rendered irreparable or else, it might require quite some money and effort to get it back into drivable shape.

Depending on how deeply the car is submerged, it might end up with extensive rust and corrosion, or severe electronics damage. Even if the damage is not apparent immediately, it could appear later.

As a first step, ensure that you do the following:

Quickly assess the extent of your car‚Äôs flood damage, and weigh repair costs against the cost of replacing your car. Depending on how deeply the car is submerged, consider not restarting your car as this will cause more dam- age if there is water in the engine.

Act quickly. Get the car towed out of the water as quickly as possible and set on higher ground.Start drying out your vehicle as quickly as possible.

Drain oil and transmission fluids and lubes before towing. Pay special attention to th e engine. Get an expert mechanic to check it out. If there are water droplets on the oil dipstick, it might indicate water in the engine.

If that‚Äôs the case, the cylinders, which are supposed to compress air instead of water, will be broken. Replace them. Change the oil and transmission fluid. You‚Äôll want to do this again after the car is drivable and you‚Äôve gone sev- eral hundred kilometres.

Clean the interior. If floodwaters went inside your car, remove carpets and dry out seats with a soak cloth. Remove seats and seat cushions if possible, and dry them in the sun. Turn the A/C on and use strong air freshener to remove the difficult smell of mold and mildew, especially from wet seats and AC vents. If damage is extensive reupholster the entire car.

Get the car cleaned as a fine layer of silt will cover everything; including difficult to clean engine compartments, air cleaner, and spaces in the interior.

Check the spare tire compartment for signs of moisture, inside the head- lights for standing water or fog. Check electrical components and replace damaged parts. Ensure that the radio and other signals work. Check fuses box and battery terminals.

Check the fuel tank and line. If you note any water (which would naturally separate from the fuel), you‚Äôll want to empty the tank completely. If the windows of your car aren‚Äôt sealed very well, you might hear water sloshing around in your car.

That is flood water trapped inside your doors. If you look along the bottom of the door, you‚Äôll see several plugs. Use a screwdriver to open them and let water will drain out."|https://www.independent.co.ug/motoring-when-your-vehicle-gets-flooded/
In DR Congo, flood tragedy highlights perils of urban sprawl|06/01/2018|"Kinshasa, DR Congo | AFP | The morning light showed a scene of desolation as people in Ngaliema surveyed the wreckage of shanty homes swept away by killer floods and landslips.

Among the 44 people who perished overnight Wednesday in Kinshasa, the capital of Democratic Republic of Congo, were a teenager, Brunelle, her sister Gladys, and Gladys‚Äô baby.

Their home of makeshift yellowish clay bricks, located at the foot of a steep slope literally dissolved after the waters struck, neighbours said.

‚ÄúThe emergency services came, but they arrived late, around 4:00 am,‚Äù said a young man, Magloire, who said that he was the one who found the bodies.

The disaster was one that could have been avoided ‚Äî the rainfall was indeed torrential but not exceptional, given this city‚Äôs location in the heart of central tropical Africa.

But mass fatalities were sadly predictable, given the triple contribution of poverty, uncontrolled development and over-population. Homes made of flimsy materials had been built illegally and without foundations in a place vulnerable to floods.

‚ÄúThis is uncontrolled building,‚Äù said Ruffin Abedi, deputy chief of Ngaliema district.

‚ÄúThe regulations have stipulated for years that people shouldn‚Äôt live there. But people settle there anyway, because they don‚Äôt have the money to go elsewhere.‚Äù

A Chinese company had been contracted to install drainage on a road at the top of the slope, but the pipes were swept away by the rain, and lay among debris at the bottom, near a sofa ‚Äî the only visible sign of a home that once stood there.

‚Äì Chaotic city ‚Äì

‚ÄúThe solution is to move people who live in flood-prone areas to places which are habitable,‚Äù said Roger-Nestor Lubiku, former director-general of the Congo Geographic Institute (IGC).

Such things are easier said than done, in a city whose population size is little more than a good guess, and which lacks an accurate land registry.

A common estimate is that the DRC capital has 10 million inhabitants, amounting to a rough doubling over less than 20 years, and accounting for possibly a seventh of the national population.

Between 2000 and 2005 alone, the population rose from six million to 7.5 million, according to satellite pictures.

A 2009 study in the Belgian Review of Cartography ‚Äî Belgium, the former colonial power, retains close ties with the DRC ‚Äî found that 30 percent of urban development had taken place on steep slopes with an incline of 15 percent, or more than one in seven. ‚ÄúThese present a significant risk of erosion,‚Äù it warned presciently.

Three-quarters of homes in Kinshasa are slums which have no access to sanitation or electricity, Corneille Kanene, former head of UN-Habitat, said last year. The opposition blames the problem on poor governance and the flaws of the state.

The proximity of these slums to wealthy areas is also a shock, and a reminder of DRC‚Äôs deep inequalities. Ngaliema‚Äôs ramshackle homes lie just a few hundred metres (yards) from the villas of Macampagne and a couple of kilometres (miles) from the tower blocks, embassies and mansions of Gombe."|https://www.independent.co.ug/dr-congo-flood-tragedy-highlights-perils-urban-sprawl/
Death toll in SLeone flood disaster reaches 441|20/08/2017|"Freetown, Sierra Leone | AFP | The death toll from a mudslide and flooding that struck Sierra Leone‚Äôs capital Freetown has reached 441, the government said on Saturday.

‚ÄúFour hundred and forty-one corpses (were) buried as at yesterday,‚Äù the deputy minister of information and communication, Cornelius Deveaux, told AFP, adding that the number of missing was ‚Äústill being calculated.‚Äù

A tally of deaths, issued on Friday by the Red Cross, had stood at more than 400, with around 600 others listed as missing.

At Connaught Hospital, morgue worker Mohamed Sinneh Kamara gave a slightly higher toll than the minister‚Äôs.

‚ÄúWe buried 50 more bodies on Friday. We have so far buried 450 corpses,‚Äù he told AFP. ‚ÄúMost of the bodies were found decomposed and families were not allowed to identify (them).‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre receiving calls from disaster-hit communities every three to four hours about a corpse found in a drainage or under a collapsed building.‚Äù

Three more bodies were found in a search for survivors in the Regent district, where the side of a hill collapsed, the emergency services said.

The disaster struck on Monday after Freetown, home to 1.2 million people and the capital of one of the world‚Äôs poorest countries, had been pounded for three days by torrential rain.

According to the charity Save the Children, the disaster killed 122 children and left 123 orphaned.

The Red Cross has issued an emergency funding appeal. Britain, the former colonial power in Sierra Leone, has pledged ¬£5 million ($6.45 million, 5.45 million euros), while China has pledged $1 million (850,000 euros) and Togo $500,000.

Water-borne diseases such as cholera and malaria are a major fear.

‚ÄúThis is a potential health hazard. That‚Äôs why we need to continue the operations to ensure that we remove as much dead bodies as possible,‚Äù said Colonel Abu Bakarr Sidique Bah of the Sierra Leone armed forces.

But the search for victims has been arduous, especially in the Regent neighbourhood.

‚ÄúIt is actually thousands of tonnes of rubble that have fallen‚Ä¶ (down) the hill‚Ä¶ And the inclement weather, the rain, has also made it very difficult for equipment to move within the affected area,‚Äù he said.

Flooding is an annual menace in Sierra Leone, where ramshackle homes are regularly swept away by seasonal rains. In 2015, floods killed 10 people and left thousands homeless."|https://www.independent.co.ug/death-toll-sleone-flood-disaster-reaches-441/
Global warming will expose millions more to floods|11/01/2018|"Miami, United States | AFP | Global warming is expected to unleash more rain, exposing millions more people to river flooding particularly in the United States and parts of Asia, Africa and central Europe, researchers said Wednesday.

The study in the journal Science Advances calculates how much more flood protection will be needed to keep the risks of high-end floods constant in the next 25 years.

Unless actions are taken ‚Äî such as enhancing dykes, boosting building standards, relocating settlements and managing rivers ‚Äî the number of people affected by devastating floods could skyrocket, warns the report, based on models that are 10 times more precise than commonly used climate computer simulations.

Asia ‚Äî the continent with the largest historical high-end flood risk ‚Äî would get hit the hardest, with the number of people affected by river flooding projected to go from 70 to 156 million by 2040, it said.

For instance, Pakistan, already prone to flooding, ‚Äúwill observe almost a doubling in high-end flood risk,‚Äù with 11 million people at risk of floods unless protective measures are taken by 2040.

‚ÄúIn South America the number of people affected by flooding risks will likely increase from six to 12 million, in Africa from 25 to 34 million,‚Äù it added.

In Germany the number of people affected is projected to rise sevenfold, from 100,000 to 700,000.

In North America, it could rise from 100,000 to one million.

‚ÄúMore than half of the United States must at least double their protection level within the next two decades if they want to avoid a dramatic increase in river flood risks,‚Äù said lead author Sven Willner from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).

The increase in river flood risks over the next few decades is being driven by the amount of greenhouse gases already emitted into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels.

When more heat-trapping pollutants surround the Earth, more moisture is held in the air, leading to more rainfall.

Cutting these emissions is crucial to reducing flood risks for future generations.

‚ÄúIt is clear that without limiting human-caused warming to well below two degrees Celsius (36 Fahrenheit), river flood risks in our century will increase in many regions to a level that we cannot adapt to,‚Äù said Anders Levermann, a researcher at Columbia University‚Äôs Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in New York.

‚ÄúThe findings should be a warning to decision-makers,‚Äù added Levermann.

‚ÄúDoing nothing will be dangerous.‚Äù"|https://www.independent.co.ug/global-warming-will-expose-millions-floods/
Sierra Leone appeals for urgent help after deadly floods|16/08/2017|"Freetown, Sierra Leone | AFP | Sierra Leone‚Äôs president appealed Tuesday for urgent help for the flood-hit capital of Freetown, where more than 300 people are feared dead, as rescue workers continued a grim search for bodies after one of the worst natural disasters to hit the country.

The Red Cross said it was struggling to excavate families buried deep in the mud that engulfed their homes, though several bodies were pulled up by machines in the devastated hilltop community of Regent on Tuesday, according to an AFP journalist at the scene.

Addressing the media in Regent, one of the areas hit hardest by the flooding, President Ernest Bai Koroma fought back tears as he said the devastation ‚Äúwas overwhelming us‚Äù.

‚ÄúEntire communities have been wiped out,‚Äù Koroma said at the disaster site, where heavy rains streaming down the hill caused a landslide and engulfed homes three or four storeys high on Monday, many of them built illegally.

‚ÄúWe need urgent support now,‚Äù he added.

The government has promised relief to the more than 3,000 people left homeless, opening an emergency response centre in Regent and four registration centres, while the Red Cross said 600 people were still missing, though the Interior Minister put the number in the thousands.

Israel and Britain said they were sending aid as quickly as possible to the stricken west African city of about one million people.

Red Cross spokesman Patrick Massaquoi told AFP on Monday that the death toll was 312, but another Red Cross official, Abu Bakarr Tarrawallie, put the death toll at 245 in an email to AFP on Tuesday, while local media and officials all gave different tolls.

‚ÄúWe are racing against time, more flooding and the risk of disease to help these affected communities survive and cope with their loss,‚Äù Tarrawallie said.

‚Äì ‚ÄòSprawling shacks all gone‚Äô ‚Äì

At the Regent site, residents told AFP that boulders and rocks had killed many as they rolled onto homes in the early hours of Monday, while a hill partially collapsed as floodwaters streamed down the slopes.

One resident, Abubakar Mansaray, said it took just two minutes for the mudslide to suffocate families in the darkness.

‚ÄúMany unfinished buildings were at the hilltop, with those sprawling shacks all gone,‚Äù he told AFP.

Survivors required immediate shelter, medical and food assistance, and dozens of injured people were receiving treatment, the Red Cross‚Äôs Tarawallie said.

Abibatu Kamara, a mother of three who spent the night on her neighbours‚Äô veranda, said the government response so far had been absent.

‚ÄúWe have not received any food or blankets since the disaster occurred yesterday,‚Äù she told AFP.

‚Äì Stagnant water ‚Äì

Three days of torrential rain culminated on Monday in the Regent mudslide and massive flooding elsewhere in the city, one of the world‚Äôs wettest urban areas.

Makeshift settlements that clung to the hills and shores were swept away or torn apart.

The city‚Äôs drainage system was quickly overwhelmed, leaving stagnant water pooling in some areas while creating dangerous churning waterways down steep streets.

Society 4 Climate Change Communication (S4CCC), a local environment group, called the tragedy a ‚Äúwake up call‚Äù.

‚ÄúMan-made activity meets climate-change head on, a predictable event now made tragically real,‚Äù the group said in a widely shared blog post.

Deforestation, a lack of urban planning and the nation‚Äôs existing vulnerability to climate change had all played their part, they said.

Sierra Leone‚Äôs meteorological department issued no warning ahead of the torrential rains, which might have allowed for swifter evacuations from the disaster zones.

‚Äì Foreign donors mobilise ‚Äì

At the city‚Äôs military hospital, community health officer Wilberforce Mohammed Rogers said he had treated several children with multiple injuries, including a six-month-old baby. Many had lost their parents, Rogers said.

An AFP journalist met victims sleeping in schools, community centres and out in the open, while others squeezed into the homes of relatives.

Foreign governments, meanwhile, began mobilising aid to Freetown.

Israel‚Äôs foreign ministry said it would provide ‚Äúassistance immediately and in every way possible‚Äù including clean water, medicines and blankets.

British International Development Secretary Priti Patel said she was ‚Äúdeeply saddened‚Äù by the devastation and was working with the government to establish what next steps to take.

‚Äì Annual ordeal ‚Äì

Freetown is hit each year by flooding during several months of rain, raising the risk of waterborne diseases such as cholera.

Flooding in the capital in 2015 killed 10 people and left thousands homeless.

Sierra Leone was one of the west African nations hit by an outbreak of the Ebola virus in 2014 that left more than 4,000 people dead in the country, and it has struggled to revive its economy since the crisis.

The country ranked 179th out of 188 countries on the UN Development Programme‚Äôs 2016 Human Development Index, a basket of data combining life expectancy, education and income and other factors.

Fuel tanker overturns as floods cut off Tirinyi road|18/04/2017|"Work is ongoing to ensure Mbale Highway re-opens on Wednesday after three diversions on the road that is under repair, were submerged after a heavy downpour on Monday.

Media reports indicate one person lost his life after a taxi plunged into one of the flooded areas. The road, that is managed by Dott Services, has several bridges over river Mpologoma.

According to a statement from Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA), all heavy vehicles were Tuesday diverted to the Tirinyi ‚Äì Pallisa ‚Äì Kamonkoli route, while safe passage has been created for smaller vehicles along the Nakalama‚ÄîTirinyi‚ÄîMbale road.

One truck driver did not adhere to the advice and on arrival at the submerged area, the truck over-turned. Police, who are now in charge of the area, was called to the scene for rescue and to avert the usual rush to loot fuel by the locals.

‚ÄúIn the meantime, the contractor along with our team is working round the clock to ensure the road is reinstated and opened to traffic within 24 hours,‚Äù UNRA said.

The heavy downpour on Monday affected several areas on the Nakalama‚ÄîTirinyi ‚Äì Mbale Highway, with three of the diversions previously created by the contractor to enable ongoing rehabilitation works washed away.

The first diversion which had been created at Km53 was completely flooded, the diversion at Km57 was partly washed away and submerged by water and the third diversion at Km77 was completely washed away along with the main culvert.

The government has promised relief to the more than 3,000 people left homeless, opening an emergency response centre in the hilltop community of Regent, while Israel said it was sending aid as quickly as possible to the stricken west African city.

Registration centres to count the homeless were due to open across Freetown, a city of around one million people, while Interior Minister Paolo Conteh warned via Sierra Leone‚Äôs state broadcaster that thousands of people remained missing.

Red Cross spokesman Patrick Massaquoi told AFP on Monday that the death toll was 312 but this is expected to rise further as his team assess disaster areas in Freetown and tally the number of dead.

President Ernest Bai Koroma appealed for unity from a nation still struggling with the legacy of Ebola and a long civil war in an address to the nation on Monday.

‚ÄúOur nation has once again been gripped by grief. Many of our compatriots have lost their lives, many more have been gravely injured and billions of leones‚Äô worth of property destroyed in the flooding and landslides that swept across some parts of our city,‚Äù he said.

Sierra Leone mourns 100 children among dead in massive flooding|17/08/2017|"Freetown, Sierra Leone | AFP | Sierra Leone began a week of mourning Wednesday as it emerged that 105 children were among more than 300 people who perished in mudslides and torrential flooding, in one of the country‚Äôs worst natural disasters.

With 600 people still missing in Freetown, President Ernest Bai Koroma described the humanitarian challenge ahead as ‚Äúoverwhelming‚Äù.

He said flags would fly at half-mast and called for urgent help after visiting the devastated hilltop community of Regent on Tuesday.

Aid organisations meanwhile warned that the rainy season was not yet over and that more flooding could arrive at any moment in the west African coastal city of around a million people.

Officials at Freetown‚Äôs central morgue said Wednesday that 105 of the more than 300 officially dead were children. An independent but unofficial morgue estimate put the toll at 400 dead.

The government of Sierra Leone, one of the poorest countries in the world, has promised relief for what the Red Cross says is more than 3,000 people left homeless by the disaster.

The authorities have opened an emergency response centre in Regent and registration centres to count those left on the streets.

Several UN agencies have ramped up efforts in Freetown, including the World Food Programme‚Äôs (WFP) distribution of two-week rations of rice, pulses and cooking oil to 7,500 people. The first Israeli aid packages arrived and west African governments delivered cash and rice.

‚Äì Mass burials to begin ‚Äì

Speaking to AFP at the mortuary at the Connaught Hospital, technician Mohamed Sinneh Kamara said his team lacked equipment to process and identify the bodies still piling up.

‚ÄúWe have logistical constraints including a lack of gloves, PPE (personal protective equipment) and rain boots,‚Äù he said as families gathered to identify their loved ones‚Äô bodies.

Mabinty Sesay‚Äôs family had gone to Regent for an all-night prayer session when their church was buried in the mudslide. ‚ÄúI have lost 13 of my family members but was only able to identify two,‚Äù she told AFP at the morgue.

One woman collapsed after seeing her husband‚Äôs dead body among the piles of corpses, amid a powerful stench of decomposing flesh.

The Red Cross clarified that burials which took place on Tuesday were of body bags filled with missing parts of corpses. The government said mass burials of unidentified bodies still at the morgue would take place on Thursday and Friday.

‚ÄúThe situation with all the dead bodies now‚Ä¶ No one is able to identify anyone. So as the president said, let the mass burials go ahead,‚Äù said Adizah Conda at the morgue after losing seven members of her extended family.

At least 221 dead in India, Bangladesh, Nepal floods|16/08/2017|"Saptari, Nepal | AFP | At least 221 people have died and more than 1.5 million been displaced by monsoon flooding across India, Nepal and Bangladesh, officials said Tuesday, as rescuers scoured submerged villages for the missing.

In Nepal, severe flooding has left tens of thousands of homes totally underwater in the populous southern lowlands, with nearly 20 percent of the population affected.

‚ÄúAs per the data we have received so far, 111 have been killed, 35 are still missing and a search operation is underway,‚Äù Home Minister Janardan Sharma told parliament Tuesday.

A third of neighbouring Bangladesh is flooded, with at least 29 dead as relentless monsoon rains pound the densely-populated riverine country.

‚ÄúAnother 1.5 million people have been marooned,‚Äù Reaz Ahmed, head of Bangladesh‚Äôs disaster management department told AFP.

Almost 1,200 shelters have been erected across Bangladesh, while the army has been deployed to reinforce weakened river embankments and to assist with search and rescue operations.

In the border district of Lalmonirhat, roughly 600 Indian nationals took shelter in Bangladeshi villages along with their stricken livestock, the district‚Äôs government administrator Shafiul Atif told AFP.

India has also suffered from torrential downpours and flash flooding, worsening a monsoon that has already claimed lives.

At least 81 people have died in the eastern states of Bihar and West Bengal, and northeastern Assam state, over the last few days, a government official told AFP on Tuesday.

Train services have been cut entirely to the northeast, and at least 200,000 people are living in emergency camps in Assam, a remote state that suffers frequent flooding during the annual rains.

Deadliest African floods over past two decades|15/08/2017|"Freetown, Sierra Leone | AFP | The massive flooding in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown, which has left hundreds of people dead, is among the worst on the African continent over the past two decades.

Here are Africa‚Äôs most deadly floods during that period:

‚Äì El Nino in East Africa ‚Äì

From October 1997 to January 1998, more than 6,000 are killed in flooding caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon, which pounds Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. In Somalia, 1,800 die and 230,000 are left homeless when the Juba river overflows its banks on October 18.

‚Äì Algiers under water ‚Äì

On November 10, 2001, 764 people die and 125 are listed as missing after heavy floods in the north of Algeria. The flooding devastates part of Algiers, the capital, where 713 are killed, mainly in the residential neighbourhood of Bab El-Oued.

‚Äì Devastation in Mozambique ‚Äì

In February to March 2000, unprecedented floods in Mozambique leave 699 dead and 95 missing, and about 60,000 people are sheltered in camps set up by the authorities.

Then, in January 2015, the Licungo river, which cuts Mozambique in two, surges by 12 metres (39 feet), a phenomenon which had not been seen since 1971.

The floods devastate the province of Zambezie, where 160 are killed and 177,000 made homeless. In neighbouring Malawi floods kill 176 people and leave 153 missing, while more than 200,000 are displaced.

‚Äì Carnage in Ethiopia ‚Äì

In August 2006 at least 639 die in deadly flooding in Ethiopia. An additional 35,000 people are displaced and 200,000 affected by the floods which strike the east, the southwest and north of the country.

‚Äì The 2010 rainy season ‚Äì

Flooding during the 2010 rainy season, one of the most deadly ever recorded, leaves at least 377 dead and impacts 1.5 million people in West Africa.

The countries recording the most deaths are Nigeria (118), Ghana (52), Sudan (50), Benin (43), Chad (24), Mauritania (21), Burkina Faso (16), Cameroon (13) and Gambia (12).

Tributes flood in for S.African anti-apartheid icon Kathrada|29/03/2017|"Johannesburg, South Africa | AFP | Celebrated South African anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Kathrada, one of Nelson Mandela‚Äôs closest colleagues in the struggle against white rule and a fellow Robben Island prisoner, died Tuesday aged 87.

Kathrada was among those tried and jailed alongside Mandela in the 1964 Rivonia trial, which drew worldwide attention to the brutalities of the apartheid regime.

He died in hospital in Johannesburg after a short illness following brain surgery, his charity foundation said.

Kathrada spent 26 years and three months in prison, 18 of which were on Robben Island, the notorious jail off the coast of Cape Town.

After the end of apartheid, he served from 1994 to 1999 as parliamentary counsellor to President Mandela in the first African National Congress (ANC) government.

Leading a flood of tributes, retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu described Kathrada as ‚Äúa man of remarkable gentleness, modesty and steadfastness‚Äù, hailing him a moral leader of the anti-apartheid movement.

‚ÄúThese were people of the highest integrity and moral fibre who, through their humility and humanity, inspired our collective self-worth ‚Äî and the world‚Äôs confidence in us,‚Äù Tutu said in a statement.

‚Äì Lifelong activist ‚Äì

Kathrada‚Äôs activism against white-minority rule started at the age of 17, when he was one of 2,000 ‚Äúpassive resisters‚Äù arrested in 1946 for defying laws that discriminated against Indian South Africans.

The ANC party was banned in 1960, and two years later Kathrada ‚Äî often known as ‚ÄòKathy‚Äô ‚Äî was placed under house arrest.

Soon afterwards, he went underground to continue the struggle as a member of the ANC‚Äôs armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK).

In July 1963, the police swooped on Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, outside Johannesburg, where Kathrada and other senior activists were meeting in secret.

At the famous Rivonia trial, eight of the accused were sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour on Robben Island.

His fellow prisoners included Mandela, Walter Sisulu and Denis Goldberg.

‚ÄúThe nation has lost a titan, an outstanding leader and a great patriot,‚Äù the ANC said after his death was announced.

‚ÄúHis life is a lesson in humility, tolerance, resilience and a steadfast commitment to principle.‚Äù

The Nelson Mandela Foundation lauded him as ‚Äúthe embodiment of promise‚Äù during the apartheid years, saying Kathrada was ‚Äúa comrade, associate and close friend of Nelson Mandela‚Äôs through seven decades.‚Äù

‚Äì Key negotiator ‚Äì

Released from prison in 1989, the softly-spoken Kathrada belonged to a generation of freedom fighters untainted by later corruption scandals.

In jail, he was a teacher for fellow prisoners and a strategic thinker who formed part of the ANC delegation in the negotiations that finally ended apartheid.

‚ÄúHe will be remembered as an unassuming freedom fighter, whose wisdom, tolerance, humility, steadfastness and humour earned him the love and respect of our people,‚Äù said South Africa‚Äôs Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.

‚ÄúAfter the achievement of democracy and the adoption of a new democratic constitution‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòKathy‚Äô was determined to continue to serve the people.‚Äù

Kathrada chose not to pursue a political career, but remained an activist.

He was critical of the current ANC government under President Jacob Zuma, which has been accused of graft, mismanagement and failing black South Africans.

‚ÄúI can imagine how pained he was that he left at this particular time,‚Äù Winnie Mandela, Nelson‚Äôs former wife, told reporters Tuesday.

‚ÄúAll what he had fought for is not what is going on today. It is a tragedy that he did leave and saw what is happening. We cannot pretend South Africa is not in crisis.‚Äù

He was survived by his wife, Barbara Hogan, also an ANC stalwart.

Kathrada will have an Islamic burial on Wednesday, the foundation said, while the government ordered national flags to be flown at half-mast."|https://www.independent.co.ug/tributes-flood-s-african-anti-apartheid-icon-kathrada/
312 dead as mudslides, flooding sweep through Sierra Leone capital|15/08/2017|"Freetown, Sierra Leone | AFP | At least 312 people were killed and more than 2,000 left homeless on Monday when heavy flooding hit Sierra Leone‚Äôs capital of Freetown, leaving excavators to pull bodies from rubble and overwhelming the city‚Äôs morgues.

An AFP journalist saw several homes submerged in Regent village, a hilltop community, and corpses floating in the water in the Lumley West area of the city, as the government held an emergency meeting to plan its response to one of the worst natural disasters ever to hit the city.

Red Cross spokesman Patrick Massaquoi told AFP the death toll was 312 but could rise further as his team continued to survey disaster areas in Freetown and tally the number of dead.

Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries in the world, according to UN indicators.

‚ÄúI counted over 300 bodies and more are coming,‚Äù Mohamed Sinneh, a morgue technician at Freetown‚Äôs Connaught Hospital, told AFP, having earlier described an ‚Äúoverwhelming number of dead‚Äù at the facility leaving no space to lay out every body.

Many more of the dead were taken to private morgues, Sinneh said.

Sierra Leone‚Äôs military, police and Red Cross volunteers were meanwhile deployed in an all out effort to locate and rescue citizens trapped in their homes or under rubble.

Images obtained by AFP showed ferocious, churning dark-orange mud coursing down a steep street in the capital, while videos posted by local residents showed people waist- or chest-deep in water trying to cross the road.

The Sierra Leone meteorological department did not issue any warning ahead of the torrential rains to hasten evacuation from the disaster zones, AFP‚Äôs correspondent based in Freetown said.

‚Äì ‚ÄòLost everything‚Äô ‚Äì

Fatmata Sesay, who lives on the hilltop area of Juba, said she, her three children and husband were awoken at 4:30 am by rain pounding on the mud house they occupy, which was by then submerged by water.

‚ÄúI only managed to escape by climbing to the roof of the house when neighbours came in to rescue me,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe have lost everything and we do not have a place to sleep,‚Äù she told AFP in tears.

Deputy Information Minister Cornelius Deveaux confirmed President Ernest Bai Koroma had called a national emergency, and said his own boss, Information Minister Mohamed Bangura, was in hospital after being injured in the flooding.

Deveaux said ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of people had lost their lives and had properties damaged, and promised food and other assistance for the victims.

He called on the public to remain calm with rescue efforts underway.

‚Äì Piles of corpses ‚Äì

The scale of the human cost of the floods was only becoming clear on Monday afternoon, as images of battered corpses piled on top of each other circulated and residents spoke of their struggles to cope with the destruction and find their loved ones.

Meanwhile disaster management official Vandy Rogers said that ‚Äúover 2,000 people are homeless,‚Äù hinting at the huge humanitarian effort that will be required to deal with the fallout of the flooding in one of Africa‚Äôs poorest nations.

Freetown, an overcrowded coastal city of 1.2 million, is hit each year by flooding during several months of rain that destroys makeshift settlements and raises the risk of waterborne diseases such as cholera.

Sasha Ekanayake, Save the Children‚Äôs Sierra Leone Country Director, said the immediate priority was to provide shelter and protect residents, especially children, from the spread of deadly waterborne diseases.

‚ÄúWe are still in the rainy season and must be prepared to respond in the event of further emergencies to come,‚Äù she said in a statement.

Flooding in the capital in 2015 killed 10 people and left thousands homeless.

Sierra Leone was one of the west African nations hit by an outbreak of the Ebola virus in 2014 that left more than 4,000 people dead in the country, and it has struggled to revive its economy since the crisis.

About 60 percent of people in Sierra Leone live below the national poverty line, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

The country ranked 179th out of 188 countries on the UNDP‚Äôs 2016 Human Development Index, a basket of data combining life expectancy, education and income and other factors.

Fears for 600 still missing in Sierra Leone floods|16/08/2017|"Freetown, Sierra Leone | AFP | Concerns shifted Wednesday to the estimated 600 people still missing and thousands made homeless in Sierra Leone by deadly floods in the capital, as it emerged that at least a third of those killed were children.

The United Nations said Tuesday that it was evaluating humanitarian needs in Sierra Leone, while the first Israeli aid packages were sent and Britain pledged its support.

Officials at Freetown‚Äôs central morgue said 105 of the more than 300 officially dead were children, and burials began on Tuesday for some of the bodies too mutilated to identify. An independent but unofficial morgue estimate put the toll at 400 dead.

President Ernest Bai Koroma fought back tears on Tuesday as he visited the devastated hilltop community of Regent, saying the scale of the challenge ahead was ‚Äúoverwhelming us‚Äù.

‚ÄúEntire communities have been wiped out,‚Äù Koroma said. ‚ÄúWe need urgent support now.‚Äù

The government of Sierra Leone, one of the poorest countries in the world, has promised relief to what the Red Cross says is more than 3,000 people left homeless, opening an emergency response centre in Regent and registration centres to count those left on the streets.

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in New York that the UN country team was ‚Äúsupporting national authorities in rescue operations, helping evacuate residents, providing medical assistance to the injured, registering survivors, and providing food rations, water and dignity kits to those affected.‚Äù

‚Äì From shock to anger ‚Äì

Speaking to AFP at the mortuary at the Connaught Hospital, technician Mohamed Sinneh Kamara said his team lacked equipment to process and identify the bodies piling up.

‚ÄúWe have logistical constraints including a lack of gloves, PPE (personal protective equipment) and rain boots,‚Äù he said as families gathered to identify their loved ones‚Äô bodies.

Mabinty Sesay‚Äôs family had gone to Regent for an all-night prayer session when the church was buried in the mudslide. ‚ÄúI have lost 13 of my family members but was only able to identify two,‚Äù she told AFP at the morgue.

One woman collapsed after seeing her husband‚Äôs dead body among the piles of corpses, amid a powerful stench of decomposing flesh.

Adele Fox, national health coordinator for Sierra Leone for the charity Concern Worldwide, told AFP that the search for bodies continued but that survivors were facing difficult conditions."|https://www.independent.co.ug/fears-600-still-missing-sierra-leone-floods/
Floods return, find an unprepared govt|04/12/2008|"By Melina Platas

After the floods of 2007 that affected over one million Ugandans, there was a flurry of activity as NGOs and government officials raced around to ensure that such a scale of destruction and death would not occur again. In January 2008 over 60 people from over 30 organizations met in Soroti for a Uganda Floods Lessons Learnt Workshop. Then in March 2008 another 50 people from over 25 organizations met in Kampala for a Disaster Preparedness Workshop. Out of these various meetings came a slew of reports, presentations, speeches and plans.

In fact you can find most of them on the Uganda Clusters website at http://www.ugandaclusters.ug/disaster.htm. The rains have been considerably more mild this season, but we are once again faced with heavy flooding in West Nile and eastern Uganda that has again affected thousands of people, destroying homes, infrastructure and food crops. For all of the meetings held and for all of the money spent, is Uganda really prepared for disaster?

Under the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry for Relief and Disaster Preparedness, or the Ministry of Disaster Unpreparedness as some like to call it, is supposed to serve as the lead actor on disaster preparedness in Uganda. Whenever a crisis occurs, you will find the Minister of State for Disaster Preparedness, Musa Ecweru, dashing here and there to consult with technicians and local politicians of the affected areas, and begging for money from NGOs, donors and charities around the world to help solve whatever problem has arisen.

This time around is no different. According to Ecweru, UNICEF, UNOCHA, UNHCR, WFP, FAO, WHO and Uganda Red Cross, are the major actors on the ground. The minister explains that in the flood-affected regions, gardens were flooded and crops that had just recovered from last years floods were once again destroyed. That is going to create a problem of food security, Ecweru says.

Katakwi district LC5 chairman Robert Ekongot says that, apart from loss of crops, there is a lot that districts hit by last years floods have to recover from. According to UNOCHA, educational and health sectors have been hardest hit in Katakwi. Deterioration of roads, especially feeder roads, has also been problematic in the flooded regions. Amuria district chairman, Julius Ochen says, The roads are still in very bad condition, and we are yet to see what funds mobilized during flood appeals have done for our people.

As usual, the ministrys plan of action is to run for help. We are going to mobilize more money. My ministry may have to launch an appeal to the UN, donors and charities. One year after catastrophic flooding in this country, homes have again collapsed, bridges have again been swept away, and crops have again been destroyed so what happened to all the planning? What happened to all the preparedness?

According to Ecweru, the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness took its draft Uganda Disaster Preparedness Plan, which was created during one of the workshops in early 2008, to cabinet in September. Cabinet was touched by what we highlighted, he says. But they ultimately requested that the ministry go enrich it self by comparing notes with best practice countries for disaster preparedness before the plan is implemented. We are supposed to have done that now, says Ecweru, But the mood now in Europe is for Christmas we may not get the attention we need. But it was not Christmastime two months ago when they were advised to travel, so why did they wait until now, when the rainy season is almost over? There are logistical implications, says Ecweru, Few resources and stuff like that. And what resources, exactly, are needed? Dont worry, Ecweru responds, as government we are going.

The minister of state does not seem particularly fond of prodding or specific questions, and his minister in cabinet, Prof. Tarsis Kabwegyere, does not seem keen on listening to any hints of criticism either. After Fungaroo Kaps Hassan, MP for Obongi county in Moyo district, a region hard-hit by this years floods, spoke out in the media in November, Kabwegyere wrote him a note which was read aloud on Kfms Hot Seat radio show last week, saying: Honourable Fungaroo, I read your contribution to flooding relief in the newspapers today, in future we would share the problems by finding solutions before addressing the world. Dont find faults, find solutions. The problem of flooding is going to be with us with global warming which you can hardly control.

But finding solutions does not seem to be the problem key actors have spent hours and days and dollars discussing solutions. Implementing solutions, however, is the far greater challenge, and one that the ministry has yet to live up to.

But all told, just how much money is currently being spent to respond, if not prepare, for disasters in Uganda? Ecweru doesnt know. I really dont handle issues of finances, he says. That is a matter for his technical people.

Ecweru was preparing to fly off to West Nile this week, with a camera to take photos, he added. But it is not clear how this trip, or hundreds of others like it, is providing any service to the people desperately in need of assistance. Lets hope the technical people know what they are doing."|https://www.independent.co.ug/floods-return-find-unprepared-govt/
Fighting the floods|05/12/2011|"By Mubatsi Asinja Habati

Ugandan farmers fail to adjust to changing weather as counterparts surge ahead

Forty-four year-old Regina Mbambu, a single mother of six, farms coffee inter-planted with spinach, mangoes, avocados, bananas, beans and maize on her one acre patch in Kasese district in western Uganda. Last year, most of her crop failed. The severe drought hit her coffee trees so hard that most dried up.

So when it started raining in March this year Mbambu was expected to celebrate. She did not.

‚ÄúThe rains came heavily. The amount of rains that we usually receive in two months poured in one week,‚Äù she said.

And they were very destructive rains.

‚ÄúThey swept away my entire maize and beans garden. The rains let me down because I had spent my energy, little money investing in farming but I now expect no harvest. Mangoes are rotting on the trees and coffee trees are no longer yielding as before.‚Äù

She says previously in a good season, she would get six bags of coffee (276kg) but this season, she harvested only 2 bags (92kg).

She says the unpredictable variation in weather and climate has negatively affected how much she earns from her farm produce. ‚ÄúMy son who is supposed to be starting university education will have to wait for a good season.‚Äù However, she is uncertain when the good season will come.

Mbambu‚Äôs dilemma is made worse because meteorological information that would warn her early is lacking. The metrological department that would provide it is handicapped. Studies of climate trends in Uganda are limited by absence of long-term meteorological data. The limited available data reveals source difficulties as it is collected from a fragile network of only 15 weather stations. There are also gaps in station records due to poorly equipped facilities, and lack of investment in infrastructure and people to man the weather departments. An official of Uganda‚Äôs meteorological department says a survey the department carried out recently found that only 10% of Ugandans use the weather forecast information it sends out. The rest do not trust it.

As we write this story, the weather station in Gulu, the biggest district by population in northern Uganda, is down. Bundibugyo district in western Uganda, which is 2216 sq.kms and home of the scenic but climatically sensitive Rwenzori snow-capped mountains has no weather station and depends on Kasese to make predictions. Neighbouring Ntoroko and Kabarole districts in the Rwenzori are equally handicapped.

Food scarcity hits

Naomi Mbambu, the Kasese District Vice Chairperson, is concerned about the changing weather and climate. She recalls that in the past, because of the cold climate on the Rwenzori mountains, crops would grow all year round. Today, she says, farmers planting crops depending on two annual seasons because it is becoming hotter.

‚ÄúFood shortages which we used to hear ravaging other parts of Uganda could be dawning on us soon,‚Äù she warns.

Already, government officials are blaming the scarcity and spike in food prices for protests that have sporadically erupted in major urban centres in a wave called the ‚ÄúWalk-to-Work protests‚Äù. Initially, the scarcity was blamed on poor crop yields resulting from prolonged drought early in the year. The story could be changing to blame erratic rains.

A recent survey by Africa Climate Change Resilience Alliance, a regional NGO, says the ‚Äúfluctuations and uncertainties of seasonal rainfall ‚àí whether premature, delayed, prolonged or failed‚Äù reflect bad news for over 70% Ugandans who depend on rain-fed agriculture. The survey notes: ‚ÄúIncreased intensity of flash floods has led to erosion of fields, both high and low lands reported the negative impact of unpredictable seasons on cropping patterns and resultant low yields leading to reduced food availability as increasing drought periods compound the food insecurity problem.‚Äù

Regional issues

Weather and climate related crises are a regional challenge.

Kenya, Uganda‚Äôs neighbor to the east is 80% marshland, scrub, and desert. Droughts are not unusual. But this year the drought has been more prolonged and severe. Driving out of Nairobi city, the rocky ground appears thirstier. Even in the pastoral savannah Masailand to the south, where pasture is a lifeline for man and stock, grass is barely growing. Brown stone boulders stalk travelers stretching miles all the way to the soda ash Lake Magadi. The few desert plants that grow in this vast rocky land are hardly green. Plants in the Masailand are a rich gold on colour but the land is poor with barren soils. These days, the corrugated iron huts of Masai cattle herders that dot the vast semi-arid land are constantly under a cloud of dry dust.

‚ÄúDrought has left many animals dead including in national parks. The loss of animals to pastoralists has affected them most because it‚Äôs their only source of livelihood. Government is encouraging planting of trees to absorb greenhouse gases and irrigation for famers,‚Äù says Mohamed Lugh, Deputy Director of public communications at Kenya‚Äôs Ministry of Environment and Mineral Resources.

Changing lifestyles

Changing weather and climate are changing lifestyles here. Stories of prolonged droughts that have ravaged stock are being replaced by those of pastoralists taking to farming. Irrigation schemes, like the Ngurumani, are taking root.

A largely farmers‚Äô effort, the Ngurumani Irrigation Scheme got help from local NGOs and has recently attracted the attention of the Kenya government and African Development Bank to invest KShs 300 million. The simple surface irrigation in Kajiado, covering 350 acres ‚Äì a portion of an oasis of a fertile land in the rocky soils, is changing the lives of communities. In the perfect adaptation mechanism to the adverse effects of climate change, the farmers in Ngurumani now use simple gravity irrigation to grow vegetables that they export to India.

Masailand is historically dry but elders here say it has become hotter.

Climate scientists say the earth‚Äôs average global surface temperature rose by 0.6¬∞C during the 20th century. Many of them believe there is strong scientific evidence that much of the global warming that has occurred over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities. Emission of greenhouse gases has destabilised the atmosphere and depleted the ozone layer resulting in what known as global warming.

Xavier Baluku Bwanandeke, a resident of the Rwenzori mountain area in Uganda has experienced the effects of global warming first hand.

‚ÄúIn the 1970s I would wake up each morning to view the snow caps on the peaks of Rwenzori Mountain, ‚Äú he says, ‚ÄúThe white sight of snow on top of the mountain would give us joy because this was one of the things that attracted tourists and contributed to the coldness of this land. Today I rarely see the snow and it makes me sad.‚Äù

He says the mountain is no longer as cold as before and the changing weather has brought new challenges.

‚ÄúMosquitoes which were unheard of here are now common and malaria cases have become common. Our coffee is no long yielding as in early 1990s,‚Äô‚Äô says Bwanandeke.

Scientists led by Richard G. Taylor of the Department of Geography, at the University College London in 2006 said the ice cover on the 120km long and 65km wide Rwenzori is drastically receding. By 1906 the ice on the block mountain covered 6.5km but by 2010 it had reduced to 1.6 km. The scientists concluded that the fast receding East African equatorial glaciers will disappear within the next two decades. The study suggests that the increased air temperature resulting from global warming is the main driving force. The loss of these glaciers could have serious consequences for local economies and ecosystems.

Maria Mutagamba, Minister for Water and Environment, says the impact of climate change is manifested in the prolonged drought periods in parts of the country and intensity of floods in ravaging the country. ‚ÄúThese climatic changes are mainly caused by the industrialized nations whose carbon emissions are very destructive to the atmosphere. They need to take responsibility and pay the suffering poor countries,‚Äù Mutagamba said. The minister‚Äôs remarks come days before the UN climate talks under the COP17 in Durban, South Africa. She said Africa deserves climate justice, and support from industrial nations as compensation for global warming.

Failing to adjust

Unlike Kenya, Uganda has up to 65% fertile of land is agricultural with fair amounts of rain. Perhaps as a result, irrigation is unusual even among pastoralist groups like the Karamojong in the semi-arid northeast.

A three year severe drought that ended in 2008 after killing herds of their stock forced some Karimajong to start farming sorghum and maize as an alternative to herding cattle. Those still clinging on to a pastoral nomadic life trek longer distances in search of pasture for their cattle, sheep, and goats. Kotido District Veterinary Officer, Pascal Panvuga says the roaming in the wilderness for pasture puts their stock at risk of attack by wild animals and diseases that are very expensive to treat.

Faced with the reality of the impact of climate change communities and countries are embarking on mitigation measures. Herders at Okiramatian Group Ranch in Kenya‚Äôs Rift Valley Province have devised adaptation mechanisms drawing a time table on which areas to graze from on 3-months rotation. The grazing patterns centre on the rains.

‚ÄúWhen the drought is too much we graze in irrigated areas that have water dams but this is usually time to graze in the highlands. We leave the highlands to recover to graze in the plains,‚Äù says 76 year-old Orumoi Nganga, in Kajiado. The government of Kenya has established a Climate Change Secretariat to coordinate efforts aimed at mitigating climate change effects while the civil society have come together to sensitise the communities to plant more trees. Uganda has established also has Climate Change Unit in the Ministry of Water and Environment to coordinate climate activities and a policy on climate change is being drafted.

However, there is growing demand that industrialized countries which contribute more ozone depleting and global warming activities should do more to help the poor countries that suffer will suffer more cope with climate change. Helping Mbambu predict her weather in Kasese better, would be a good starting point."|https://www.independent.co.ug/fighting-the-floods/
11 dead, 40,000 homes flooded in Louisiana|17/08/2016|"Gonzales, United States | AFP |

The death toll from historic flooding in Louisiana climbed to 11 on Tuesday as the expanding flood zone prompted authorities to declare disasters in 20 parishes of the southeastern US state.

While flooding receded in parts of southern Louisiana, other areas saw rising waters. The National Weather Service issued renewed flood warnings.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing unprecedented flood levels as the waters move south,‚Äù Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said at a news conference.

Officials said 40,000 homes have been impacted by the floods and more than 8,000 people were in shelters.

More than 20,000 have been rescued or evacuated, they said.

Twenty parishes ‚Äî similar to counties in other states ‚Äî were declared emergency disaster areas, up from four on Monday and 12 earlier on Tuesday.

The designation frees up federal money to aid with rescue operations and emergency housing, among other things.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just now moving into recovery phase. We‚Äôre still rescuing in the southern part of the parish,‚Äù said Layton Ricks, the president of Livingston Parish ‚Äî more than 75 percent of which was affected by flooding.

There were reports of looting in areas where homes and businesses were abandoned by fleeing residents.

Many municipalities implemented evening curfews to combat the problem, and to allow rescue crews to move freely at night.

‚ÄúI felt this is the best way to protect our residents,‚Äù said East Baton Rouge Sheriff Sid Gautreaux, adding that 10 people were arrested for looting since Monday afternoon.

People ‚Äòsuffering‚Äô

Edwards said there were still some 34,000 households and businesses without electricity in torrid summer heat and humidity ‚Äî raising concerns of mold in waterlogged buildings.

‚ÄúThere are still a lot of people who are suffering,‚Äù he said.

The Louisiana governor‚Äôs office confirmed to AFP late Tuesday that 11 people had died in the flooding.

Rescue crews were searching for more victims, with officials uncertain about how many people remain missing.

‚ÄúWe are going door to door,‚Äù said Baton Rouge Fire Department Chief Ed Smith, describing a search and rescue process that he estimated could take another five to seven days.

Rescue workers are also searching cars that were inundated or carried away by flood waters.

‚ÄúWe are going to have to search and mark each of those automobiles,‚Äù the governor said.

Ordinary citizens in small boats ‚Äî who in the last few days have earned the title, ‚ÄúCajun navy‚Äù ‚Äî appeared to outnumber formal rescue crews.

Among them were John Booth and Austin Tupper of Baton Rouge. The two men in their 20s had traveled 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast to the hard-hit town of Gonzales, where they were using their private boat to help residents evacuate.

Gonzales flooded only in the last 24 hours, as waters drained south.

70 percent flooded

Vast swaths of southern Louisiana remained under water ‚Äî several feet deep in many places ‚Äî inundating homes, businesses, and cars.

Rick Ramsey, the mayor of Walker ‚Äî a town of 6,000 people east of Baton Rouge ‚Äî told CBS television affiliate WAFB that his town was heavily damaged.

‚ÄúWe are in as good a shape as you can expect with 70 percent of our population flooded,‚Äù Ramsey said.

‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre seeing now is tremendous community spirit,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúPeople are helping each other.‚Äù

The station also broadcast video from inside the city hall building of Denham Springs, also east of Baton Rouge, that showed the flooding had reached chest high before receding.

The number of people staying in shelters is fluctuating, officials said, because some people were leaving while others were entering from newly flooded areas.

Churches were accepting evacuees and donations of food, water and daily living supplies ‚Äî as were many local governments and businesses.

The National Weather Service issued 36 new flood warnings by midday Tuesday for southern Louisiana, as the levels of certain waterways continued to climb and fresh rain fell in a few areas.

Many rivers had begun to recede though, after a weekend storm deluged the region with more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain in some areas, causing waterways to overflow their banks."|https://www.independent.co.ug/11-dead-40000-homes-flooded-louisiana/
Police warns on floods and goons|19/04/2016|"Due to increased rainfall around the country, Uganda Police has advised everyone to be cautious, avoid pools of water and install lightning arresters, to avoid tragedy.

‚ÄúMotorcyclists shouldn‚Äôt maneuver through flooded waters. If the waters are above the knees, wait for the water to subside because you don‚Äôt see where you are moving,‚Äù Director of Fire and Rescue Services, Joseph Mugisa told the press Monday in Kampala

He advised that ‚Äúschools ought to delay students at school in case it is raining.‚Äù

Mugisa also urged parents to dissuade children from playing in pools of water such as drainages, gutters and trenches. Public buildings especially schools should install lightening arresters to prevent lightning accidents from the strikes.

Mugisa said that due to the implementation of emergency response teams in the Rwenzori region, no lives have been lost so far especially around the river banks of Nyamwamba and Mubuku. He revealed that an early warning mechanism from mountains to municipal (passing information from commander Centre to local leadership about the rains) has worked successful in Kasese to prevent loss of lives.

Kampala has been hard hit.

Some of the flood prone areas in the city include low lying areas of Kyambogo, Kinawataka, Banda, Clock Tower around about, Bwaise, Kyebando, and Nalukolongo. Fortunately the police have provided standby teams of divers with inflatable boards, to provide assistance in case of any emergency. They can be contacted on 0711042193, 0800199399 and 0800121222.

Police investigating Goons

The Police are investigating a suspected group of civilians who assaulted a few motorcyclists along Kampala Road, ‚Äòallegedly operating on police duty‚Äô to keep order as Col. Kizza Besigye moved to Najjanakumbi.

The assault happened last Tuesday 12th April 2016, when a group of ‚Äòcivilians‚Äô masked and dressed in black with batons hit moving motorcyclists, and others fled for their life and left the motorcyclists behind.

‚ÄúThere was an infiltration of police operation. However video footages were retrieved and several officers who participated in the operation have recorded statements. The public shouldn‚Äôt judge us and we would like to reassure the public that this fault line that is being worked on,‚Äù Fred Enanga, Police Spokesperson assured journalists at Naguru Police Head Quarters today.

The Police are calling upon the assaulted motorcyclists to come forward and record statements about the incident. The injured victims will be provided with medical forms. Also more stringent measures, under which officers involved, are closely monitored and supervised to ensure security activities are professionally aligned.

Police warned a group of individuals under the KIFEESI Goons, mobilizing on social media to allegedly provide Col. Dr. Kizza Besigye with security on his way for FDC prayers today. They claim police notification is irrelevant but are prepared to carry any weapons in case of police interference.

‚ÄúIt is unlawful and we caution against any evil plans to disrupt the prevailing peace and security in the city. Traffic police have been tasked to conduct traffic surveillance and penalize reckless drivers and motorcyclists that block highways that contribute to the disorder of the city,‚Äù Enanga remarked."|https://www.independent.co.ug/police-warns-on-floods-and-goons/
Sudan issues flood warning as Nile rises|11/08/2016|"Khartoum, Sudan | AFP |

Sudanese authorities on Wednesday warned people living near the banks of the Nile to be wary of flooding, after two weeks of heavy rainfall killed dozens across the country.

Authorities said water levels were rising on the Blue Nile along border with Ethiopia after continuous rainfall in that country.

The Blue Nile flows to Khartoum where it meets the White Nile and they become the Nile, which flows into Egypt.

‚ÄúThe Blue Nile is rising because of continuous heavy rainfall in Ethiopia,‚Äù Mohameddin Abu al-Qasim of the interior ministry told AFP.

‚ÄúWe warn residents living on both sides of the Nile to be cautious.‚Äù

The water levels were rising particularly rapidly in the state of Blue Nile bordering Ethiopia, the official news agency SUNA reported.

At least 76 people have been killed due to flooding elsewhere in Sudan, Interior Minister Ismat Abdul-Rahman said last week.

The United Nations aid agencies had warned of flooding in Sudan between July and November this year.

The most affected states are Kassala, Sennar, South Kordofan, West Kordofan and North Darfur, said the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA.

‚ÄúHeavy rain and flooding since early June have affected over 122,000 people and destroyed over 13,000 houses in many parts of Sudan,‚Äù it said in a statement released on Wednesday.

A downpour in August 2013 was the worst to hit Khartoum in 25 years, affecting tens of thousands of people, the UN said.

SIERRA LEONE: 312 dead as mudslides sweep Freetown|15/08/2017|"Freetown, Sierra Leone | AFP | At least 312 people were killed and more than 2,000 left homeless on Monday when heavy flooding hit Sierra Leone‚Äôs capital of Freetown, leaving excavators to pull bodies from rubble and overwhelming the city‚Äôs morgues.

An AFP journalist saw several homes submerged in Regent village, a hilltop community, and corpses floating in the water in the Lumley West area of the city, as the government held an emergency meeting to plan its response to one of the worst natural disasters ever to hit the city.

Red Cross spokesman Patrick Massaquoi told AFP the death toll was 312 but could rise further as his team continued to survey disaster areas in Freetown and tally the number of dead.

Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries in the world, according to UN indicators.

‚ÄúI counted over 300 bodies and more are coming,‚Äù Mohamed Sinneh, a morgue technician at Freetown‚Äôs Connaught Hospital, told AFP, having earlier described an ‚Äúoverwhelming number of dead‚Äù at the facility leaving no space to lay out every body.

Many more of the dead were taken to private morgues, Sinneh said.

Sierra Leone‚Äôs military, police and Red Cross volunteers were meanwhile deployed in an all out effort to locate and rescue citizens trapped in their homes or under rubble.

Images obtained by AFP showed ferocious, churning dark-orange mud coursing down a steep street in the capital, while videos posted by local residents showed people waist- or chest-deep in water trying to cross the road.

The Sierra Leone meteorological department did not issue any warning ahead of the torrential rains to hasten evacuation from the disaster zones, AFP‚Äôs correspondent based in Freetown said.
