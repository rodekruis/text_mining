We must find a permanent solution to the Kasese floods- Museveni|09/07/2020|"President Museveni has said there is need to find a permanent solution to the problem of flash floods that have disturbed the people of Kasese in the past five or so years.

Early this month, locals in Kasese district in Western Uganda woke up to a wave of flash floods after heavy rains that saw four major rivers including Nyamwamba, Mubuku, Nyamughasana and Lhubiriha burst their banks and water spilled into the low land communities.

The running water washed away several bridges, schools, the main health facility in the area, Kilembe Mines hospital washed away whereas huge stones and other boulders caused havoc.

Over 46000 people were affected by the floods.

On Wednesday, the president visited the area to assess the impact of the natural calamity and said there is need to put away politics and find a lasting solution to the problem.

“We may not solve this in one day, but we must agree on the way forward without cheap politics or deceiving people, just facts. We have come in response to the alarm you made. We shall look after the displaced people and support them. But this cannot be a way of life,” Museveni said.

The President also addressed various district leaders at the Kasese District headquarters and apologized to the people of Kasese who he said had stopped to greet him but he could not stop.

“On behalf of the central government, I came to say sorry for what happened here and for the suffering. Some years ago we had the same problem. We came here and worked out a rehabilitation plan. I was told bridges were built, even an embankment to hold the water. Now this water has come and washed away the bridges and the roads. It bypassed the wall and caused more damage,” he noted.

The president said he has written to the Minister of Water and that of the Environment to study what the source of the problem is so that a permanent solution is got.

“My suspicion…God created gravity. You can’t go up and stay there, you must go down. We must deal with the issue of human settlement, some of these hills you see are not for human settlement,” he said.

Using an example of a woman winnowing millet, the president said when a woman winnows millet, the gravity brings the millet down and the wind blows the chaff off.

“Let us use the same science. Let us plant trees on mountaintops. The best way of settling people is encouraging them to engage in commercial agriculture. The question is where and how. They should also engage in the services sector (Shops, tourism, hotels, taxis etc), Industrialization and ICT,” he said.

He urged leaders to normally see ahead of the people they lead and talk to them saying they must have a correct reconstruction plan.

“At first people did not understand the capacity of the NRM. We have handled many disasters including locusts; floods, Ebola, landslides, Marburg, floating Islands and we are handling Coronavirus. I want to thank Ugandans for listening to our message,” he said.

Museveni pledged to send equipment to help clear debris and urged the leaders to sensitize the people and plant trees.

“My appeal and message is that lets work together on a long term settlement plan. Four rivers in a space of 60 miles is wealth. This means one river every ten miles. In Karamoja you go for miles without any river but here it’s a problem. This is an opportunity which is not well handled,” he said.

The Chief Administrative Officer who is also the Chairperson of the Kasese district disaster management Committee Aggrey Muramira Winston said there is an urgent need for relocation and resettlement of all affected persons to safer places and the immediate take-over of the river valley areas by the Uganda Wildlife Authority or National Forest Authority.

He also said there is need for immediate opening up of flood channels in Kasese Town which have been encroached on by individuals.

The meeting was attended by the Minister for Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Refugees Eng. Hillary Onek and his State Minister Musa Echweru, Uganda’s ambassador to China Dr. Crispus Kiyonga, religious and district leaders."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2020/05/21/we-must-find-a-permanent-solution-to-the-kasese-floods-museveni/
FDC urges Ugandans to help victims of Kasese floods|07/07/2020|"The Forum for Democratic Change has expressed deep concern about the devastating state of affairs transpiring in the districts of Kasese and Bundibugyo where over 125,000 people have been displaced by floods.

The party president, Patrick Amuriat said that the affected people who are currently living in camps need immediate response in terms of sanitary ware, food among others.

He said there should be an establishment of tentative medical camps to enable treatment of patients from within the camps since transport has been affected with the broken bridges.

“Unfortunately, this isn’t happening in the Rwenzori Region alone. The same is happening around the shores of all major lakes and rivers in country,”Amuriat said in the statement.

He called upon government agencies to give prompt responses to challenges that have come with the catastrophe.

“Government of Uganda should consider facilitating and equipping the ministry of Disaster Preparedness with a self-sustaining budget to ably handle disasters as and when they occur, in order to avoid the now very common supplementary budgets whenever we are faced with a crisis,”said Amuriat.

Amuriat appealed to all Ugandans to help out the people of Kasese by donating to them relief items during this trying moment.

“We appeal for any kind of humanitarian aid in form of food, warm clothing, blankets or any materials and financial assistance to be channeled through the committee,”he said."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2020/05/27/fdc-urges-ugandans-to-help-victims-of-kasese-floods/

MTN comes to the rescue of Kasese floods victims|06/07/2020|"MTN Uganda through its Corporate Social Responsibility arm, the MTN Foundation has donated Shs. 41 million towards the Kasese floods victims.

The money will be used to buy non-food relief items to support the families that have been displaced.

The devastating floods ensued after River Nyamwamba burst its banks, following the heavy rains that hit the Rwenzori Mountain ranges.

Over 24,760 households with approximately 173,320 people were affected by the flash floods. Almost up to 150 houses were destroyed in Karusandara division while another 92 houses were completely washed away in Nyamwamba and kilembe areas.

The displaced people have sought shelter from nearby churches and school buildings following a directive from Musa Ecweru, the state Minister for Relief and Disaster Preparedness during his visit to the area last week.

While handling over the dummy cheque to the Red Cross and Officials from the office of the Prime Minister, MTN Uganda’s Chief Executive Officer, Wim Vanhelleputte said that facing such a disaster in these unprecedented times when the globe is grappling with the Covid19 pandemic and the country in a state of lock-down, spells double tragedy for the people of Kasese.

Vanhelleputte further expressed MTN’s heartfelt sympathy to the people of Kasese.

“As MTN Uganda, we stand with the people of Kasese who have suffered great loss in the recent heavily destructive flash floods. We understand that this is such a trying time, especially since we are already battling the devastating effects of the Covid19 pandemic. We hope that this modest support we have rendered will offer them some comfort,” he said.

While receiving the cheque, Robert Kwesiga, Uganda Red Cross Secretary General appreciated MTN for always coming through very fast to support whenever the Country has emergences.

“This is not the first time MTN Uganda has supported people affected by disasters. Last year they supported Bududa twice, supported Bundibugyo and today they are supporting Kasese. This consistent commitment is a true humanitarian spirit exhibited by MTN to support it’s community. Amidst this period when all partners including MTN have heavily invested in the COVID-19 fight, MTN has still managed to support Kasese. We want to thank you.” Kwesiga said.

The money shall be used to procure 100 standard household non-food-item kits to reach out to 100 most vulnerable families comprising of children, youths, women and the elderly.

Each of the kits contains 2 cooking pots, 6 cups, 6 plates, 1 knife, 1 ladle, 2 jerry cans, 3 blankets, 3 mosquito nets, 3 bars of soap and 1 tarpaulin for shelter.

In 2013, the MTN foundation spent about Shs 250m to support the kilembe mines hospital which had been affected by similar floods through refurbishment of the children and maternal ward and provided items to support the hospital inclusive of 100 hospital beds, mattresses, mosquito nets as well a generator."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2020/05/11/mtn-comes-to-the-rescue-of-kasese-floods-victims/

Floods bring beach owners more misery in the quarantine|31/03/2020|"Beach owner Freedom Abitekaniza had not worked since March 31, 2020 when President Yoweri Museveni declared a nationwide lockdown to stem the spread of the novel Coronavirus.

In actuality, Abetekaniza says business had started to tapper off at Freedom Beach in Entebbe in the middle of February 2020. This was when the world began to take more serious notice of Coronavirus (Covid-19) that had spread beyond China.

The employer of fourteen says, “Our clients who are from all over the world had already started leaving Uganda when Covid became serious. Those in Uganda were also not sure of what might happen next.”

In spite of that challenge, Abitekaniza says he had continued to pay his employees, four of whom are permanent staff at the Entebbe beach that is in Katabi town council.

But he could not anticipate the difficulties ahead that were unleashed when President Museveni declared a freeze on all unnecessary movement March 31. President Museveni dramatically explaining, “We need total silence in the country so we can find out where the disease is coming from.”

For Abitekaniza trying to meet the needs of clients to his beach who enjoy delicacies like fried fish, the challenges were almost immediate. “The first time I tried to use my motorbike to deliver an order, I was arrested in Abaita Ababiri. I had to bribe to get my bike back.”

He says, “When the president ordered a lockdown, it was a surprise. We are law abiding citizens and are complying. But we were all locked down where we were. I have three workers who have had to stay here on site at Freedom Beach yet they have their own homes. They cannot move, like other Ugandans.”

Abitekaniza, who also manages Palace Inn in Nkumba, along Entebbe road and Sunset Motel, says, “I also have three workers who are staying at Palace Inn. I have been left with the duty to feed them and help their families. They are all looking to me and I cannot let them down because they have never let me down when I asked them to do their work. The expenditure is too much and there is no income.”

However, as if the misery of being unable to work for the Freedom Beach establishment which has been open since 2007 is not enough, it has been suffering continual floods. Since Lake Victoria started overflowing its banks in March 2020, Freedom Beach has been one of the most battered.

Abitekaniza says he has decided to wait out the rainy season before he can think of rebuilding the artistic and cosy shelters that Freedom Beach has long been famous for.

The ravaging floods have continually broken the barriers Abitekaniza had built up. A significant percentage of Freedom Beach is now underwater, as indeed are many establishments along Lake Victoria, as of writing this piece."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2020/05/14/floods-bring-beach-owners-more-misery-in-the-quarantine/

“The rain also left Rivers such as Nyalulu and other small streams flooded after bursting their banks. The main Fort Portal- Bundibugyo road and Nyahuka-Nudibugyo roads completely destroyed as well as other roads connecting from the town council. Houses, latrines, crop gardens, places of worship, and Cocoa gardens were also submerged,” Nakasiita said in a statement.

She said that a total of 12 sub-counties were adversely affected, with Harugale and Busaru the most affected.

Nakasiita explained that a joint team of police, military, and Red Cross is currently deployed as the search for more dead bodies and survivors is going on.

“The Uganda Police and Military officials were on ground to join hands with the Red Cross and the community members to support the rescue mission. Uganda Red Cross and government through the office of the Prime minister are mobilizing relief to support the affected persons,” she added.

According to the Uganda Red Cross Society spokesperson, after recovering 16 dead bodies, they suspect many more are still missing but said impassable roads have made it difficult to reach some areas.

“Some of the missing bodies could not be retrieved at all whereas some of the victims were too far on mountain tops. There wasn’t enough food to serve to the people that have been sheltered at the churches and schools,” Nakasiita noted.

“Our teams remain committed to supporting all the people affected despite being constrained with resources.

Rugby: Heathens, Buffaloes meet in another floodlights clash|26/02/2018|"Thomas Odongo

The opening match of the second round of this season’s national rugby premier league will witness Kyadondo Rugby Club based pair of Heathens and Buffaloes lock horns under the floodlights on Friday night.

The 8PM clash, a match day 10 fixture will be the fourth rugby union match played at night at Kyadondo since the idea was incepted with Heathens and Kobs locking horns during the season opener.

It is also the second time Heathens and Buffaloes meet at night this season.

The clash is also the third time the two teams play under the floodlights with Heathens having played Kobs whilst Buffaloes hosting Pirates last Friday.

During their previous clash, Heathens full back Joseph Oyet ran the show off two tries, a penalty and a conversion and was named man of the match as the cup holders claimed a 25-00 win against Buffaloes.

Heathens are the only perfect team in the top tier league so far and boast with 43 points on top of the summit whilst Buffaloes sitting at the fifth position with 22 points.

Heathens will be eager to open the second round with a bang but Buffaloes will not easily throw in the towel as they seek to make amends for their 10-15 loss against Black Pirates during the previous night game.

A win for Heathens will imply that they maintain a 100% winning rate in night rugby union games while Buffaloes will be winless in the night breeze."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2020/02/20/rugby-heathens-buffaloes-meet-in-another-floodlights-clash/
The AU Commission to support flood-hit Beledweyne with $87,000 worth of relief|29/06/2020|"The Head of African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) Ambassador Francisco Madeira visited Beledweyne on Saturday where he said that the African Union Commission will soon provide relief support amounting

to US$87,000 in the form of medical supplies and non-food items.

Beledweyne, in the Hirshabelle State of Somalia, was devastated by heavy rains and flooding which destroyed houses, crops, roads and displaced thousands of families.

Ambassador Madeira also conveyed a message of solidarity and goodwill from the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Musa Faki.

“The Chairperson of the African Union Commission has instructed me to tell the population of Beledweyne that the African Union is with Hiran, Beledweyne and the whole population at this moment. I had the opportunity to go through the city, and I saw the devastation that the floods have caused,” Ambassador Madeira said.

The Head of AMISOM also commended AMISOM Sector 4 personnel for their tireless efforts in distributing relief items as well in conducting search and rescue operations during the humanitarian crisis.

After seeing some of the affected areas, Ambassador Madeira held meetings with the deputy president of Hirshabelle State, Ali Hussein Guudlaawe, the Governor of Hiran region, Ali Mohamed Arale and high-ranking officers from the Somali National Army, where they discussed the humanitarian and security needs of the state.

He also took the opportunity to introduce to the Hirshabelle deputy president the new AMISOM Police Commissioner, Assistant Inspector General of Police Augustine Magnus Kailie, and the new Deputy Force Commander, Logistics and Support Maj. Gen. George Owinow who both recently joined the mission.

“I promised vice president Ali Hussein that AMISOM police and the military will continue to work with the Hirshabelle security forces in order for us to protect the population and do the best we can to open the main supply routes towards Fidow and Jowhar, until Mogadishu”.

He said opening the main supply routes was important in linking Hirshabelle towns as well as to facilitate the movement of people, goods and services.

Hirshabelle’s deputy president Ali Hussein expressed gratitude to AMISOM for its support.

“We have discussed the dire needs of the people in Beledweyne, Bula-burde, Jalalaqsi, Mahaday, Jowhar and Bal’ad towns that were affected by the floods. We appreciate AMISOM’s solidarity and support and we are ready to lead every effort aimed at helping these people. After this emergency, we would like to come up with

durable solutions to mitigate the devastation caused by recurring floods in Beledweyne and Hiran region”, the deputy president said.

The Minister of State for Finance (Planning), Hon David Bahati who was responding to a Shs43 billion request from the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness, said that all that money cannot be released immediately.

“Not all the money is needed now. We shall avail the shs20 million in the next two days,” Bahati said.

Bahati’s commitment follows a report by the Minister of State for Disaster Preparedness, Hon Musa Ecweru during plenary sitting on 26 November 2019.

Ecweru said there is need for an urgent response to 38,000km of district roads, 98,000km of urban roads and 79,000km of village access roads which have been destroyed by floods. He added that 20 bridges require overhaul.

“The above normal rain has caused water logging in many villages causing huge post-harvest destruction. Affected population of over eight million requires immediate shelter and relief food. Twenty districts are most prone to waterborne diseases,” said Ecweru.

He added that the impact of flooding is highest in the regions of Bugisu, Teso, Bukedi, Kigezi and Rwenzori as well as the districts of Ntoroko, Bundibugyo and Kasese.

“Eighty five per cent of the population in these regions and districts are facing severe losses of livelihoods in addition to destruction of commonly used infrastructure. The Bugisu region has experienced landslides in addition to flooding,” he said.

The Minister of State for Health, Hon Sarah Opendi advised the Minsiterfor Disaster to identify priority areas so that the funds are properly utilised.

“The ministry should explain to the House the identified priority areas because it looks like the bulk of the money will go to roads,” she said.

The Speaker, Rebecca Kadaga advised the ministry to involve the district disaster committees while identifying priority areas.

“The minister should prepare a schedule of the priority areas and report to the House tomorrow,” said Kadaga.

Legislators raised concern over the distribution of the funds saying that the ministry should ensure that all affected regions are covered.

Hon. Barnabas Tinkasimire (Ind. Buyaga West County) pointed out that there should be no repeat of reports where the Minister for Disaster was accused of misusing funds.

Hon. Hellen Asamo (NRM, PWDs Eastern) called for affirmative action for Persons With Disabilities (PWDs) while distributing relief.

“PWDs miss out because distribution of relief items is characterised by struggles which we cannot engage in,” she said.

In October this year, the Meteorogical Department forecast that the country would experience above-normal rains between the months of September and December."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2019/11/27/govt-to-release-shs20-billion-for-emergency-response-to-floods/
Brace for floods, landslides for next 3 months as heavy rains begin, government warns|09/07/2020|"Government has warned its citizens in several parts of the country to get ready for floods and landslides due to heavy rains that have begun.

“In the coming days; massive floods and landslides are expected in the sub-regions of Elgon, Rwenzori and Kigezi . Most parts of the country will experience strong winds and lightening 4. People should not be caught unprepared,”Owor said in a statement.

According to the Office of the Prime Minister, people living near river banks and on steep slopes should shift to homes of relatives and friends in safer locations whereas those near drainage channels should clear them.

“People should reinforce their roofs and walls where necessary. They are strongly advised not to walk or to allow a driver or boda boda-rider take them through flooded roads or bridges even if when the floods appear very low below the knees or rim of the car. 9. It takes only about 15 minutes for most flash-floods to clear,” government advised.

“It is advisable that one waits until the flash-floods have cleared. Store enough food and firewood to last three months. Take extra care of children, the elderly and other vulnerable persons, over the next three months.”

The development comes barely a week after heavy rains pounded Kisoro in the areas of Gakoro and Ntarama in Sooko parish in Muramba sub-county on Saturday.

“The emergency will be in three phases, life saving phase, recovery phase and development,” Ecweru added.

In addition minister Ecweru also said, as part of life saving Interventions, government will be procure Inflatable Boats, Tarpaulins, Blankets, Relief food, drug for waterborne diseases and culverts for fixing washed bridges.

These will be implemented between November and January, 2020.

Besides efforts to establish the missing number of persons have been undertaken with village registers roll calls in the affected areas in Bududa District.

It has equally been established that over 4000 people were affected in the said Disasters in Sironko District.

As a mitigation measure, government has issued alert warnings to its citizens amidst disaster not to allow bodaboda and other motorists to transport them through flooded and disaster hit zones for their safety.

How Police’s most experienced diver died during a floods rescue mission|09/07/2020|"The police force is mourning the death of one of its most experienced divers who passed on over the weekend during a rescue mission in the city.

Sergeant Godfrey Mwondha, 32 a marine officer with the Uganda Police Force died in the floods that ravaged Kampala city on Saturday after a heavy downpour as he went to save someone

According to police spokesperson, Fred Enanga, the incident happened on Saturday in Mbuya when two marine police officers responded to a call for service regarding a person who had drowned.

“When Mwondha went into the water to save the victim, his leg was trapped in a hole and he suffocated as he took in a lot of water during the process,”Enanga said.

The police mouthpiece said, after several minutes inside water, the police diver was pulled out and rushed to Kitintale hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Having joined the force in 2009, Enanga said Mwondha was one of the most experienced divers that the Police force has noting that they have lost a great asset.

“He was a highly skilled diver who had rescued many victims from water but was also one of the most experienced divers the force had.”

He noted that considering the resources and time the force had spent in training him, they have lost a great asset as the marine department of the Police Force.

Bundibugyo floods hero Hannington Agaba refuses to let viral fame go to his head|08/12/2019|"As news spread like wildfire that landslides in Bundibugyo were claiming lives and property as roads and homesteads were also cut off, along with it came the pictures of a man rescuing people who were trapped by floods. I managed to locate Corporal Hannington Agaba, a Uganda Wildlife Authority community conservation officer at Kirumya wildlife offices.

Agaba is based in Semliki National Park.

Agaba explains how he came to put his life at risk to save others, “I was coming from an outreach. It had not rained here but it had rained in the mountains the previous day. When it rains in the mountains even if it doesn’t rain here, water always comes. So, all of sudden I hear screams and I see water levels going up quite fast and trapping people. I had to enter the water and save those helpless children and women.”

Corporal Agaba would end up saving the lives of more than 30 stranded people as he waded through water sometimes upto his waist.

To the locals here, Agaba is a celebrated local hero who not only has made a name in rescuing lives in danger but also conserving the environment. Consistently, he engages the communities on peaceful existence with nature and this has earned him a name here.

As the world watched and wondered where the other men in uniform were as lives were lost in other parts of the district, Agaba was not paying attention to who was doing what. The youthful conservation officer says patriotism, dedications and doing the right thing rather than blame games is his DNA

He attributes all to how, “I was trained to serve. Patriotism guides me and all I care about is serving my country in whatever way.”

While he is at the centre of an adoration frenzy, Agaba is not moved by his recent status despite the fact that, “People have been calling, my phone is full of messages and am really thankful that the media took my gesture positively but that has not changed my character. I will keep conserving the environment, helping people and making Uganda better. That is what I stand for, not the ranks, not the publicity or media buzz about me.”

Floods leave thousands homeless in Chad and Cameroon|21/05/2020|"Heavy rains and floods this week have left at least 100,000 people homeless on both sides of the border between northern Cameroon and Chad. It’s the worst flooding in the area since 2012. the military is working to evacuate those stranded by floodwaters in Kaikai.

Heavy rains have been pouring ceaselessly, destroying houses and farms in the northern Cameroon village of Kaikai over the past two weeks.

Residents say the downpours caused Lake Maga and the Logone River to overflow.

41-year-old Kaikai resident and cattle rancher Blaise Yunussa said he has lost his two houses and does not know where his goats, fowls and cattle are.

“Everything is damaged and so many inhabitants lost their houses. Many of our crops have been destroyed, that is why we are here. Maybe his excellency Paul Biya will try to help us,” he said.

Effects of floods in Kaikai village, northern Cameroon (M. Edwin Kindzeka/VOA)

Local officials say the flooding has affected 70,000 people in Cameroon and 30,000 across the border in Chad, where the Logone River broke its banks on October 1.

Makon ma Makon, the highest government official in the Maga administrative unit, said many of the victims are seeking refuge with relatives in safer localities while others are still trapped in hard-to-reach areas and are lacking basic goods, including water and food.

He said he has recommended that the central government in Yaounde should take immediate action to save the lives of the people because the situation is catastrophic and that while waiting he has ordered health officials under his command to provide first aid to those in need.

Cameroon’s military deployed earlier this week to assist the needy.

Roads are inundated and access to most villages is by boat. Some bridges have been damaged, but no deaths have been reported.

Lawmaker Julien Bara, who hails from the area, visited flood victims lodged in public buildings, churches and mosques.

Bara said it is deplorable especially as children will not be able to go to school soon since some of their schools have been destroyed. He said he has visited the victims to make an appraisal of their immediate needs and inform the government that has to take immediate action to help suffering people.

The worst floods in northern Cameroon claimed 60 lives in 2012 when heavy rainfall persisted in the area for over a month.

Residents say if the current floods persist, people displaced by the flooding and Boko Haram terrorism will be hugely affected.

Brace for floods as rains persist, weather experts warn Kampala residents|09/07/2020|"The Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA) has warned members of the public to brace for more rains and floods in the coming months.

“Heavy rains with lightning and thunder are expected to prevail over most parts of the country within the next five days. These rains are expected to bring about flooding especially in the urban areas and low lying areas , mudslides in the mountainous areas and lighting strikes coupled with strong winds,” Paul Isabirye, said the UNMA acting Executive Director.

A number of areas in Kampala have always flooded after heavy rains and if the warning by the Uganda National Meteorological Authority is to go by, residents in Uganda’s capital should brace for the worst.

According to the weather experts, the current rains are the peak seasons for September, October, November and December rainy season for this year which is attributed to the rain-belt which is over Uganda.

They said the rain is also attributed to the moist winds blowing from the Indian Ocean and the Congo forests.

“Please take note that Tuesday 29 and Wednesday 30 October are expected to have even more rainfall within this forecast period.”

According to UNMA, areas most likely to be affected are those found in the Southern and Western regions, particularly Kigezi highlands, Rwenzori mountain ranges and parts of central region, especially around Lake Victoria.

Caution

The weather experts have however warned motorists to be wary of poor visibility resulting from heavy rain conditions which might cause accidents.

“All motorists and pedestrians are therefore encouraged to take utmost care to minimize accidents that may result from such weather conditions.”

Somalia struggles after worst flooding in recent history|29/06/2020|"Ahmed Sabrie woke up to find his house half-submerged in fast-rising flood waters.

Frightened and confused, he herded sleepy family members onto the roof of their home in central Somalia as scores of thousands of people in the town, Beledweyne, scrambled for their lives. Clinging to an electric power pylon by the edge of the roof, the family watched as their possessions were washed away.

“I could hear people, perhaps my neighbors, screaming for help but I could only fight for the survival of my family,” the 38-year-old Sabrie, the father of four, recalled. As one of his children wailed, the family waited for more than 10 hours before a passing rescue boat spotted them.

An aerial view of the flooded Hiran region of central Somalia, Nov. 12, 2019. Somalia’s recent flooding is the latest reminder that the nation must prepare for extremes predicted to come with climate change.

Death toll unknown

Authorities have not yet said how many people died in the flooding last month, Somalia’s worst in recent history and the latest reminder that the Horn of Africa nation must prepare for the extremes expected to come with a changing climate.

At least 10 people went missing when their boat capsized after the Shabelle river burst its banks. Local officials have said at least 22 people in all are presumed dead and the toll could rise.

“This is a catastrophic situation,” Mayor Safiyo Sheikh Ali said. President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who visited the town and waded through submerged areas, called the devastation “beyond our capacity” and pleaded for more help from aid groups.

With no proper emergency response plan for natural disasters, local rescuers used rickety wooden dhows to reach trapped people while helicopters provided by the United Nations plucked people from rooftops. African Union and Somali forces have joined the rescue operations and the Somali government airlifted food.

“Many people are still trapped in their submerged houses and we have no capacity and enough equipment to cover all areas,” said Abdirashakur Ahmed, a local official helping to coordinate rescue operations. Hundreds are thought to still be stuck.

Children displaced by recent floods reach the outskirts of the town of Beledweyne in central Somalia, Nov. 4, 2019.

More rain, flooding

With more heavy rains and flash flooding expected, officials warned thousands of displaced people against returning too quickly to their homes.

More than 250,000 people across Somalia were displaced by the recent severe flooding, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council.

Beledweyne town was the worst affected. Several thousand people were sheltering under trees or in tents.

“Floods have destroyed more than three-quarters of Beledweyne and submerged many surrounding villages,” said Victor Moses, the NRC’s country director.

Aid groups said farms, infrastructure and roads in some areas were destroyed. The destruction of farmland near rivers is expected to contribute to a hunger crisis.

To better prepare for “major climate-induced shocks” such as flooding and drought that Somalia already faces every two to five years, the country and the U.N. Development Program this week launched a $10 million project to expand weather monitoring resources and train a largely rural population in water conservation and flood management.

The possibility of further damage from heavy rains in the coming days remains a concern, according to the International Organization for Migration.

Parts of the Lower Juba, Gedo and Bay regions, where IOM has supported displaced populations for years, have been affected. Many displaced people were stranded without food, latrines or shelter.

“In Baidoa, people have moved to high ground where they are in immediate need of support,” said Nasir Arush, the minister for humanitarian and disaster management for South West State.

Survivors like Sabrie now must struggle to rebuild their lives.

Flooding has become more serious in recent days. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement that the situation is “extremely concerning.”

The floods have limited people’s access to healthcare facilities, nutrition centers and other basic necessities.

The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) also estimated that about 490,000 children were affected by the flooding. An estimated 908,000 people have been affected overall.

Rains are likely to continue for another four to six weeks, putting more people at risk.

Many of the affected people were already facing high humanitarian needs before the flooding. More than 60% of the population are facing malnutrition.

African billionaire puts African migration to Europe in perspective, less than Asian flood|06/01/2020|"The migration of Africans to Europe and North America should be viewed as a positive phenomenon, not a threat, Sudan-born billionaire Mo Ibrahim said Sunday.

Experts said at a weekend conference hosted by Ibrahim’s foundation in Abidjan, Ivory Coast that Africans make up about 14% of the global migrant population, a much smaller share than the 41% from Asia and 23% from Europe.

“Migration is healthy. It’s not a disease,” Ibrahim told The Associated Press in an interview. “Migration is about aspirations, not desperation. People who migrate are mostly capable, ambitious young people who are migrating to work and to build successful lives. They add wealth to the countries they go to.”

Ibrahim also cited statistics to rebut anti-migration politicians who say Africans have inundated Europe.

“Europe is not being flooded by Africans,” Ibrahim said, citing statistics that show 70% of African migrants relocate within Africa.

The 72-year-old philanthropist earned his fortune by establishing the Celtel mobile phone network across Africa.

Now living in Britain, he says African countries should have better education and employment opportunities for their young.

“Farming should be sexy. It should be seen as profitable and productive, not a backward thing,” said Ibrahim. “Yes, IT and technology are important, but agriculture is a way of the future for Africa.”

Substandard radiology machines flood market|24/07/2008|"Radiology operators in Easter region have complained that Uganda has become a dumping ground for old radiology equipment which expose recipients and operators to ionising radiation and its devastating effects.

In Uganda, ionizing radiation is popularly applied in medical services including CT scans, X-rays, Radiotherapy, nuclear medicine among others, which have become lucrative in the recent days.

These according to experts are a necessary evil which can have devastating effects on humans and the environment if necessary protection and safety measures are not put in place.

This came out clearly during a meeting organised by the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) for radiologists in eastern Uganda.

Some of the participants noted that they are compelled by their profit oriented employers to operate such dangerous equipment.

They appealed to the regulatory body to tighten the noose on importation of substandard equipment in a bid to protect the citizens from exposure.

Noah Deogratias Luwalira, the chief executive officer of AEC noted that the regulatory body has shut down several facilities across the country for noncompliance on safety standards.

He noted that the regulatory body is incapacitated from effectively handling its regulatory work by technology, funding and staffing gaps, adding that necessary steps are being undertaken to bridge the gaps.

“We don’t have all the resources that we need to do our work, but these problems are being resolved gradually. We are gradually acquiring equipment and building the human capacity to handle regulatory work in the nuclear energy sector,” he said.

Luwalira said that there is an ongoing massive awareness initiative to sensitise the public on the dangers and benefits and risks of ionising atomic radiation technology.

He said: “We are doing a mass sensitisation of the different stake holder so that people know the dangers and benefits arising from the use of this technology which is inevitable if we are to develop as a country.”

He urged people to always insist on being shown a certificate from AEC at radiology facilities in Uganda.

Effects of ionising radiation include cancer, hereditary effects, sterility, gene mutation, among other.

The Atomic Energy Council is mandated by the Atomic Energy act No 24 of 2008 to regulate, issue guidelines and increase awareness on safety and protection from ionising radiation."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2019/04/23/substandard-radiology-machines-flood-market/
Floods ravage Butaleja district after “engineers” steal early warning system solar panels|15/06/2020|"Over 19 homesteads have been displaced in Kanyenya parish following floods that destroyed homes and gardens in several villages in Himutu and neighbouring sub-counties.

The floods are attributed to huge volumes of water descending from Mt. Elgon.

Affected families have been advised to temporarily relocate to safer grounds such as schools and worship centres.

Relief and Disaster Preparedness minister, Musa Ecweru who visited the areas pledged support to the affected families.

The floods that lasted four days affected houses and crops indiscriminately.

“The whole house is soaked, we have nowhere to sleep. Our gardens have been submerged, beans are just rotting in the garden,” lamented one of the affected persons in Masula “A” village, Kanyenya parish.

Affected families say they were taken by surprise.

The early warning systems which were established by government to alert the community ahead of any tragedy have been vandalized by unidentified individuals who made off with the solar panels leaving the equipment with no power supply.

A resident sadly said, “It used to alert us even at night and we ran to safer places, but now the water comes unnoticed.”

The floods occur when there is a sudden overflow from Mt Elgon. The water table does not depend on the rain in Butaleja so even if it has not rained, there can be floods. This makes it difficult for the community to detect danger.

The LC1 chairperson Masula “A” village, Wabaye Mesulamu revealed that the equipment has been defunct since 2016. He believes the engineers who installed the equipment could have a clue on how the solar panels disappeared.

“There is a time they visited the control room in the guise of testing the equipment but I saw them with ladders. Their intention was maybe was to disorganize the control room and take the panels.”

The minister condemned the act adding that the equipment cost the taxpayer collosal sums of shillings. He pledged to send a team of engineers to restore the system ahead of the looming heavy and destructive rains.

“The metrology department has told us that the rains delayed to come and they are picking up in June,” said Ecweru adding that, the rains will to be destructive.

Sudan has been hit by torrential rains since the start of July, affecting nearly 200,000 people in at least 15 states across the country including the capital Khartoum.

The worst affected area is the White Nile state in the south.

Flooding of the Nile river remains “the biggest problem”, SUNA said, citing a health ministry official.

On Friday the United Nations said 54 people had died due to the heavy rains.

It said more than 37,000 homes had been destroyed or damaged, quoting figures from the government body it partners with in the crisis response.

“Humanitarians are concerned by the high likelihood of more flash floods,” the UN said, adding that the rainy season was expected to last until October.

The floods are having a lasting humanitarian impact on communities, with cut roads, damaged water points, lost livestock and the spread of water-borne diseases by insects.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said an extra $150 million were needed from donors to respond to surging waters, in addition to the $1.1 billion required for the overall humanitarian situation in Sudan."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2019/08/26/sudan-flood-death-toll-reaches-62/
River Mayanja bursts its banks, floods maroon hundreds of residents (VIDEO)|18/11/2018|"Paul Kayonga

Sunday, November 18, 2018 will live in the memory of many residents along the northern bypass as one of the worst of the year. After a heavy Saturday night downpour that went on intermittently into daybreak, residents of areas like Kalerwe, Kawempe, Kyebando, Kasangati and Kawanda found the roads flooded.

The overwhelming water did not stop at the roads but seeped into many homes and business premises ruining livelihoods and threatening lives.

To add onto their woes, River Mayanja burst it its banks.

The roads were slippery, water logged and dangerous to wade through. Only brave young men at the price of 1000 to 2000 shillings were daring to wade into the water to help desperate men, women, and children make the perilous crossing.

Cars were on the average taking four to five hours to cross between Kawempe and Matugga.

The downpour is part of the end of year seasonal rains. Uganda is bracing for more."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2018/11/19/river-mayanja-bursts-its-banks-floods-maroon-hundreds-of-residents-video/
Mbale flooded with fake goods|11/05/2020|"GERALD MATEMBU

Mbale has turned into a dumping ground for fake goods, Dr Abdul Ndifuna, the regional Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS) boss has revealed.

Ndifuna said tonnes of fake products have so far been impounded from shops within Mbale town following an operation across the region recently.

Toothpaste, cosmetics, and soft drinks are among the impounded goods. The fake items are said to have originated from Kampala following a crackdown on the perpetrators there.

Ndifuna made the revelation during a meeting organised by wholesale traders to tackle some of the bottlenecks encountered in the course of doing business.

The traders told Ndifuna that they are counting losses due to underweight commodities such as sugar and bread.

He urged the traders and the public to alert the standards body’s regional offices in Mbale in case they come across fake goods.

Ndifuna noted that the regional team is overwhelmed by the wide area of coverage. The regional office covers 38 districts across the eastern corridor."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2018/10/12/mbale-flooded-with-fake-goods/
Kampala Floods: Water never forgets its path|29/06/2020|"Mohamed Kimbugwe

Whenever floods hit this city, everyone comes up with an opinion on the matter, including some of the craziest opinions I’ve ever heard.

Let’s now get to the bottom of this matter. The earth is contoured in such a way that it has high points and low points. The lowest points (valleys) form a natural and perfectly interconnected drainage system and water catchment area.

Disruption of that system, which is as old as the city itself is the major cause of our flooding problems. Can the problem be solved? Well, we shall see later, but let’s first look at some examples.

The whole of the greater Bwaise area is a water catchment area that receives water from places as far as Matugga.

This may sound funny, but you just have to take a look at the contours and you’ll be shocked.

Bwaise is meant to hold water, while letting some of it off through Nabweeru to Lubigi and in turn to the greater Busega – Kyengera – Kabojja water catchment area.

The cost of perfectly draining Bwaise is two times the value of all the developments in Bwaise. Infact, Bwaise requires reclamation.

The Kitante Golf course, Garden City and the neighbouring Nakumatt building sit in the path of another catchment area that is meant to drain Mulago, Kololo, Nakasero and parts of Wandegeya.

This catchment would then let off some water through Industrial Area to the greater #Bugolobi water catchment and eventually to Lake Victoria. Kati Kati, Lugogo Mall and Game sit in another catchment area meant to drain parts of Kololo, Naguru and Bukoto.

This would eventually let off some water through Kyadondo Rugby Grounds – Industrial Area and eventually to the now dilapidated Namuwongo water catchment area and Lake Victoria.

Ntinda, Kyambogo and surrounding areas are naturally supposed to be drained through Spear Motors and the surrounding industrial area, all the way to the Kinawattaka catchment. That the natural system is gone, we are faced with two scenarios.

Foremost, the natural system perfectly regulates water flow and speed, absorbs huge amounts of water at some points and even purifies the water to acceptable levels before it gets to the Lake.

That we have lost, because an artificial system that can come close to that is very costly.

That therefore means that we need a properly designed artificial drainage system that closely mimics the natural one.

That is a long-term intervention and while we think about it, we must focus on short-term remedies.

We must jealously secure what is left of our wetlands and the natural water paths by not allowing any physical developments there, save for cases where the developer can invest in a perfect artificial drainage system.

We must connect flooded areas to the nearest natural catchment, using artificial channels.

We must unblock roadside drainage channels, given that 90% of them are chocked with soil.

This also means that dirt swept from the streets must be disposed of as opposed to piling it by the roadsides, which ends up blocking drainage channels.

We must come up with a comprehensive drainage plan and start working around funding it in phases, however expensive that may be.

This includes investing in artificial water catchments in problem areas like Bwaise, where storm water would be collected, treated and pumped for domestic, agricultural and industrial use.

Uganda Struggles to promote local sugar as imports flood market|28/03/2019|"Even with a 100 % tax imposed on imported sugar, Uganda Revenue Authority continues to collect more taxes from the importation of sugar. According to Vincent Sseruma the head of public and corporate affairs at URA, over 242 million shillings have been collected inform of taxes in the last seven months. But following the presidential directive to close some Sugar warehouses, there is fear that the taxman might lose revenue.

Information from Uganda Revenue Authority show that as of July 2018 businessmen have imported over 986,181 kilograms of sugar mainly from India, Brazil and China of which 45,719,199 kilograms is being kept in different warehouses.

This has forced the president to order for the immediate closure of sugar bonds, arguing that the existence of such bonds, have left the neighbouring countries sceptical of Uganda’s capacity to supply the East African region with enough sugar.

Uganda Revenue Authority head of public and corporate affairs, Vincent Seruma says different types of sugar are imported into the country.

“Ugandan imports industrial sugar used in factories and then the regular sugar and this all is kept in bonds.” Says sseruma vincent

But even though the country is benefiting in form of taxes, President Yoweri Museveni is determined to protect local industries.

But according to Sseruma bonds are by law under customs and a part from the industrial sugar that isn’t manufactured in the country, the ordinary sugar imported in Uganda is 100% taxed with an additional 5% excise duty on each kilo of sugar.

“The aim of this tax is limit importation of sugar which competes with local manufacturers, we only don’t tax industry sugar “seruma noted

Most of the imported sugar ends up in multiple bonded warehouses found in Ntinda and along the Naguru stretcher road. These include export traders bond, Liberty bond found in Namanve, inward Africa along 6th street in Industrial area and shumuk in Kyambogo, which re-export sugar to Rwanda, South Sudan and DRC.

“Uganda has positioned its self has a business hub and most traders store their goods here and look for market”

President Museveni order follows a recent move by the Tanzanian Government to slap an illegal 25% import duty on Ugandan sugar following uncertainties surrounding its originality."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2018/09/07/uganda-struggles-to-promote-local-sugar-as-imports-flood-market/
Hundreds dead as floods wreak havoc in East Africa|21/05/2020|"Weeks of torrential rain after a long drought have turned from blessing to curse in East Africa, killing hundreds of people and displacing hundreds of thousands of others.

In Kenya, which had suffered from three failed rainy seasons, 120 people have died in two months, including eight who were swept off a bridge in a flashflood Thursday night outside the capital, witnesses said.

The Red Cross appealed for $5 million (four million euros) to help those affected.

Since early March, “112 people have lost their lives countrywide,” Red Cross Secretary General Abbas Gullet told a press conference Friday, not including Thursday night’s incident.

Flooding has washed away bridges and homes, with the military airlifting residents from submerged houses in some parts of the country.

“About 48,177 households have been displaced so far and this translates to 260,200 people,” Gullet said.

He said over 21,000 acres (8,500 hectares) of crops had been destroyed and some 20,000 animals washed away.

On Monday the government announced that up to 100 schools would not open for the second term due to flooding.

Somalia, also struck by a severe drought, has received heavy rains and the south-central town of Beledweyne was engulfed by flood waters after the Shabelle river burst its banks.

The peacekeeping force AMISOM stepped in to evacuate some 10,000 residents, according to its Twitter account.

President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed visited the district on Tuesday.

“I came here to Beledweyne to share with you the pain and hardships caused by the devastating floods, I know that there are more than 100,000 people displaced from their homes because of the floods and many others still stranded inside town,” he said.

– Food prices to rise –

Several other major towns along the river have also been affected and local NGO worker Abdulahi Liban told AFP there were concerns of water-borne diseases breaking out.

Rwanda has also been seriously affected by the deluge. Its ministry of disaster management said 116 people had died and 207 had been injured in flooding and landslides since January.

The ministry said floods had destroyed 120 houses, 23 roads, seven churches, and killed 705 livestock while also destroying 11,300 acres of crops.

Torrential rains have also hit Tanzania, where 14 people died in April, as well as Uganda where flash floods have destroyed homes and left at least three dead, according to police in both countries.

Authorities have warned that the deluge will continue.

“The heavy rains are still on and we advise people to take precaution. Farms have been destroyed and roads made impassible. This will cause food prices to go up as we have already experienced in some parts of the country,” said Uganda’s minister for disaster preparedness, Musa Ecweru.

A severe drought across East Africa last year left Somalia on the brink of famine, while more than three million required food aid in Kenya and almost eight million needed aid in Ethiopia. Food prices and inflation soared in the region as a result."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2018/05/05/hundreds-dead-as-floods-wreak-havoc-in-east-africa/

For wetter or worse: Philippine bride defies storm, floods to walk down aisle|09/10/2018|"A beaming bride defiantly marching up a flooded church aisle in the Philippines has won hearts as the country suffers a fresh bout of monsoonal rains.

Jobel Delos Angeles, 24, married the father of her two children on Saturday as Tropical Storm Yagi and the southwest monsoon brought heavy flooding to the capital Manila and nearby areas, including their home province of Bulacan.

In a Facebook video shared over a thousand times, Delos Angeles is all smiles as she walks through brown floodwaters in a white gown and veil before her suited groom clad in flip-flops takes her to the altar.

“Even if it floods or it rains, nothing can stop me. You only get married once, will you postpone it? I was marrying the man I love,” Delos Angeles told AFP by phone.

“My gown got wet and heavy but I told myself it was as if I was walking on a red carpet.”

The Philippines endures an average of 20 typhoons and storms each year.

The latest storm brought misery to many, with 20,000 residents fleeing the riverside district of Marikina in the national capital region where floods swept away cars, authorities said.

But for Delos Angeles, the weekend was cause for celebration.

She said she and her partner of seven years did not expect bad weather but never considered calling off their wedding even after floodwaters entered the church in Hagonoy town.

It was a double ceremony, with their five-month-old daughter baptised in the same event, she added.

Guests were photographed barefoot, including children who were afraid to slip.

“We didn’t want a new schedule as we were already stressed out. Our hometown is really flood-prone,” Delos Angeles added.

“No car wanted to bring us to the church so I just rode a boat. We didn’t expect so many people would still turn up, even the entourage.”

The bride’s aunt, Teresa Bautista, posted the video of her niece which has drawn comments from social media users hailing the event as the “wedding of year”.

“I felt bad for them but at the same time I am happy they got it through,” Bautista told AFP.

Delos Angeles said she had no regrets.

“It is truly memorable. I am so happy. It shows the lesson that there are no what ifs.”"|https://nilepost.co.ug/2018/08/12/for-wetter-or-worse-philippine-bride-defies-storm-floods-to-walk-down-aisle/
Uganda sends food assistance to flood-affected families in Golwayn, Somalia’s Lower Shabelle region|01/06/2018|"The Ugandan government today donated foodstuff to flood-affected families in Golwayn, in Somalia’s Lower Shabelle region.

The lorry-loads of assorted food consisting of rice, wheat flour, sugar, cooking oil and milk, was delivered through the Ugandan AMISOM contingent.

Uganda’s Deputy Ambassador to Somalia, Maj. Gen. Nathan Mugisha flagged off the food convoy.

“Uganda is not only here to do the security part only. We feel sympathetic with the people and we join the wider international community in bringing rescue to especially the displaced communities of Golwayn who have been displaced by the enemy into IDPs (camps); but now have been displaced again by the flooding River Shabelle,” Maj. Gen. Mugisha said, while handing over the donation to Golwayn elders.

The food will benefit needy families who have borne the brunt of the heavy downpour.

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance, the flooding has affected more than 750,000 people with more than 229,000 displaced. Communities most affected by the flooding live along the Shabelle and Jubba rivers.

The flooding, caused by the unusually heavy Gu rains, has also led to fatalities and damage to infrastructure.

Ambassador Mugisha called for more support from other well wishers, to the flood-affected families.

Brig. Paul Lokech, the Uganda contingent commander noted that the flooding had also adversely impacted on agriculture and movement of persons.

He said some of the displaced families had sought shelter and safety near the AMISOM military defences.

“The areas where the people should be farming is all flooded. There is no productive activity taking place,” explained Brig. Lokech.

He added: “That therefore means the next season is going to be very difficult for our people. Because if our people cannot produce this year because of the flooding, then that means next year there is going to be problems regarding food. So, we anticipate this flooding is going to have a negative impact on the agricultural production in Lower Shabelle”.

Sultan Warsame Alio Ibrow, a elder and chief of Golwayn who received the food donation expressed gratitude to the Ugandan government and AMISOM for the assistance and called for more humanitarian interventions to assist affected families.

“There is no area that has not been affected by the floods in areas with close proximity to River Jubba and River Shabelle. Some people who have fled from villages in Lower Shabelle including Gaburow, Bulla Sheikh, Madulow up to Janaale areas, are now squatting in Golwayn, as internally displaced,” Sultan said.

The elder estimated that at least 750 displaced families from other regions, had moved to Golwayn in search of food and shelter."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2018/06/02/uganda-sends-food-assistance-to-flood-affected-families-in-golwayn-somalias-lower-shabelle-region/
Somali government, UN appeal for $80 million for flood victims following heaviest rainfall in decades|29/06/2020|"The humanitarian branches of the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and the United Nations today launched an appeal for $80 million to provide immediate help for people affected by recent flooding in the country’s centre and south – resulting from the heaviest rainfall experienced in Somalia in more than three decades.

The appeal falls within a broader appeal made at the start of 2018 for $1.5 billion for the humanitarian needs of more than five million people affected by drought and conflict across the country. Early this year, below-average rainfall had been anticipated.

“Unlike in 2017, when funding came in very early in the year to support the famine prevention, less than $370 million has been recorded to date in 2018,” the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Somalia, Peter de Clercq, said at the launch in Mogadishu of the so-called Somalia Flood Response Plan.

“This is a fraction of what we require to address the existing case load prior to the onset of the flooding,” he added.

The UN official was speaking at a high-level event, convened by the Somalia’s Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, in partnership with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

According to OCHA, the moderate to heavy rains across Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands have resulted in increased river flooding, particularly along the Juba and Shabelle rivers, and localized flash flooding.

The flooding has led to fatalities, massive displacement, and damage to infrastructure and cropland, compounding an already fragile humanitarian situation.

It adds that more than 750,000 people are estimated to have been affected by the flooding and more than 229,000 are displaced. With the existing $1.5 billion 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan for Somalia only 24 per cent funded, humanitarian partners are unable to support a robust flood response.

Those attending today’s event – the High-Level Roundtable on Flood Response – in the Somali capital included representatives from the FGS, Federal Member States, UN agencies, and other national and international humanitarian partner agencies.

In his remarks, Mr. De Clercq – who co-chaired the gathering with Somalia’s Deputy Prime Minister and Chairperson of the National Flood Response Committee, Mahdi Mohamed Guled – highlighted the longer-term risks facing populations affected by floods.

“As climate change risks invariably increase,” he said, “more resources are needed to address the root causes of fragility, chronic poverty and low human development that are affecting the bulk of the population.”

He underscored the need for longer-term investment to build resilience to climatic shocks and to break the cycle of recurrent crises, which are causing much suffering, while also undermining Somalia’s state-building process – comments echoed by the top FGS official present.

“Tackling climate change is working on resilience: long-term programmes, especially in river areas, and in shorter-term periods, trying to respond to the effects of climate change,” Deputy Prime Minister Guled told the round-table. “Nowadays people talk about climate change refugees and, truly, what we are experiencing is displaced people – displaced because of climate change.”

Both Mr. de Clercq and Mr. Guled appealed for increased funding from development partners to support the delivery of much-needed assistance to flood-affected communities.

Funds are needed to help mitigate the effects of flooding in affected regions, where response priorities include services in camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs), the provision of emergency services in schools, food assistance to displaced communities, and health and nutrition in flood-affected areas.

Other priority areas include the provision of transport to deliver humanitarian assistance and family protection, as well as the provision of shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene facilities.

The flooding comes against the backdrop of ongoing efforts to address the effects of previous consecutive drought seasons which left at least 5.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.

The first half of Somalia’s Gu rainy season, which started in March, has recorded an unprecedented amount of rainfall, comparable only to heavy rains last witnessed in Somalia in 1981.

According to the Flood Response Plan, more devastation is likely to take place, if the heavy rains continue. The plan notes that although the full impact of the flooding is yet to be established, the rains have impacted on communities that are already vulnerable, due to ongoing conflict and previous drought conditions.

The plan also notes that when the waters recede, the rainy season could offer an opportunity for agricultural and pastoral communities previously affected by drought in the regions, to reduce food insecurity."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2018/05/21/somali-government-un-appeal-for-80-million-for-flood-victims-following-heaviest-rainfall-in-decades/
Teso flood victims receive relief items worth Shs 387 million|15/06/2020|"AGGREY NYONDWA KIKOBERA

The April floods that hit Teso region in Eastern Uganda left the entire region devastated and in ruins; no food, shelter, property and other basic needs.

The heavy downpours that lasted for months washed away people’s homes, crops and left almost an entire region starving and displaced.

According to residents of Abarilela Sub County in Amuria district, lives were lost and communities have never been able to get up again.

They have been crying to relief agencies and government to run to their rescue following this disastrous blow.

On 17th August, Uganda Red Cross and OPM, with support from UNICEF and UNHCR distributed relief items worth Ushs 387 million to the affected households.

The week long distribution exercise is meant to bring relief to those who lost their homes and property as a result of the floods

“Today we are here to extend this sort of assistance to these affected communities. They have cried for a long time and the government appreciates the efforts made by our partners to respond. Our teams ensured to identify the most affected sub counties and households that were badly hit and we have decide to start with these ones,” said Musa Ecweru, the state minister Relief and Disaster Preparedness.

Uganda Red Cross volunteers on ground working with the district disaster management committees assessed the impact of the floods and identified the most hit areas and the affected households.

It’s from this assessment that the basis of the distribution was informed.

“We are honored to take on the mandate to spearhead this distribution. These people were badly hit and have been suffering for so long. We have to appreciate OPM for overseeing this, UNICEF for the Aqua tabs and covering the distribution costs, then UNHCR for the tarpaulins and blankets. Our volunteers have been in these communities doing impact assessment and verification. This is how we were able to identify the most affected households,” said Jimmy Asea, coordinator for this relief distribution exercise at Uganda Red Cross Society

Among the items distributed included 2,000 tarpaulins which could be used to put up temporary shelters, 10,000 blankets for adults and children, and Aqua tabs for water purification.

Teso region has in the past battled cholera outbreaks as a result of the floods which lead to improper disposal of human excretion and contamination of borehole water.

According to Ecweru, a recent survey indicates that 80% of the water got from the boreholes is contaminated and therefore needs to be purified to make it clean and safe for drinking.

During the distribution, Red Cross WASH officers held a sensitization session to demonstrate and teach the beneficiaries how to use and apply the water purification tablets effectively, and how to improve sanitation.

The sub county’s leadership couldn’t be any happier.

They expressed their gratitude to all the participating organizations and government for coming to their rescue.

“We really thank Red Cross and the other organizations for what you’ve done today and what I believe are going to do in other parts of the region. The people of Abarilela have been suffering for so long following the loss of all our crops as a result of the rains. We understand that resources are never enough but there are still more affected people and our prayer is that you keep it up and expand this generosity to other remote parts of the district,” said Michael Eluluma the Abarilela sub county chairperson.

The distribution targets over 10,000 people in the region and throughout the week will be carried out in Katakwi, Bukedea and Kumi districts.

Teso region received heavy downpours that started earlier in March. This prompted farmers to quickly plant their crops only to be washed away a month later by the disastrous floods.

The situation got out of hand when Lake Bisinia and other rivers burst their banks which led to the prolonged floods. About five people lost their lives and thousands were displayed."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2018/08/24/teso-flood-victims-receive-relief-items-worth-shs-387-million/
100 dead as Nigeria declares national disaster over flooding in four states|07/07/2020|"The Nigerian government on Monday declared a national disaster over flooding that has affected four states – Kogi, Niger, Anambra and Delta.

At least 100 people are reported to have died as a result of the floods.

The declaration was made by head of the National Emergency Management Agency,NEMA, on behalf of President Buhari, who had last week delegated that duty.

“On behalf of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed forces of the federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, I, Engineer Mustapha Maihaja, the Director-General of National Emergency Management Agency, hereby declare national disaster in the following states: Kogi state, Niger state, Anambra state and Delta state.

Cars plunge in floods as Moroto is cut off from the rest of country again|01/07/2020|"Two cars on Friday morning were submerged by floods at Latome bridge on the road to Moroto.

According to an eye witness Francis Okidi, the cars; A centenary bank pick up truck and a lorry truck were trying to make their way in the floods on the only available diversion route to Moroto when they were swallowed up by the water.

“I was in front of them, so I struggled to pass but they did not make it. People are stuck on either side of the bridge. Those in Moroto side cannot cross while those from the opposite side can’t cross either,” he said.

Okidi however said no one had died and the trucks have been pulled out of the floods.

Uganda National Roads Authority yesterday issued a statement regarding heavy flooding of Omanimani River in Moroto. In the statement, the Authority noted that public transport has been affected at Kangole Bridge and at the alternative routes of Lotome-Lorengdwat and Matany-Kangolechini.

“From Soroti to Moroto The only existing diversion, [Lorengedwat-Nadunget road] currently has fast rising waters and the drift at Lotome is also unsafe to public transport. In the interim, we call for patience from travellers as flood levels subside,” the statement reads in part.

“The flooded diversion routes have been cordoned off with warning tapes to prevent the public from approaching them. The OCs of Lotome, Kangole Police stations and Moroto OC Traffic are informed and have adequately deployed along the cut off routes to direct traffic,” statement continues.

UNRA advised motorists to access Moroto from Mbale using Muyembe-Nakapiripirit road.

In April, the Kangole bridge diversion connecting Teso region to Karamoja region in Napaka district was washed away.

East Africa Flood Deaths Surpass 400|14/05/2018|"Heavy rains have left hundreds of people dead and hundreds of thousands more displaced across various parts of East Africa. Kenya, Somalia and Rwanda are the worst hit. The flooding comes as the region tries to recover from a severe drought in 2017 that threatened millions of people.

Across Kenya, Rwanda and Somalia, the death toll from the flooding has surpassed 400, with many thousands more forced to flee their homes to escape rising waters.

Rwanda’s Ministry of Disaster Management puts its death toll at just over 200 in a period of four months.The number includes 18 killed this month as a result of landslides triggered by heavy rains.

In Somalia, the Juba and Shabelle rivers have burst their banks.

Justin Brady, head of the U.N. Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Somalia, said the situation has left those affected by the flooding vulnerable to malnutrition and disease.

“We have had a number of deaths reported at different junctures in the flooding.,” he said “I believe right now we are looking at about 220,000 people who are temporarily displaced due to the flood waters and until those recede, those people will remain displaced and in need of humanitarian assistance. We may see that number climb up in the short term with flooding spreading down stream as flood waters move towards the Indian Ocean.”

Earlier in the week, at least 15 people died in Somaliland when heavy rains caused by tropical cyclone Sagar swept through the Horn of Africa. The cyclone system has caused heavy rains in both the Puntland and Somaliland regions of Somalia, and then moved along the coast to Djibouti.

Brady said those areas were especially hard-hit by drought the last three years.

“So you already had a very low level of resilience of the population,” he said. “There are several districts that were most affected. The government is continuing to refine the number of people in need and initially it was around 670,000. That number has come down as I understand, but it’s a case of being able to get into areas.”

In Kenya, the Red Cross said at least 200 people have died as a result of the heavy rains. In the biggest catastrophe, a dam burst last week on a commercial farm in the Rift Valley, killing at least 48.

Emergency appeals have been launched by the affected governments and NGOs for humanitarian assistance."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2018/05/25/east-africa-flood-deaths-surpass-400/
Double curse: After drought, Kenya’s Dadaab refugee camps hit by floods|02/07/2020|"The children can’t believe their luck: storms and showers have turned their dirt football pitch into a lake. Youngsters scamper and splash through the murky water, chasing one another, leaping and laughing.

Any entertainment is welcome in Dadaab, one of the biggest refugee bases in the world. An estimated 235,000 people, most of them Somalis, live a bleak life largely defined by drought, dust and destitution.

But the children’s fun is fleeting. The seasonal rains also bring cholera and malaria, destroy rickety hand-made homes and paralyse the aid operation that is the refugees’ lifeline.

Some tracks and paths in the camps are thigh-deep in water. A woman gathers her soggy hijab about her as she wades through it. A man rolls up his trousers as high as he can but they still get wet. Progress is slow.

“We have nowhere to sleep… the water has covered everything,” said Hassan Yussuf, a 34-year-old father of five.

The earth floor of his home, built of thorny sticks and corrugated tin, is under 20 centimetres (almost eight inches) of water.

– Search for dry land –

The family has relocated to the foot of a nearby tree, their meagre belongings hung in its branches.

Inside their hut only one bed remains, above the waterline for now. On it and still dry lies Yussuf’s blind, 80-year-old mother.

“I hang out in one place or another, always looking for somewhere dry,” he said, hoping the night will not bring more floods.

“Dadaab is located on a plain where the rainwater does not drain easily, there are no drainage systems and no nearby river,” explained Caleb Odhiambo of charity Save the Children, which works in the camps. “It can be several weeks before the water returns to a normal level.”

In the meantime, pit latrines are overflowing, contaminating the water and threatening to spread disease.

Cholera is the greatest danger, especially for children who play in — and anyone who drinks — the contaminated waters.

Every year rainy-season cholera outbreaks infect many hundreds of the refugees who have fled cycles of civil war and famine in Somalia since 1991.

During the last heavy rains, in late 2015, more than a thousand people were infected and 14 of them died.

On top of that, the transformation of the camp from desert to swamp brings with it mosquitoes, and so malaria.

– Flood or drought –

“When the area is flooded, people are exposed to several diseases,” said 25-year-old Dadaab resident Mokhtar Dahari. The day before, he said, a child drowned in the rainwater nearby.

“Because of the floods, people cannot access the health centres,” Dahari said.

A driver working for a non-governmental organisation in Dadaab confirmed that some parts of the camps are “flooded and inaccessible. Humanitarian activities are slowed down.”

For now, Dahari has been spared: the floodwaters stopped a few meters (yards) from his hut. Clad in sopping jeans and clutching a shovel, he fills sandbags to barricade his home ahead of the next storm.

The rains, Dahari said, are enough to make him long for drought. “If the water rises again, the foundations of my house will be destroyed,” he said.

Odhiambo bitterly observed: “In Dadaab, you are doomed when it doesn’t rain, and doomed when it does.”"|https://nilepost.co.ug/2018/04/28/after-drought-kenyas-dadaab-refugee-camps-hit-by-floods/
Sand mining could trigger deadly floods in Lwera|17/02/2018|"The sand mining, which has triggered public uproar in the past, is done by a number of companies, among them, Ark Uganda Limited, a company owned by Pastor Samuel Kakande, Freedom Multi Company, Seroma Limited and Parkson Hongkong Investments.The companies have stationed dredgers in the middle of the wetland and scooped tonnes of sand more than 10 metres underneath the swamp, from an area covering more than 100 kilometres across the highway.

The activities have created dangerous open pits that are filled with water now on the verge of crossing through the road, the main gateway to Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Gerald Ssenyondo Kikyamu, the LCIII Chairperson of Lukaya Town Council said that although sand mining existed in Lwera for many years, the use of heavy machinery had turned it into a deadly activity that is leaving the terrain bare.

James Musisi, a resident of Kamuwunga village feared that many of them could be displaced by the sand mining activities."|https://nilepost.co.ug/2018/01/27/sand-mining-could-trigger-deadly-floods-in-lwera/
