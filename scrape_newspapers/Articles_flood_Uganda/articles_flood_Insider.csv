Gov’t Delivers Relief Food to Rubanda Flood Victims – the|29/09/2017|"The office of the Prime Minister has delivered 250 bags of maize flour in aid of flood victims in the sub-counties of Muko and Bufundi in Rubanda district. Each bag contains 100 kilogrammes of flour.

The relief follows a heavy downpour that paralyzed the areas on Tuesday leading to landslides that claimed 17 lives in Nfasha trading centre, Kachereere Parish, Muko Sub County and Rwaseyeza village in Mugyera Parish, Bufundi Sub County.

14 other people sustained injuries during the landslides while eight are still missing. The floods also damaged over 50 houses and ravaged crop gardens.

State Minister for Relief and Disaster Preparedness Musa Ecweru says that priority, in the distribution of relief food, was accorded to families that lost loved ones and those that sustained injuries in the tragedy. They received 300 kilograms of maize flour and 100 kilograms of maize flour respectively.

Ecweru says that the rest of the flour will be distributed equally among displaced people and families hosting them.

Rubanda District Chairperson Jogo Kenneth Biryabarema hailed the government for the timely intervention saying hundreds of the residents had been left with nothing to eat.

MTN Uganda Supports Kasese Floods Victims With Non-Food Start-up kits – the|11/05/2020|"MTN Uganda through its Corporate Social Responsibility arm, the MTN Foundation has donated Shs. Ugx 41,000,000 million towards the Kasese floods victims. This money will be used to buy non-food relief items to support the families that have been displaced.

The devastating floods ensued after River Nyamwamba burst its banks, following the heavy rains that hit the Rwenzori Mountain ranges.

Over 24,760 households with approximately 173,320 people were affected by the flash floods. Almost up to 150 houses were destroyed in Karusandara division while another 92 houses were completely washed away in Nyamwamba and kilembe areas. The displaced people have sought shelter from nearby churches and school buildings following a directive from Hon. Musa Ecweru, the state Minister for Relief and Disaster Preparedness during his visit to the area last week.

It is against this premise MTN Uganda, through it’s foundation that aims at improving the lives of the communities within which it operates by supplementing government efforts in priority areas including disaster responses has urgently come in to reach out to the Kasese floods victims with relief aid.

While handling over the dummy cheque to the Red Cross and Officials from the office of the Prime Minister, MTN Uganda’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Wim Vanhelleputte said remarked that facing such a disaster in these unprecedented times when the globe is grappling with the Covid19 pandemic and the country in a state of lock-down, spells double tragedy for the people of Kasese, thus prompting urgent relief from mtn and all other stake holders to save the lives of people.

This was during a dummy cheque handover at the Nyonyi Gardens MTN offices in Kampala this morning.

Wim further expressed MTN’s heartfelt sympathy to the people of Kasese.

“As MTN Uganda, we stand with the people of Kasese who have suffered great loss in the recent heavily destructive flash floods. We understand that this is such a trying time, especially since we are already battling the devastating effects of the Covid19 pandemic. We hope that this modest support we have rendered will offer them some comfort,”

While receiving the cheque, Robert Kwesiga, Uganda Red Cross Secretary General appreciated MTN for always coming through very fast to support whenever the Country has emergences.

“This is not the first time MTN Uganda has supported people affected by disasters. Last year they supported Bududa twice, supported Bundibugyo and today they are supporting Kasese. This consistent commitment is a true humanitarian spirit exhibited by MTN to support it’s community. Amidst this period when all partners including MTN have heavily invested in the COVID-19 fight, MTN has still managed to support Kasese. We want to thank you.” Kwesiga said.

The money shall be used to procure 100 standard household non-food-item kits to reach out to 100 most vulnerable families comprising of children, youths, women and the elderly. Each of the kits contains 2 cooking pots, 6 cups, 6 plates, 1 knife, 1 ladle, 2 jerry cans, 3 blankets, 3 mosquito nets, 3 bars of soap and 1 tarpaulin for shelter.

In 2013, the MTN foundation spent about 250m to support the kilembe mines hospital which had been affected by similar floods through refurbishment of the children and maternal ward and provided items to support the hospital inclusive of 100 hospital beds, mattresses, mosquito nets as well a generator.

On behalf of the Government of Uganda, the Ag Commissioner for Disaster Preparedness Ms. Rose Nakabugo extended warm heartfelt appreciation to MTN Foundation for the support to the people of Kasese. “This is very timely. We thank MTN and commit that the donated items will right away be delivered to Kasese to help people cope through this situation. Thank you for complementing our efforts.”"|https://theinsider.ug/index.php/2020/05/11/mtn-uganda-supports-kasese-floods-victims-with-non-food-start-up-kits/
Rwenzori MPs Distraught by Delayed Govt Response to Kasese Floods – the|22/05/2020|"MP Godfrey Katusabe representing Bukonjo County West in Kasese district

Indeed procurement of 10 Intensive Care Beds and 10 Ventilators per Regional Refferral Hospitals is underway. 55 new ambulances also to be supplied in June this year

While on the floor of Parliament of Uganda this afternoon, Hon. Kyagulanyi Robert aka Bobi Wine has challenged the proposal by Government to Limit the production of face masks to only #Nytil .

He says that there are many other Ugandans in the informal sector who are working extremely hard to produce face masks to earn a living but more importantly to contribute in the fight against.

Members of Parliament from the Rwenzori sub-region are disturbed by government’s delay in responding to the floods and mudslides that hit Kasese district a fortnight ago, displacing many and claiming lives.

At the beginning of May, three rivers in Kasese district burst their banks leading to the floods that have devastated residents.

Legislators during the Thursday, 21 May 2020 plenary sitting expressed anguish when the Prime Minister, Dr Ruhakana Rugunda, announced that government had not yet drawn a comprehensive plan to rescue victims of the floods.

“It cannot be business as usual, in Bukonjo West, five people were covered by floods, 14 people were swept away and we do not know what the weather has again for our people. We want a comprehensive action plan from the government,” said Atkins Katusabe (FDC, Bukonjo County West).

Hon. William Nzoghu (FDC, Busongora County North) told Parliament, chaired by Speaker Rebecca Kadaga that the situation is in his constituency was “bothersome” as many people have not only been displaced from their homes but are unable to access basic services.

“There are more than 10 camps hosting displaced people, several areas have been cut off and they cannot access a health facility and even food. So, why is this situation being treated as a normal occurrence?” Nzoghu asked.

Parliament also learnt that 50 households living on the border with DR Congo are at loggerheads with their Congolese neighbours when River Lamya changed its course, leaving them on the side of DR Congo.

“The Congolese believe that the river is the boundary separating them from Uganda but the river changed it course. Now they cannot allow Ugandan citizens to access their gardens and so they are all staying in a primary school,” said the Bwamba County MP, Hon. Richard Gafabusa.

Dr Rugunda assured MPs that despite the absence of a statement on the response plan, government was on course and abreast with happenings in Kasese and Bundibugo districts.

“Yesterday, the President and some ministers visited Kasese and they know what is happening. In the immediate, relief in terms of food was made available,” said Rugunda before committing to make a comprehensive statement to the House on the situation in Kasese when it next resumes on Tuesday, 26 May 2020."|https://theinsider.ug/index.php/2020/05/22/rwenzori-mps-distraught-by-delayed-govt-response-to-kasese-floods/
Gov’t Pledges to Release Shs 20 billion for Emergency Response to Floods – the|27/11/2019|"The Ministry of Finance is to release Shs20 billion for emergency response to areas which have been recently hit by flooding.



The Minister of State for Finance (Planning), Hon David Bahati who was responding to a Shs43 billion request from the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness, said that all that money cannot be released immediately.



“Not all the money is needed now. We shall avail the shs20 million in the next two days,” Bahati said.



Bahati’s commitment follows a report by the Minister of State for Disaster Preparedness, Hon Musa Ecweru during plenary sitting on 26 November 2019.



Ecweru said there is need for an urgent response to 38,000km of district roads, 98,000km of urban roads and 79,000km of village access roads which have been destroyed by floods. He added that 20 bridges require overhaul.



“The above normal rain has caused water logging in many villages causing huge post-harvest destruction. Affected population of over eight million requires immediate shelter and relief food. Twenty districts are most prone to waterborne diseases,” said Ecweru.



He added that the impact of flooding is highest in the regions of Bugisu, Teso, Bukedi, Kigezi and Rwenzori as well as the districts of Ntoroko, Bundibugyo and Kasese.



“Eighty five per cent of the population in these regions and districts are facing severe losses of livelihoods in addition to destruction of commonly used infrastructure. The Bugisu region has experienced landslides in addition to flooding,” he said.



The Minister of State for Health, Hon Sarah Opendi advised the Minsiterfor Disaster to identify priority areas so that the funds are properly utilised.



“The ministry should explain to the House the identified priority areas because it looks like the bulk of the money will go to roads,” she said.



The Speaker, Rebecca Kadaga advised the ministry to involve the district disaster committees while identifying priority areas.



“The minister should prepare a schedule of the priority areas and report to the House tomorrow,” said Kadaga.



Legislators raised concern over the distribution of the funds saying that the ministry should ensure that all affected regions are covered.



Hon. Barnabas Tinkasimire (Ind. Buyaga West County) pointed out that there should be no repeat of reports where the Minister for Disaster was accused of misusing funds.



Hon. Hellen Asamo (NRM, PWDs Eastern) called for affirmative action for Persons With Disabilities (PWDs) while distributing relief.



“PWDs miss out because distribution of relief items is characterised by struggles which we cannot engage in,” she said.



In October this year, the Meteorogical Department forecast that the country would experience above-normal rains between the months of September and December."|https://theinsider.ug/index.php/2019/11/27/govt-pledges-to-release-shs-20-billion-for-emergency-response-to-floods/
Teso People Living Like Birds over Floods-MPs – the|21/06/2018|"A section of people in Teso are currently living like birds after floods ravaged the sub region leaving many homeless and displaced, according to MPs.

While presenting their plight before the media at Parliament on Thursday, Teso MPs led by Teso Parliamentary Group chairperson Patrick Okabe (Serere County) expressed dissatisfaction following government’s slow response to provide necessary support to the victims.

“People in Teso have no place to dry their foods. Most roads have been totally cut off and it is even worse in Katakwi district. We are asking for immediate interventions so that government can provide tents for people to dry their foods. Our people also need immediate supply of foods and for those whose homes have collapsed used be given iron sheets,” Okabe said.

David Abala, Ngora County MP confirmed that currently 5 people have died due to floods that started in April this year.

“There is nothing coming from the Office of the Prime Minister despite several letters that we have written to the Prime Minister. Government is operating in a lukewarm manner. People are sleeping like birds as if there is no ministry in charge of disaster,” Abala said.

Kumi Municipality MP Silas Aogon appealed to government to act as ‘flying squad’ and rescue the people of Teso who have time and again been entangled in a vicious cycle of continued disaster.

Toroma County MP Andrew Koluo whose constituency is the most ravaged by floods said that the waters have devastated most roads among them include; Amusia, Gweri, Palam, Kapujan, Ongongoja, Magoro, Angodingod and others. Koluo was last week in Toroma where he witnessed how floods have cut off the roads in the area.

“My appeal to government is provide tents to the people to harvest their crops and in terms of transport, I appeal to government to provide boats so that people are able to connect from one place to another,” Koluo said.

The MPs expressed dissatisfaction with state minister for Disaster Preparedness, Musa Ecweru who also hails from Teso, for ignoring the plight of his people."|https://theinsider.ug/index.php/2018/06/21/teso-people-living-like-birds-over-floods-mps/
JUBILATION: Zimbabweans flood Harare to celebrate expected Mugabe downfall – the|18/11/2017|"Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans flooded the streets of Harare on Saturday, singing, dancing and hugging soldiers in an extraordinary outpouring of elation at the expected fall of President Robert Mugabe, their leader of the last 37 years.

Mugabe, the only ruler Zimbabwe has known since independence from Britain in 1980, has been holed up in his lavish ‘Blue Roof’ compound, from where he has watched support from his Zanu-PF party, the security services and the people evaporate in the wake of a military seizure of power on Wednesday.

On the streets of the capital, Zimbabweans let their emotions run free as they spoke of political and economic change after two decades of repression and deepening hardship.

“These are tears of joy,” Frank Mutsindikwa, 34, told Reuters, holding aloft the Zimbabwean flag. “I’ve been waiting all my life for this day. Free at last. We are free at last.”

Some held aloft placards reading “No to Mugabe dynasty” and pumping their fists in the air in a sign of freedom. Others embraced the soldiers who seized power, shouting “Thank you! Thank you!” in scenes unthinkable even a week ago.

“These are our leaders now,” said Remember Moffat, 22, waving a picture of army commander Constantino Chiwenga and Emmerson Mnangagwa, the former vice president whose sacking this month precipitated the military intervention.

“My dream is to see a new Zimbabwe. I’ve only known this tyrant called Mugabe my whole life.”

The ruling ZANU-PF called on Friday for Mugabe to resign, the main state newspaper The Herald reported, in a clear sign that the 93-year-old leader’s authority has gone.

Mugabe is admired by some in Africa as an elder statesman and anti-colonial hero. But many more at home and abroad revile him as a dictator happy to resort to violence to retain power and to run a once-promising economy into the ground.

The Herald, a normally loyal Mugabe mouthpiece, said ZANU-PF branches in all 10 provinces were also calling for Mugabe’s wife Grace, whose ambitions to succeed her husband have outraged the military and much of the country, to resign from the party.

A senior member of ZANU-PF told Reuters the party wanted Mugabe out, and would not tolerate foot-dragging.

“If he becomes stubborn, we will arrange for him to be fired on Sunday,” the source said. “When that is done, it’s impeachment on Tuesday.”

Pointedly, the military threw its weight behind Saturday’s “solidarity march”, part of an apparent attempt to give its use of force a veneer of massive popular support, to avoid the diplomatic backlash that normally follows coups.

Buyers flood Metroplex Shopping mall as URA auctions Nakumatt goods – the|06/09/2017|"The challenges facing the giant retail Kenya-owned Nakumatt supermarket in Uganda prove to be unending following the closure of Nakumatt branch at Metroplex mall which brings forth to an additional number of branches closed in the country.

The branch at Metroplex mall whose goods are being auctioned today was closed two weeks ago and right now, URA is auctioning out the goods to very many people who have turned up to buy them at cheaper prices.

It is also noticed that when this supermarket was closed, it had very many perishable goods and right now most of the customers are turning away from buying the auctioned goods because of the pungent smell from the perishable goods that were locked up inside the supermarket.

Two weeks back, URA ordered Nakumatt branches to be closed due to failure to pay up taxes and since then, they have not been in operation.

Nakumatt has since the year began closed some stores in Uganda. The first branch to be closed was the one in Mbarara but unfortunately, its closure brought more trouble as a government official who was housing it, sued the company for rent arrears.

It was then followed by the branches at Acacia mall, Village mall and Victoria mall."|https://theinsider.ug/index.php/2017/09/06/buyers-flood-metroplex-shopping-mall-as-ura-auctions-nakumatt-goods/
