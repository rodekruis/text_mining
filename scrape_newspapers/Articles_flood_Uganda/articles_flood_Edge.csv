Camps emerge as Kasese floods cast Ugandans in Congo|23/05/2020|"Members of Parliament from the Rwenzori sub-region are disturbed by government’s delay in responding to the floods and mudslides that hit Kasese district a fortnight ago, displacing many and claiming lives.

At the beginning of May, three rivers in Kasese district burst their banks leading to the floods that have devastated residents.

Legislators during the Thursday, 21 May 2020 plenary sitting expressed anguish when the Prime Minister, Dr Ruhakana Rugunda, announced that government had not yet drawn a comprehensive plan to rescue victims of the floods.

“It cannot be business as usual, in Bukonjo West, five people were covered by floods, 14 people were swept away and we do not know what the weather has again for our people. We want a comprehensive action plan from the government,” said Atkins Katusabe (FDC, Bukonjo County West).

Hon. William Nzoghu (FDC, Busongora County North) told Parliament, chaired by Speaker Rebecca Kadaga that the situation is in his constituency was “bothersome” as many people have not only been displaced from their homes but are unable to access basic services.

“There are more than 10 camps hosting displaced people, several areas have been cut off and they cannot access a health facility and even food. So, why is this situation being treated as a normal occurrence?” Nzoghu asked.

Parliament also learnt that 50 households living on the border with DR Congo are at loggerheads with their Congolese neighbours when River Lamya changed its course, leaving them on the side of DR Congo.

“The Congolese believe that the river is the boundary separating them from Uganda but the river changed it course. Now they cannot allow Ugandan citizens to access their gardens and so they are all staying in a primary school,” said the Bwamba County MP, Hon. Richard Gafabusa.

Dr Rugunda assured MPs that despite the absence of a statement on the response plan, government was on course and abreast with happenings in Kasese and Bundibugo districts.

“Yesterday, the President and some ministers visited Kasese and they know what is happening. In the immediate, relief in terms of food was made available,” said Rugunda before committing to make a comprehensive statement to the House on the situation in Kasese when it next resumes on Tuesday, 26 May 2020."|http://edge.ug/2020/05/23/camps-emerge-as-kasese-floods-cast-ugandans-in-congo/

This followed a heavy down pour between 6th and 7th December which devastated the entire district.

A total of 1,152 households composed of 6,768 individuals were affected, 18 bodies retrieved, and left many homeless.

Over 800 households became displaced and occupied churches and nearby school buildings, while others coped through their extended family members in safer communities.

The Government gazetted Semuliki Secondary School and Bubkwanga Camp to accommodate those displaced/homeless and Uganda Red Cross offered humanitarian life line services for a period of two months.

Today, a lot has changed. When the rains normalized, some people developed coping mechanisms and have since moved to live with relatives, some re-built their homes, while others are still struggling.

Uganda Red Cross through its fundraising efforts engaged corporate entities to support the local appeal for disaster affected areas country wide.

“This is how Coca-Cola came on board. We are happy to extend a note of appreciation for the support offered to the people of Bundibugyo through The Coca-Cola Company. Thank you for responding to our call when we approached you.

Get out of wetlands, Museveni mourns flood victims|11/12/2019|"President Museveni has expressed condolences to the families of the nine Ugandans that died in the Elgon area and the 17 Ugandans that died in the Rwenzori area.

He said these losses, on account of floods and landslides, are, mainly, due to the mistake of insisting on settling (living) in areas that logic and God did not intend for human habitation.

These are the wetlands (ebisaaru, entobazi, emigga, mbalama, emyegyego ennyanja, swamps, wetlands, river-banks, and lakeshores) and steep mountains of 31-32% gradient or more than that.

“All people in such areas should accept resettlement as we have done with the previous Bududa victims that are now settled in Bulambuli,” Museveni noted.

Victoria University

He said those cultivating in the wetlands should accept government plan of changing to fish-farming as done in Limoto wetland, Pallisa District.

“You can have fish ponds on the edges (emiiga) of the swamps but not in the centre of the swamp.”

He said in order to expedite the evacuation of threatened People, government may have to look at only cash compensation instead of the protracted process of resettlement which involves the allocation of planned farms, permanent houses, etc as seen in Bulambuli.

With cash, People can, then, go and fend for themselves. The swamps and steep mountains are not for crops and human settlements (amaka), he noted.

He said the swamps are for water, ebigugu (cyperus latifolia) and papyrus (cyperus papyrus) and that undisturbed swamp water is for irrigation and the swamp grasses are for mulching (okwarira) crops.

The swamp grass also helps in the manufacture of rain through transpiration (sucking water from the wetland and putting it in the atmosphere to make rain).

“You normally see mist (oruho) along these swamps early in the morning. That is part of that transpiration that, eventually, helps with rain formation.”

According to the president, the swamp grass also filters the water of soil and impurities and, therefore, protects the Lakes from silting filling with soil.

Forests and vegetation along steep mountains use their roots to hold the soil and also act as cushion for raindrops (amakaanda) hitting the soil so that rain and the run-off water (omutuunga, omukoka, alele) does not sweep the soil, causing soil erosion and, eventually, landslides.

The tree-leaves and canopy also break the force of the raindrops.

The tree-roots and the dropping leaves, also form a soft bed on the forest floor and slows down the speed of mutuunga (run-off water) and forces the water to sink in the soil, thereby replenishing the water-table underground.

Instead of water running on the surface and causing destruction, it sinks in the soil.

“I will intensify the campaign for the Environment Resettlement fund so that those who were misled by the Government to go to the wetlands in the 1960s are compensated to get out. The recent encroachers should simply get out. Condolences, again.”"|http://edge.ug/2019/12/11/get-out-of-wetlands-museveni-mourns-flood-victims/

Somali president wades muddy water to access flood-hit town|03/11/2019|"Somalia President Mohamed Abdulahi Farmajo on Saturday waded through knee-deep muddy waters to access streets of Beledweyne town which was recently nearly washed away by floods.

He reportedly ordered parliament to donate their salaries to relieve about 100,000 families affected by this disaster.

Beledweyne is a city in central Somalia. Located in the Beledweyne District, it is the capital of the Hiiraan province.

The town is situated in the Shebelle Valley near the Ethiopia border, some 210 miles north of Mogadishu.

President Farmajo shocked onlookers when he stepped in and paddled across flooded streets to coordinate rescue efforts in Beledweyne caused by floods.

He thanked well-wishers for standing with Somalia, including, and mostly selfless citizens, for expressing a true sense of brotherhood and patriotism to be in solidarity with fellow citizens in Beledweyne.

President Farmajo, Speakers of the Lower House and the Upper House of the parliament and the Prime Minister had earlier announced to donate their salaries of October to the flood victims in the country.

The money will be handed over to the Emergency Commission.

The floods

More than 200,000 people, half of them children, have fled their homes following massive floods that have left most of a town in central Somalia under water, Save the Children said on Thursday.

People have been evacuated using tractors and boats from neighborhoods that have been submerged in water in Beledweyne town after days of rainfall and flooding, the charity said.

Thousands of residents in makeshift camps are in desperate need of food and water, the organization said.

Save the Children said its staff are working tirelessly screening children, but resources are inadequate to address the humanitarian scale of the problem.

“Somalia is on the front line of the climate crisis, and resources are being stretched to their limits,” Mohamud Mohamed Hassan, Save the Children Somalia Country Director said.

“The current needs are huge and we’re in danger of being overwhelmed if donors don’t step up urgently. Right now, our main concern is the potential health crisis, including cholera and malaria outbreaks, which are devastating diseases for children,” he added.

More than 85 percent of Beledweyne, home to an estimated 400,000 residents, has been inundated by floods, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Monday following an assessment of the area by the UNHCR-Protection Return Monitoring Network (PRMN).

OCHA said three people, including two children were reported to have drowned after a river in the town burst its banks on Saturday due to the rains.

A boat carrying 20 people also capsized on the river, and many passengers are feared missing, the UN agency said in a report.

Floods from the river had destroyed farmlands, roads, and other infrastructure in surrounding areas, according to the UN agency.

MPs fault KCCA for city floods|19/06/2019|"Members of Parliament have decried what they regard as laxity in Kampala Capital City Authority’s (KCCA) approach towards managing the torrential floods in Kampala.

This was in response to a statement presented to Parliament on Tuesday, 18 June 2019 by the State Minister for Kampala City, Benny Namugwanya, on KCCA’s plans for controlling floods.

The MPs blamed the problem of flooding on the incompetence of KCCA, citing their failure to implement development projects in the city and corruption.

Hon. Richard Gafabusa Muhumuza (NRM, Bwamba County) said people have been given permission to build in wetlands and thus obstructing water catchment areas.

Victoria University

“The ecological purpose of swamps and wetlands has been undermined and because of corrupt officials, people have plans that have been approved by KCCA,” he said.

Hon. Fred Mwesigye (NRM, Nyabushozi County) said that citizens are to blame to a certain extent because of their actions in waste disposal.

“There is gross indiscipline with people violating rules and dumping carelessly; other people have built in wetlands; there is a lot of pollution of Lake Victoria; and the city needs to be decongested by building satellite cities,” Mwesigye added.

He noted that all these issues need to be addressed by the government through the responsible government agencies.

Hon. Gordon Arinda Kakuma (NRM, Bushenyi-Ishaka Municipality) further criticised the Minister for lamenting over floods without giving any real solutions.

“We need to see action from KCCA instead of the Ministers of Kampala lamenting about the causes of flooding. There are laws to stop people from building in wetlands, poor disposal of waste and KCCA has been provided funds to improve the drainage of the city,” he added.

Hon. Betty Nambooze (DP, Mukono Municipality) and also Shadow Minister for Kampala Capital City Authority added that Kampala has become a battle ground of antagonistic politics at the expense of service delivery.

“Kampala leadership has failed to internalise the law constituting them. We gave them a Kampala Metropolitan Physical Planning Unit for them to effectively plan and organise this city,” she said.

Nambooze added that the Kampala Metropolitan Police should be instructed not to be selective in clamping down on people breaking the laws so that if they have to evacuate people from wetlands, no one is left behind.

She said that KCCA was given a grant to rectify the issue of drainage but they have failed.

“KCCA got money in form of a US$200 million grant to implement the Kampala Drainage Master Plan. However, it is going to expire in December before it is implemented,” she noted, adding that all this would go a long way to solve the problems of flooding.

Hon. Benny Namugwanya responded saying her statement was meant to inform Parliament about some of the challenges faced in trying to control floods in the country.

Namugwanya said that despite receiving funds from development partners to overhaul the drainage of Kampala, the government had failed to meet its part of the funding obligations."|http://edge.ug/2019/06/19/mps-fault-kcca-for-city-floods/

“I have already contacted the government to provide relief to the survivors especially those whose houses, property and gardens were destroyed,” she said.

According to Police, 13 people died in Kidera sub county in Buyende district, while another four perished in Kamuli district, including three in Balawoli and one in Namasagali. The Speaker represents Kamuli district in Parliament.

Kadaga urged local leaders to be on the lookout to avoid further destruction of the environment.

“The hailstorms have become fierce and resulted in fatalities because of rampant deforestation. Hundreds of acres of land have been cleared off forest cover,” she said adding “I therefore urge leaders at the lower level to check wanton abuse of the eco-system.”

She further urged leaders to encourage the population to stop deforestation and replace the trees by planting fruit trees such as mangoes, oranges and paw paws.

“Let us take advantage of the rainy season to start the re-afforestation programme; this will increase on the forest cover and will provide quick financial income to our communities,” she said."|http://edge.ug/2019/04/25/kadaga-mourns-kamuli-buyende-flood-deaths/

“I think we need a very big campaign to inform our people to go to the right places. In the market places, you find drugs displayed in the sun, people busy buying them; you don’t know whether they are expired, you don’t know whether they have been contaminated,” she said.

Kadaga was speaking at the celebration of Joint Medical Stores’ 40 years of service, in Jinja, on Thursday, 21 February 2019.

The Vicar General, Rev. Fr. Paul Musana, who represented the Archbishop of Kampala Archdiocese, noted that the sale of fake drugs puts pressure on suppliers of quality medicines.

“The biggest challenges we have are fake drugs and fake doctors; it is like a way of life which everyone has taken on because people like cheap things,” said Musana adding that “we call upon your support such that Parliament helps us ensure quality.”

Kadaga was happy to note that JMS was manufacturing a supplement called ‘Replenish’ from the local herb, Moringa, for treating children with the nodding disease syndrome and other chronic illness.

“You are doing import substitution because we do not have to import these drugs, and you are creating employment for those working in the industry, the Moringa growers and those who are going to market the products,” she said.

Kadaga was equally pleased that an earlier government programme encouraging Ugandans to grow Moringa will finally realize the desired results.

Upon a request from JMS, Kadaga pledged to work through the Parliamentary Budget Committee and advocate for increased funding for mission health facilities, saying that the funding has stagnated at Shs16 billion."|http://edge.ug/2019/02/22/fake-drugs-flooding-market-warns-kadaga/
Floods kill 280 people in East Africa|06/12/2019|"By XINHUA

At least 280 people have been killed and more than 2.8 million others affected by unusually heavy rainfall and flooding in eastern Africa, the United Nations (UN) humanitarian agency said on Thursday.

The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said homes, infrastructure and livelihoods have been destroyed and damaged in the hardest-hit areas, and the risk of communicable diseases including cholera is rising.

“Primarily driven by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the heavy rains are likely to persist into December and to intensify in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda,” OCHA said in its latest regional Flash Floods Update.

The UN agency said the annual short rains which ordinarily last from October to December have been exceptionally heavy in Kenya and affected more than 160,000 people in 31 of the country’s 47 counties.

Victoria University

“At least 132 people have reportedly died, including 72 who were killed by a landslide which buried their homes in West Pokot County,” said OCHA.

The storms have caused destruction and damage of key infrastructure in Kenya, including houses, health facilities and schools, displacing an unconfirmed number of people and disrupting basic services. Roads and bridges were damaged, hampering effective humanitarian response efforts in affected areas.

In Djibouti, the report says the equivalent of two years’ rainfall fell in one day, causing flash floods that have affected up to 250,000 people, including nine people killed.

“In many areas, the floods are coming on the back of consecutive droughts, while in others people impacted by the floods are also suffering from conflict and violence,” said OCHA.

“As families struggle to cope with these compounding and complex shocks, there is a high risk of their adopting negative coping mechanisms, including school drop-out and early marriage,” it warned.

According to OCHA, flooding in Somalia has affected 547,000 people, including an estimated 370,000 who have been displaced and 17 killed. In South Sudan, where 908,000 people have been affected since June, the flooding has submerged entire communities, destroyed or rendered inaccessible basic services and markets, and caused crop losses which will result in an early start of the lean season in January.

The UN agency said more than 420,000 people were affected by floods from August to October in Sudan, during which 78 people died and 49,500 homes were destroyed.

OCHA said about 570,000 people have been affected in Ethiopia, including more than 200,000 displaced, and rains have negatively affected the harvest season.

In Burundi, it said, 3,100 people were affected by torrential rains in Munyinga province, while in Uganda, flooding and landslides have impacted at least 12 districts, including Bundibugyo district, where more than 4,000 people were affected.

In Tanzania, said the UN agency, the death toll is over 50, including 10 people who were drowned by a flood-swollen river."|http://edge.ug/2019/12/06/floods-kill-280-people-in-east-africa/

Mafabi was Thursday appearing on NBS TV “morning breeze” programme to assess government readiness to tackle disaster alongside Hon. Musa Ecweru, State for Relief and Disaster Preparedness and Refugees.

According to Mafabi, contingency fund takes 3% of the budget and no one should claim that there is no money.

“I want to tell Pamela Ankunda [Uganda Communications Commission public relations officer] that a bad economy causes insecurity. A poor person is the most dangerous one.”

He added: “If this government was serious, the Minister of Disaster Preparedness would be camping in the mountains during rainy season.”

According to Mafabi, the problem in Uganda is speaking the truth because “85% of people in civil service come from one region”.

Mafabi urged government to investigate where the contingency fund went. “The Auditor General must tell us where this money is.”

He said the challenge in Mt. Elgon region is accessibility.

“We are using rudimentary tools because we can’t take equipment there. The terrain in Mount Elgon affects the search and rescue operations unlike other affected places like Elegu.”
