Bobi Wine Donates Shs13.5 Million To Kasese Flood Victims|20/05/2020|"Bobi Wine through his people power movement handed over a contribution of 13,500,000/= (Thirteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand Shillings) to Hon. Winnie Kiiza to assist sisters and brothers who are affected by flooding in Kasese district.

This money was contributed by ourselves as well as comrades in Uganda and abroad. I am very grateful to all of you who have responded to our call and made contributions to this noble cause. To you comrades in Kasese District, we stand with you and pray for you,’said Bobi Wine.

I have this afternoon received UGX 13.5 Million from @HEBobiwine as a donation from the People Power Movement in & outside Uganda. The donation is directed towards our call for contribution & restoration of hope for the victims of the #KaseseFloods. pic.twitter.com/ZOiD9IiyHF — Winnie Kiiza (@winniekiiza1) May 20, 2020

Kasese District was affected so bad by the recent floods that left thousands of people homeless, it destroyed property and others lost their lives.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank our people power friends for such a huge contribution towards this noble cause,’said Hon Winnie Kiiza.

The Kyadondo East MP has called upon the government to make an accountability for all the money and relief items which has been donated to the Covid-19 national taskforce.

During a press conference at People Power head office in Kamwokya yesterday, the ‘Kyarenga’ Hit maker mentioned that Covid-19 taskforce continues to demand from the public without publicly showing an accountability of how the contributions have been utilized.

As gov't demands 10k from struggling Ugandans ostensibly to fight #COVID, they're dishing out 40m to MPs who voted to amend age limit! As they blocked Ugandans from returning home, those close to power continued to come in. It becomes clearer why our struggle is MORAL & URGENT — BOBI WINE (@HEBobiwine) May 17, 2020

They have surprisingly asked for shs10,000 from Ugandans who earn a salary, but they have not taken the responsibility to inform us how the items and money they have all along been receiving since the lockdown began, has been distributed. This report is actually needed because Ugandans who are currently under home confinement are not working and yet the task force wants to squeeze money from them,’said Bobi.

Over One Million South Sudanese Refugees Will Flood East Africa|17/07/2016|"Over One Million South Sudanese Refugees Will Flood East Africa, According To U.N

JUBA, South Sudan — The number of South Sudanese refugees in East Africa could pass 1 million this year,[9] the United Nations refugee agency said Friday,[3] calling on armed groups to allow safe passage for people fleeing the latest fighting.

There is concern about fresh outflows of refugees after military clashes in recent days in the capital,[2] Juba, said Ann Encontre, a UN refugee coordinator in South Sudan. [1]She appealed for $701 million in relief aid.

“They are supposed to be the generation of tomorrow, the generation that will lead and rebuild their country,[8] but right now, they are suffering enormously,” she said.

Even before the violence of the past week, hundreds of thousands of refugees had been sheltering in Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, and elsewhere since civil war began in late 2013.

But there are new reports that South Sudan authorities are blocking some citizens,[12] including those with US or Canadian dual nationality, from leaving the country.

“We condemn all actions by the government to prevent civilians from boarding flights out of Juba or otherwise departing South Sudan,” State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told reporters in Washington.[6]

Opposing army factions clashed in Juba in the past week,[2] with forces backing President Salva Kiir bombing the home of former rebel leader Riek Machar, now the country’s first vice president.

Hundreds have been killed.[3] Red Cross workers Friday loaded pallets of bodies onto a truck at Juba Teaching Hospital for burial at a military site.

The fighting has threatened a peace deal reached in August to end the civil war between supporters of Kiir and Machar that left tens of thousands dead.[9]

Both Kiir and Machar on Monday called for a cease-fire, which has appeared to hold.[7]
