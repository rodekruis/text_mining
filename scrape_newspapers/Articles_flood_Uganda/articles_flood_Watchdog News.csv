Sara, the girl who was born in a mango tree above the floods making remarkable progress|24/06/2019|"Cyclone Idai struck Mozambique and Zimbabwe last month, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. But amid the horror are also stories of strength, resilience and survival. Like this one, about a pregnant woman who saved her son from the floods, and then, while clinging on for dear life in the branches of a mango tree, gave birth to her new daughter.

The mother’s name is Amélia, and she lives in a village near the small administrative outpost of Dombe, in Mozambique’s Manica province.

In her own words, according to the United Nations children’s agency, Unicef: “I was with my little 2-year-old son, when suddenly, without warning, the water started to get inside my house, I had no option but to jump on top of a nearby mango tree.

Then the pain started, and I had no one around to help me. In a few hours I gave birth to my baby girl Sara, on top of that mango tree. I was completely alone with Sara and my son. We stayed on top of that tree for two more days after her birth.

Later, the neighbours helped me to get down and we came to this place like everybody else,” she said, speaking from a temporary accommodation centre in Dombe.

The family is now receiving medical attention and support in a temporary accommodation centre in Dombe. “Baby Sara…now seems to be doing fine despite of her amazing arrival into this world. She is being breastfed constantly by her mother Amélia, who is receiving the solidarity and support from the other affected mothers in the accommodation centre,” said Unicef.

Sara is not the first Mozambican baby to be born in a tree during a flood. During the 2000 floods, baby Rosita made international headlines after being delivered in a tree in Chokwe village.

A decade later, the Mail & Guardian’s Beauregard Tromp caught up with her mother, Sofia Chubango, who recalled her harrowing experience. “It was very, very painful. I was crying, screaming. Sometimes I thought the baby was coming, but other times I thought it was because of hunger…We got scared, we feared we were going to be blown out of the tree.” Chubango knows, however that she — and Rosita — were among the lucky ones. “A lot of people lost everything in the floods, but I gained something,” she said.

UPDF rescues people affected by floods in Kasese, Bundibugyo|07/05/2020|"The Uganda People’ Defence Forces has established structures to respond to the flood situation in Bundibugyo and Kasese Districts. This includes airlift support services on call, search and rescue, and a unit for relocation established on ground to respond to the emergency.

UPDF contingent from the 222 Mountain Infantry Brigade under the command of Lt Col Denis Wanyama is deployed to help in the relocation and assisting of the affected communities.

The Uganda Peoples’ Defence Air Forces is also on standby to render airlift services. On May 07, 2020, the Uganda Peoples’ Defence Air Forces airlifted the Minister of State for Disaster Preparedness, Musa Ecweru from Kololo Airstrip to Kasese District to enable him coordinate Government efforts in response to the ravaging floods in the area.

The Minister said he traveled to Kasese to assess the extent of damage and relief requirement for persons affected by floods caused by overflow by Rivers; Nyamwamba, Nyamugasani and Mubuku on May 06, 2020. All the rivers in Kasese and Bundibugyo Districts burst their banks due to heavy rainfall on the night of May 05, 2020.

Kilembe hospital was among the places gravely affected by the floods. The Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces, Uganda Police Force, and Non Governmental Organizations have been helping in the search and rescue of patients, attendants and medical workers cutoff by the floods plus the population in the neighborhood of the hospital. Local ambulance, facilitated by the joint efforts, is playing a significant role in the rescue and evacuation of the affected persons.

The floods also affected the general infrastructure and essential service provision in the affected districts. Roads and bridged were destroyed as well as electricity distribution services such as at Kasese, Kilembe mine and Tronder hydro power plants were gravely affected. Education institutions were also affected such as Bikone Primary School that was partially destroyed. Furthermore, Kanamba Health Centre lll was destroyed.

Heavy rains, flooding wreak havoc across East Africa as another storm makes its way to the region|19/06/2020|"The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is assessing the damage and launching immediate responses to help those most impacted by the storms in Kenya, South Sudan and Somalia. IRC teams in Somalia are on alert and preparing for disaster as tropical storm Kyarr makes its way towards Puntland.

As tropical storm Kyarr makes its way towards East Africa, expected to make landfall in the coming days, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) calls on the international community to mobilize quickly and ready resources to enable actors to respond to the devastation quickly and efficiently.

Higher than normal rainfall in East Africa has caused massive flooding across the region, impacting more than 1 million people in South Sudan, Kenya and Somalia, destroying crops, homes and health facilities and forcing more than 600,000 people in South Sudan and 273,000 in Somalia from their homes.

Kurt Tjossem, Vice President of East Africa at the International Rescue Committee, said,

“This impending storm is sure to compound the damage already done after weeks of heavy rains and flooding across East Africa. It will destroy homes and crops and force thousands more to flee and seek shelter and safety. The region is still reeling from a period of severe drought which left many families unable to feed their children. This further damage to life and livelihood is likely to have long lasting consequences on the most vulnerable who are only just getting back on their feet.”

The IRC is already assessing the damage done over the past days and weeks and responding in the most hard hit areas of South Sudan, Kenya and Somalia. Yesterday an assessment team reached Beledweyne, Somalia as water began to recede and began preparations to provide health and water and sanitation services to those most affected.

In South Sudan, our teams are already seeing an increase in death due to malaria, watery diarrhea and deteriorating healthcare and water and sanitation systems. In Kenya, many IRC programs in the north are halted due to damage and inaccessibility of the roads, meaning there are many communities we cannot reach with life-saving programs. We are also seeing an upsurge of cholera and damage to water systems and are working with the Kenya government to address these needs.

As this region experienced a severe drought earlier this year, more than 12 million people in Somalia, South Sudan and Kenya are already facing severe food insecurity. Crops that have been able to grow in the past few months are now destroyed which will devastate families and severely worsen access to food.

The IRC is preparing for the coming storm, but we need help from the international community, donors and policy makers to mobilize funds and send support, before this coming storm wreaks more havoc on the region.

East Africa is not going to recover from this quickly. Higher than usual rains are expected to continue through November and December leading to more floods and conditions for disease. Recovery from these weather conditions may take years.

The IRC has been working in countries across East Africa since 1989 providing healthcare, nutrition, economic recovery, women’s protection and empowerment education programming to those affected by conflict and crisis to help them survive, recover and rebuild their lives."|https://www.watchdoguganda.com/news/20191102/81853/heavy-rains-flooding-wreak-havoc-across-east-africa-as-another-storm-makes-its-way-to-the-region.html

My mansion is not invaded by frogs, snakes- Tycoon Ham speaks out on being displaced by flooding Lake Victoria|09/07/2020|"Wealthy businessman Hamis Kiggundu alias Ham has finally spoken out on claims that his multi-billion home on the shores of Lake Victoria had been raided by frogs and snakes after a heavy downpour that lead to bursting of lake’s shorelines.

In recent weeks, the lake Victoria’s water levels have risen to 13.21 metres, the second highest since 1964 when it was 13.41 metres. The lake’s wrath is now affecting encroachers, by submerging hotels, residential houses, landing sites and beaches.

Reports had claimed that Ham’s house in Kawuku, Bunga was one of those that had already been filled with water, forcing the young moneybags to run away to another home in Kampala in order to save his life.

But the tycoon has come out to dismiss such reports saying his home was yet to be flooded with waters.

According to a short statement released by Ham Enterprises (U) Limited, the tycoon’s company, Ham’s magnificent home is unaffected by the floods. “The Home is still very safe,” read the statement in part.

To prove that the house was safe, Ham Enterprises shared current pictures of the rich young man’s residence online, dismissing ones that had been shared by bloggers as fake and not depicting the current situation at the home of the Ham Enterprises (U) Limited Chief Executive Officer (CEO).

Meanwhile, the images left many admiring and wondering how Ham had managed to build such an expensive home at the age of 36. But Ham told admirers “we don’t have to go to foreign countries to fulfill our desires and dreams, we just have to adjust our mindsets based on reason and reality and work towards transformation of our motherland Uganda to what we desire.”"|https://www.watchdoguganda.com/entertainment/showbiz/20200427/91452/my-mansion-is-not-invaded-by-frogs-snakes-tycoon-ham-speaks-out-on-being-displaced-by-flooding-lake-victoria.html
Uganda in danger due to massive floods and landslides-Gov’t reveals|26/11/2019|"By Watchdog reporter

Government has revealed that the ongoing second season rainfall is heavy and above normal thus causing massive floods and landslides in the mountainous areas.

According to Martin Owor, Commissioner, Disaster Management in the office of the Prime Minister, the dangerous rains are likely to take 30 to 60 days.

He said by 30th October, the rains will begin to reduce but in the meantime he urged people whose homes are on steep slopes to shift to safe homes of relatives, friends, schools, churches or mosques.

Awor further stated that government and partners will continue to monitor the situation and deliver relief food and non-food commodities where necessary.

OPED: Why should we lose lives to floods and mudslides?|28/08/2016|"I am saddened that we continue to lose lives during rainy days in Kampala and Uganda at large. For Kampala, we have been always taught that it is made up of 7 hills which therefore suggests many valleys as well. The City has planners and so are the districts, municipalities and town councils.

What kind of planning do they do? I see culverts being re-installed during the rainy seasons and trenches, water channels being cleaned up after the rain! Why isn’t this done before the rains?

Why must the works on drainage happen during the floods? Isn’t this poor planning?

I am sure the planners know very well the topography of their areas and thus they understand well the mitigation measures to aver flooding and other related issues.Why should we lose lives to floods? Why should roads disappear instead of water after it rains?

It is unfortunate that we are taking matters lightly- we have a whole ministry for Disaster preparedness, one wonders whether they actually prepare for disasters or merely respond to it! Why should we continue losing lives over mudslides when we have the Uganda Meteorological Authority, National Environment Management Authority, Ministry for Environment, UNRA among other agencies? These agencies need to harmonise their strategies because you cannot fix a broken bridges during the rains, this has to be done much earlier before the rains!

I think we need to create a disaster commission to deal with all these issues and disband the Ministry! The Commission will go a long way in dealing with human activities that lead to the disasters, full preparation and planning prior to the disasters and public participation of the same. We need technocrats to handle such situations and not merely politicians who only fly to the disaster areas when disaster strikes to make statements.

We need to be serious and we shall save lives! The citizens too need to take preservation of the environment seriously by planting trees, practising good farming practices and engaging in climate change mitigation activities and the Ministry for Water and Environment should take lead in massive sensitisation on climate change mitigation! Let us plant more trees, let us plan for our roads better, let us stop building in swamps and collectively we shall win!

Bobi Wine donates Shs13m to Kasese flood victims|22/01/2020|"At a time when the tears of the people of Kasese who have been ravaged by the heavy downpour seems to bother not many, Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu has handed over 13 million shillings to help those affected.

On the cash donation handed over to Kasese Woman MP Winnie Kizza, Bobi Wine said that the money had been contributed by members of his People Power pressure group both within and outside Uganda.

He also extended his appreciation to those who had positively responded to the call and contributed towards bailing out the people of Kasese, saying that such is a spirit that all Ugandans should embrace at all times.

“We handed over a contribution of 13,500,000/= (Thirteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand Shillings) to Hon. Winnie Kiiza to assist our sisters and brothers who are affected by flooding in Kasese district. This money was contributed by ourselves as well as comrades in Uganda and abroad.
