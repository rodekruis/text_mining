One killed, hundreds displaced by floods|11/05/2015|"One person has died and hundreds have been displaced after river Unyama burst its banks on Thursday following heavy rains that have been experienced in most parts of the country.

The deceased only identified as Peko, a 17 year old resident of Parwaca village, Atiak Sub-county in Amuru District drowned in River Unyama as he was trying to cross from the eastern side to the western.

His body was found by residents floating near river banks on Friday and later handed to his family members for burial in Parwaca village.

Mr John Bosco Ocan, the L.C 111 chairperson Atiak Sub-county call upon government to intervene.

“We call upon Government to work on the western side of the road so that it can reduce on the level of flooding in the area as it has been done on the eastern side before it gets out of hand,” Mr Ocan said.

Mr Ochan added that several people have been displaced, transport has been put to a standstill and some houses and crops were washed away.

Some of the roads linking to Elegu area have also been blocked and access to some health centers and the sub county headquarters also made difficult especially for smale vehicles.

Mr Benard Loum, the LCI Chairperson Parwaca village has warned residents not to risk crossing the river especially when drunk adding that he suspects the deceased was drunk at the time he drowned.

Ms Grace Piloya who deals in perishable goods, says it would be difficult for some of them who are keeping orphans to cope with the situation.

“I am a single mother with seven children, five are at school. How will I pay their school fees next team if these floods continue with the losses I have incurred already?,” she wondered.

Last year, River Unyama burst its banks destroying properties worth millions of shillings and displacing hundreds of residents.

The water level which was over one meter high forced residents to put their property on rooftops to prevent them from getting wet."|http://www.acholitimes.com/2015/05/11/one-killed-hundreds-displaced-by-floods/
