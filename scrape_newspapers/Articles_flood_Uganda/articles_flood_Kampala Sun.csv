However, according to their skipper Michael Wokorach, his side is ready for the battle of pride.



“They say defending a championship is one of the hardest things but we have done it before defending five on them. We know how to do it and we are ready,” Wokorach, who will be on the sidelines due to injury vowed in a presser that launched the league hosted at their home ground.

His opponent, Joseph Aredo played it cool in the presser that saw a new title sponsor in Nile Special Stout, a new product of Nile Breweries Limited.

The new drink took over from seasoned beer brand, Nile Special which had been with rugby for almost a decade a thing Uganda Rugby Union boss, Godwin Kayangwe based on to refer to them as investment partners while receiving a dummy cheque worth Sh670m

The deal looks good on the eye a thing that raised eyebrows in the presser and on social media but Francis Nyende, Nile Special Stout brand manager assured clubs that they will be handling cash meant to reach clubs.
