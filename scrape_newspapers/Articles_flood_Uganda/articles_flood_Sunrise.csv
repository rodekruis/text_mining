US gives UGX365m for flood victims in Rwenzori|18/01/2020|"The People of Kasese and the wider Rwenzori sub region could be the last lucky beneficiaries of America’s display of kindness under outgoing Ambassador Deborah Malac as she prepares to leave the country following the end of her diplomatic service for the United States in Uganda.

In a statement to the media, the US Embassy under the leadership of Ambassador Malac is giving Catholic Relief Services US dollars 100,000, Approximately UGX 365 million to purchase essential items for an estimated 1000 people affected by the recent extensive floods and landslides that ravaged the region.

he statement notes that: “The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Uganda is awarding the international disaster assistance funds to Catholic Relief Services (CRS) to support over 1,000 flood-affected individuals in the Rwenzori sub-region. Through the USAID award, CRS will provide emergency shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), and non-food items to communities with the greatest need in Bundibugyo.”

It adds: “The immediate needs of affected populations include blankets, shelter materials, soap, jerrycans, mosquito nets, medicine to treat water- and vector-borne disease, and food assistance.”

The US embassy estimates that the last years heavy rains and flooding that began in September 2019 negatively impacted nearly 300,000 people across Uganda.

The statement further notes that: “To ensure the U.S. assistance targets the most vulnerable households, CRS will coordinate with local government officials and affected communities and consult with marginalized groups such as women, children, persons with disabilities, and the elderly to adapt programming to their specific needs and challenges. They will work with a local sub-partner, Caritas, to implement activities, with the secondary aim of strengthening Caritas’ capacity to respond to reoccurring disasters.”

USAID has pledged to continue to liaise with the Uganda government and relief agencies to determine the type and amount of potential additional assistance.

The heavy rains also devastated hundreds of thousands of people in the Elgon sub region where landslides killed dozens of people and displaced hundreds of thousands.

Ambassador Malac is set to hold her last press conference as US Ambassador to Uganda next week in which she will highlight her country’s contribution towards improving the lives of millions of people in Uganda.

In a farewell meeting with president Museveni recently, Ambassador Malac reportedly told the president that she’s ending her diplomatic service to the United States in Uganda after 39 years.

UGX20bn earmarked for flood relief|19/11/2019|"The commitment was made by the State Minister for Finance for Planning, David Bahati in Parliament who was responding to a UGX43 billion request from the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness.

Bahati said: “We shall go through the immediate items and the requests being processed we think in the next two days we should be able to release the money to the ministry.”

Bahati however said that all that money cannot be released immediately and what can be done at the moment given the cash situation is UGX20 billion to cater for the emergencies.

“Not all the money is needed now. We shall avail the shs20 million in the next two days,” Bahati said.

His commitment followwd a report by the Minister of State for Disaster Preparedness, Hon Musa Ecweru during plenary sitting on 26 November 2019.

Ecweru told parliament that there is need for an urgent response to 38,000km of district roads, 98,000km of urban roads and 79,000km of village access roads which have been destroyed by floods.

“As we talk ,the prime minister is meeting the team from the ministry of finanace is to break this down as we have broken and the total rewuirement will come to a lot of money ,something to do with about 43 billion,”he noted.

“Madam speaker the climate change is real and the entire country need to rise up to make sure that we do what we called climate change mitigation,”he said.

He explained that heavy down pour has caused water logging in many villages causing huge post-harvest destruction affected population of over eight million requires immediate shelter and relief food.

“Eighty five per cent of the population in these regions and districts are facing severe losses of livelihoods in addition to destruction of commonly used infrastructure. The Bugisu region has experienced landslides in addition to flooding,” he said.

The Speaker, Rebecca Kadaga advised the ministry to involve the district disaster committees while identifying priority areas.

“The minister should prepare a schedule of the priority areas and report to the House tomorrow,” said Kadaga.

Mps expressed their concern over the distribution of the funds saying that the ministry should ensure that all affected regions are covered.

Some memebers of parliament also blasted the ministry of finance for failure to plan for along term noting that the ministry has an hidden intention.

In October this year, the Meteorogical Department forecast that the country would experience above-normal rains between the months of September and December

Nambozo calls for quick government response towards floods and Landslides victims in Sironko District|09/12/2019|"The Sironko Woman Member of Parliament Florence Nambozo Mayoga last Week called upon the Government to speed up the response and support the landslides victims in the mountainous areas of Elgon Region.

Nambozo said that the Government should expedite the process to evacuate those in high risk hills as it continues with the permanent resettlement Programme.

She made these remarks during her visit to the families of the landslide victims in Zesui Sub County where she delivered food Aid to them.

“Accessing most parts of the landslide hit Sub Counties of Zesui and Massaba is difficult because there is still a heavy downpour in the area as roads and bridges connecting the areas have also been destroyed by landslides and the continuous heavy rains” she said

The legislator also reached the epicenter of the landslides in Bunajewa village, Bumumulo parish in Zesui Sub-County and later proceeded to Bugimago Primary School where over 200 displaced people had relocated and camped.

She delivered food relief which included 600kilograms of maize flour (Posho), 200kilograms of rice, and onion seedlings

The State Minister of Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Refugees Musa Ecweru last week told the journalists at the Uganda Media Centre that the government had launched an immediate response plan where the Cabinet had approved UGX20bn.

“This money, UGX10bn shall be given to the Ministry of Works, 9bn to the Disaster Preparedness and UGX200 for fixing equipment’s” he said

The residents of Zesui Sub County led by their Gombolola Internal Security Officer (GISO) Paul Mukwana appreciated Hon Nambozo for the good gesture of donating relief food to the people who had been affected by flash floods and landslides.

“I appreciate Hon. Nambozo’s efforts and kindness towards our people. She has proved to us that she is a people centered leader because not only that she condoled with us but also brought physical items and I thank her on behalf of the entire leadership of Zesui Sub county” he said

By press time four people died while scores were displaced in Zesui and Masaba sub counties in Sironko district following multiple landslides that occurred last week as a result of heavy rains.

Lake Victoria flooding, the boomerang effect of human activity|10/06/2020|"

Lake Victoria, Africa’s largest freshwater body is now filled up to the brim, hence the massive overflow/flooding, after centuries of sedimentation with soils, sand, urban wastes, industrial effluent, current extraordinarily heavy rains and flood-waters from the East African rivers–largely precipitated by Climate Change.

The lake is no longer just a resource for the continent’s intensive socio-economic activities, but it is increasingly becoming a victim of climate change which has been adversely impacting the Great Lakes’ region for over 20 years.

The worst case of this Global Warming effect in this densely-populated region of —never experienced in half a century—is the flooding of its shores, killing and displacing hundreds of thousands of encroachers and non-encroachers alike.

Besides centuries of sedimentation, Senior Presidential Advisor on Media, Joseph Tamale Mirundi says there are also five ships of the Uganda Railways Corporation (URC) at the bottom of Lake Victoria, after they sank over many years in marine accidents on this transboundary water body.

Mirundi, a journalist and a formerly Press Secretary to the President of Uganda at State House, has openly, in live Radio and TV talk shows, challenged the Ministry of Works and Transport, over failure to remove the ship wrecks, in which the country has lost billions worth of valuable assets and revenue.

There has never been an official dismissal of Mirundi’s long-held challenge, over which he locked horns with former Works Permanent Secretary, Charles Muganzi who once sued him [Mirundi] for defamation.

According to water experts, the lake Victorian levels have hit a new record high of 13.42 metres, surpassing the historic 13.41 highest mark ever-reached on May 12, 1964. Uganda and Kenya, are hardest-hit by flood-waters carrying large loads via rivers from Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as major depositors. This lake is a huge trans-boundary resource with about 23 supply-rivers, but has only one exit via River Nile at Jinja-Uganda.

The Kagera/Akagera is the largest river flowing into Victoria [in Uganda] through Tanzania—having eroded the mountainous Burundi and Rwanda. And from Kenya, flows in rivers: Sio, Nzoia, Yala, Nyando, Sondu Miriu, Mogusi, and Migori, while Uganda feeds Victoria via: Nyabarongo, Katonga, Ssezibwa. Other rivers converging into Lake Victoria include Simiyu-Duma, Grumeti-Rwana, Mara, and Gucha-Migori.

State Minister for Environment Beatrice Atim Anywar says over 170,000 households have been directly affected by the latest wave of flooding Lakes Victoria and Kyoga, as more land, homes and farms continue to sink under water.

She confirms that Uganda and the region are currently soaked under extraordinarily heavy rains pounding the region since 2018.

“Our experts have told us that as a result of Climate Change, these ferocious rains shall persist for the next three years. We’ve assessed the water-overflow, and it is extensive.

Both encroachers and non-encroachers are displaced and urgently need to be moved away from the shoreline to higher grounds.

“Government will resettle those genuinely displaced, but evict and prosecute encroachers,” says Anywar, a celebrated environmental/conservation defender.

She adds that Government is to erect border-marks of the gazetted 200-metre perimeter demarcation from the shoreline. “People whose developments are within 200-metres are encroachers. They’ll be evicted,” Anywar warns. She quotes the national environmental law restricting any human activities within 200 metres and 100 metres in lake-shores and river banks, respectively.

She says over time, communities have settled in these restricted wetlands, they erroneously regard as waste-lands, while others do vehicle-repair, motorcar-washing, fish-markets, sand-excavation and have cultivated the wetlands that filter/clean incoming waters.

The lake is considered shallow, with a maximum depth of approximately 80 metres (260 ft) and an average depth of 40 metres (130 ft). The Mayor of one of Uganda’s most threatened lake shore city of Entebbe, Vincent Kayanja Dipo who is a member of Lake Victoria Regional Local Authorities Co-operation (LVRLAC) whose secretariat is located in Entebbe, confirms that many parts of his city have been submerged.

“It’s very serious,” he remarked, signaling greater danger ahead in a recent interview with Mengo-based Central Broadcasting Service (CBS) radio. He says experts have informed LVRLAC that Lake Victoria’s base has been filled due to many years of sedimentation and water.

“Our governments should urgently conduct a comprehensive scientific investigation by a multi-expertise team of researchers, right from the lake’s bottom, with a view to establishing the exact magnitude of the sedimentation and recommend solutions, including desilting.

Because we suspect the lake has silted up, and cannot any longer hold extra loads of water and other sediments.” The Lake, he adds, nowadays fills up and overflows whenever it rains. As LVRLAC, we want science-based solutions, including possible desilting,” says Mayor Kayanja.

However, his counterparts, the mayors of Kampala’s divisions that border the lake have vowed to resist evictions. Eng. Nsubuga Balimwezo, the Mayor of the City’s Eastern Nakawa division vowed thus: “I’ll not accept government victimizing our residents who have lived there for 20-30 years; where was government when people settled?” His counterpart, the Mayor of the southerly Makindye Division, Ali Nganda-Mulyanyama agrees too, to protect those labeled encroachers.

But government in early 2020 issued a red alert to shoreline communities that the lake’s levels were rapidly rising, and that around February-March it would overflow its shores due to heavy unrelenting rains that begun 1-2 years ago and would climax mid-year [2020], according to state-run Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA).

However, the highly-infectious COVID-19 that struck East Africa in Feb-March 2020, has overshadowed this silent disaster quietly ravaging the region. Heavy rains in East Africa’s hinterland and within Lake Victoria basin, have left many families homeless mainly in Uganda and Kenya. The flood waters are sweeping away farmland, carrying with it crops, livestock and homes.

Also not spared are: fish-breeding and landing sites, vegetation, transport infrastructure, holiday beaches/resorts and hotels mainly in the two countries.

However, regional lake authorities have expressed concern and proposed strategies to solve the water upsurge. The LVRLAC in Entebbe and the Kisumu-based Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC), have proposed emergency measures to avert more deaths and destruction.

Today, about 30 million people in Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania rely on the lake for fishing, irrigation and, in Uganda, electricity. Huge population growth is expected in the region. All these people will increasingly rely on the lake for a very long time to come. LVBC Executive Secretary, Ali-Said Matano says urgent action is needed to support over 200,000 people already displaced in Kenya and Uganda.

Authorities in Uganda are warning of forceful eviction of encroachers as one of the first steps to managing the challenge. Environment State Minister Anywar and her Executive Director of the state-run National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), Dr. Tom Okurut, say the affected residents including vendors must leave the encroached land before evictions.

Okurut said cholera, bilharzia and malaria have broken out, a reason they’ve ordered people to leave. But a private water engineer, Apollo Buregyeya argues that government protection of the environment is wrongly premised:

“….Its not only swamps you should protect. The marshlands are equally important to the stability and regulation of the lake water levels. They store a lot of water and release it to the lake at a rate only nature can predict.

They also work like the kidneys of the lake system. When you give them away for rice-farming, you shift the equilibrium of both the water-quality and the water levels of the lake. Please stop the rice farms at Lwera. It doesn’t matter what your experts at NEMA tell you. They are not good custodians,” he told off government ministries and its agencies.

However, towards end of May, one of the biggest fish-landing sites, Mulungu located near Kampala, was evicted. Ggaba, a nearby site, is next in line of fire before end of June, say officials in NEMA and Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA).

Other impacts of the rising water levels are; dislodgement of papyrus mats technically known as suds, from the encroached shorelines resulting into huge mass of floating Islands which are dangerous to hydropower infrastructure and transportation on the lake.

Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni recently rushed to the eastern River Nile source city of Jinja, where floating vegetation eroded by the river, interrupted electric power generation and plunged the whole country into a blackout, after trees and grasses blocked water from flowing into the turbines of Nalubale dam.

Then President Museveni assured the nation that extra damage that could have been caused by the rise in the lake level, was averted because Uganda has expanded the exit gates to spill water into River Nile [and onwards to the Mediterranean Sea]. In 1964 when the water level reached 13.41 metres, there was only one exit gate allowing out only 1,300 cubic metres per second.

Today, Uganda has two exit gates, and now releases up to 3,000 cubic metres of water. “….it [water] will not damage our dams but people near the shore and river banks should get out, they could be swallowed up…. People should settle 500 meters from the shore,” says the Ugandan President. The country’s only airport highway is also threatened with submerging by the lake’s waters. The lake’s level at this point is 13.40 metres high.

Lake Victoria occupies 236,000 square kilometres and serves 35 million people, who mainly live in lake basin’s major urban areas of: Kampala, Jinja, Entebbe, Kisumu, Mwanza, Musoma and Bukoba cities in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, respectively.

These get their water, fish, electricity and sand supplies among others from the lake, but give back urban and human wastes, hotel and factory effluent and chemical pollutants. In addition, land degradation especially its encroached wetlands where huge soil amounts are eroded daily, end up in this moderately deep lake.

This, officials say, have filled up the lake—a key reason for the current fierce water backflow, bringing with it snakes, crocodiles, fish, crabs, mosquitoes and snails. Some islands are also sinking—part of where the broken-off pieces of land currently floating on the lake—are coming from, like the palm oil-rich Kalangala and pineapple-ladden Bussi islands.

East Africa’s only Ngamba chimpanzee sanctuary in Uganda, is one of those islands facing the threat of being submerged. Farmers and fisherfolk are the hardest-hit by this unending calamity.

According to the Water and Environment Ministry, the water level rose up from the average 12.00 meters to 13.32 meters as of 30th April 2020, and in May to 13.42 metres.

The rise of 1.42 meters was attained in a period of 6 months. In spite of the losses and threats, the Ugandan leader June 4, 2020 contradicted his recent directive for destruction of all wetland encroachments, when he expressed a soft spot for industrial establishments.

“It isn’t wise to destroy industries in wetlands as they’re very expensive to build and they provide jobs to our youths,” Museveni remarked in a State of the Nation Address.

This was a major digression from his recent directive to the Water and Environment Ministry, to take drastic action against all encroachers. Uganda’s inland lake, Kyoga [in eastern region]—a recipient of waters from Victoria via River Nile—too has overflowed her shores and submerged large tracts of farms, homes, fishing villages and roads.

The historic entry-point of Euro-Christian missionaries into Uganda in 1800s, the Kigungu Shrine, in Entebbe, is the latest loss of an asset to be submerged under Lake Victoria’s water. There is no quantified monetary cost/impact of the regional destruction so far, but officials quote it in billions of dollars.
