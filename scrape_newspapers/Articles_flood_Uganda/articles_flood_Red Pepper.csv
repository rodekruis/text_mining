Nairobi – Kenya Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr. Fred Matiang’i now says the government has begun forcefully evicting people out of areas prone to flooding following the heavy rains witnessed in the country in recent weeks.

This comes as the government on Wednesday, May 6 announced that 30 people had died within the last 24 hours of flooding, bringing the total tally over the last three weeks to 194.

CS Matiang’i, speaking during a press address in Nairobi on Wednesday, said security apparatus in the flood hit areas, especially in the North Eastern and Eastern regions, had already been given the green light to use force where necessary.

The tough-talking CS said negotiation with residents of such areas was not working saying: “…as public leaders we have a responsibility to protect lives and so we would rather negotiate with you when you’re alive.”

“We have instructed the County Commissioners and the county security teams in Garissa and Tana River to move everyone away; even if it means putting them on lorries ourselves and getting them out of danger,” said Matiang’i.

He, however, urged them to abide by the government directives and relocate out of their own volition rather than waiting to be moved.

“We have given instructions to our regional security team in North Eastern and parts of Eastern and Coast to begin moving people. We are not waiting for people to be swept downstream, we are moving some people away from danger using public resources,” he said"|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2020/05/govt-to-forcibly-evict-kenyans-in-flood-hit-areas/

Kampala flooding Inks Ugandans, New City|09/11/2018|"Kampala City flooding is common whenever it rains but this time round residents are starting debate as to whether we need a well planned City.

Sarah Bireete a Kampala resident posted on her facebook page about her thoughts on Kampala floods this morning.

“Good Morning Uganda – a Country where floods wreak havoc in the city every time it rains. This morning, as I moved from Wakiso to Kampala, I realized that we can as well promote tourism through abrupt waterfalls caused by vehicles during simple rain because of a poor drainage system! Many lives have been lost in these city floods through people and small vehicles getting stuck in manholes! THE BIG QUESTION: Can we have a proper drainage system in greater Kampala as one of President M7’s legacy infrastructure projects?”.

AGENCIES | BBC | Flooding as a result of recent heavy rains has killed more than 260 people across East Africa.

Kenya has been the hardest hit with the government recording 194 deaths.

In Rwanda, 55 people have died and floods have killed 16 in Somalia. In Uganda high water levels have trapped an estimated 200 patients inside a hospital.

East African countries have also been hit by a locust invasion and Covid-19.

The authorities in Kenya have told people in some of the affected areas to move away from “potential danger”.

The water has also washed away 8,000 acres of crops and some vital infrastructure, the government has said.

Meteorologists predict that the heavier than usual rains will continue throughout May, reports the BBC’s Patience Atuhaire in Uganda’s capital, Kampala. The rainy season normally lasts until June.

n Rwanda, people died as a result of landslides in the mountainous north-west of the country.

Houses, roads and crops were all destroyed and hundreds remain homeless, mayors of the affected districts have told the BBC’s Great Lakes service.

What’s the latest from Uganda?

In western Uganda, a river burst its banks causing people to flee for safety to the town of Kasese.

At the nearby Kilembe hospital, rescuers are trying to reach the trapped patients and take them to a church.

In recent weeks, water levels in Lake Victoria have reach an unprecedented height, forcing shoreline communities to abandon their homes and causing erosion along the River Nile, which is fed by the lake.

Last month, a huge floating island of loose vegetation led to a nationwide blackout in Uganda after clogging a turbine in a hydroelectric power station.

At the end of last year, rain-triggered disasters, including flash floods and landslides, killed at least 250 people and affected some three million people across East Africa."|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2020/05/kenya-somalia-and-rwanda-ravaged-by-deadly-flooding/

MTN Uganda Donates Start-up kits for Kasese Floods Victims|13/05/2020|"MTN Uganda CEO, Wim Vanhelleputte (L) displays the contents of the relief kits that will be distributed to the flood victims in Kasese district

Kampala – Telecom giants, MTN Uganda through its Corporate Social Responsibility arm, the MTN Foundation donated UGX 41M towards the Kasese floods victims.

The telecom revealed that the funds were to be used to buy non-food relief items to support the families that have been displaced.

The devastating floods ensued after River Nyamwamba burst its banks, following the heavy rains that hit the Rwenzori Mountain ranges.

Over 24,760 households with approximately 173,320 people were affected by the flash floods. Almost up to 150 houses were destroyed in Karusandara division while another 92 houses were completely washed away in Nyamwamba and kilembe areas.

The displaced people have sought shelter from nearby churches and school buildings following a directive from Hon. Musa Ecweru, the state Minister for Relief and Disaster Preparedness during his visit to the area last week.

It is against this premise MTN Uganda, through it’s foundation that aims at improving the lives of the communities within which it operates by supplementing government efforts in priority areas including disaster responses has urgently come in to reach out to the Kasese floods victims with relief aid.

While handling over the dummy cheque to the Red Cross and Officials from the office of the Prime Minister, MTN Uganda’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Wim Vanhelleputte remarked that facing such a disaster in these unprecedented times when the globe is grappling with the Covid19 pandemic and the country in a state of lock-down, spells double tragedy for the people of Kasese, thus prompting urgent relief from MTN and all other stakeholders to save the lives of people.

Mr. Vanhelleputte made the remarks while handing over a dummy cheque at the Nyonyi Gardens MTN offices in Kampala on Monday.

Wim further expressed MTN’s heartfelt sympathy to the people of Kasese.

“As MTN Uganda, we stand with the people of Kasese who have suffered great loss in the recent heavily destructive flash floods. We understand that this is such a trying time, especially since we are already battling the devastating effects of the Covid19 pandemic. We hope that this modest support we have rendered will offer them some comfort,”

While receiving the cheque, Robert Kwesiga, Uganda Red Cross Secretary General appreciated MTN for always coming through very fast to support whenever the Country has emergences.

“This is not the first time MTN Uganda has supported people affected by disasters. Last year they supported Bududa twice, supported Bundibugyo and today they are supporting Kasese. This consistent commitment is a true humanitarian spirit exhibited by MTN to support it’s community.

Amidst this period when all partners including MTN have heavily invested in the COVID-19 fight, MTN has still managed to support Kasese. We want to thank you.” Kwesiga said.

The money shall be used to procure 100 standard household non-food-item kits to reach out to 100 most vulnerable families comprising of children, youths, women and the elderly.

Each of the kits contains 2 cooking pots, 6 cups, 6 plates, 1 knife, 1 ladle, 2 jerry cans, 3 blankets, 3 mosquito nets, 3 bars of soap and 1 tarpaulin for shelter.

In 2013, the MTN foundation spent about 250m to support the kilembe mines hospital which had been affected by similar floods through refurbishment of the children and maternal ward and provided items to support the hospital inclusive of 100 hospital beds, mattresses, mosquito nets as well a generator.

On behalf of the Government of Uganda, the Ag. Commissioner for Disaster Preparedness Ms. Rose Nakabugo extended warm heartfelt appreciation to MTN Foundation for the support to the people of Kasese. “This is very timely. We thank MTN and commit that the donated items will right away be delivered to Kasese to help people cope through this situation. Thank you for complimenting our efforts.”"|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2020/05/mtn-uganda-donates-start-up-kits-for-kasese-floods-victims/

Mourners heading to Kitwekyanjovu village in Lwengo district to attend the burial of Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIGP) Andrew Felix Kaweesi were this morning hampered by heavy rains that flooded the muddy roads to Lwengo.

Kaweesi was gunned down with his bodyguard CPL. Kenneth Erau and driver Godfrey Mambuwa in Kulambiro, Kampala, on Friday by unknown gunmen who were travelling on two motorcycles.

After a requiem mass at Lubaga Cathedral in Kampala yesterday, his remains were airlifted in a police chopper to his ancestral home in Kitwekyanjovu, Kyazanga sub-county in Lwengo district, where he is set to be laid to rest.

More than 50 people have died and thousands left homeless after severe flooding caused by torrential rain in the south-west of Democratic Republic of Congo.

This happened on Thursday when the torrential rain caused the Kalamu River, which flows through the city of Boma, to burst its banks.

The bodies of some of the victims had ended up in neighbouring Angola, after being carried away by the surge, a local governor said.

Locals said that some areas of the city were buried in up to a metre of mud.

“This is a cyclical phenomenon which happens every 10 years. It last happened in January 2015, but with climate change it’s now happened again in December 2016,” Jacques Mbadu, governor of Kongo Central province, told AFP news agency.

Waters hit a peak of 2m (six ft) above their usual level, he added.

The United Nations says more than 600,000 people have been displaced in Ethiopia since March, largely because of flooding.

The African country was struggling with its worst drought in decades in 2015, but it ended when spring rains arrived in March.

On Wednesday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said nearly 300,000 people were forced to flee their homes between March and June due to flooding.

The report further said that others were stranded due to the inter-communal conflict in Ethiopia’s southern Oromia and Somali regions.

Many of the people displaced by flooding have since returned home, the UN said, noting that more than 10,000 families are still stranded and in need of basic household items and emergency shelter.

The UN office also noted that heavy rainfall has delayed the delivery of emergency food aid to 85,000 flood-affected people in Somali region.

The UN highlighted that further rain and flooding are predicted due to the La Nina weather phenomenon.

“If the La Nina event begins in late August, this may entail heavier than normal rainfall in the El Nino-affected highland areas, which may result in intensified flooding,” the world body said, adding the phenomenon’s impact could be felt in Oromia and Somali regions by December."|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2016/08/floods-displace-hundreds-of-thousands-in-ethiopia/

Sorghum grains worldwide are famous for making the best alcohol brew. And for the Bafumbira and Banyarwanda, a distinctive brew called ‘Umushururu’ served in homes, parties and bars is the number one way to crack deals, initiate relationships, settle scores and overcome their “traditional reserve”.

So according to Edgar Mfite Niyimpa, the chairperson of the organizing committee for the first Bafumbira reunion on Sunday 18th December 2016 at Mitra Square in Lugala, the event and cause is of significant importance.

“We are going to awakening the sleeping lion and create a link to development.

As Bafumbira, we have to come together, celebrate our culture. Many of us have grown up and schooled in Kampala and other districts outside Kigezi so we need a chance to network with our kinsmen people from different professions through folk activities like kwivuga (poetry), our local dance called isangane, enjoy local food, brew and have some team building games like break calabashes like our ancestors used to during their gatherings,” Mr. Mfite who works at Uganda Bureau of Statistics said.

“All Bafumbira, Banyarwanda, in-laws and neighbors from Kabale, Kanungu, Kamwengye and beyond should come and celebrate,” he said adding, “Just know people will be spoilt for choice with the Kifumbira performances, T-shirts, hoodies (for adults and kids), vests and other traditional themed items which will be exhibited on Sunday for only UGx. 30,000.”

Many prominent Bafumbira in town and from allover the country like Uganda Prisons quota boss Hillary Bisanga, UBOS boss Dr. Chris Mukiza, Eng.

Photos: How Floods Paralyzed Karamoja|11/09/2014|"A week of heavy rains in Karamoja has left rivers severely flooded and made many roads impassable.

Many motorists have been forced to take longer, round about routes. Traffic is also building up on many bridges across the sub-region.

There are people trapped by the floods because roads have cut off their homes. The most affected roads are Moroto – Mbale via Nakapiripirit and Moroto-Kotido roads in South Karamoja.

Recently, the meteorological department in its forecast warned that the rains in the Eastern part of Uganda would not be destructive but normal. However, the region is receiving heavier rains than anticipated."|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2014/09/phots-how-floods-paralyzed-karamoja/
El-Niño Alert: Prepare For Floods and Landslides|03/12/2014|"Uganda National Meteorology Authority has issued an El Nino alert calling for preparation for preparation of the members of the public for the occurrence of the adverse weather event.

According to the alert, El Nino is expected to occur between December 2014 and February 2015. El Niño is a weather condition characterized by unusually long rainfall conditions with the possibility of flooding and landslides.

Jackson Rwakishaija, the Acting Executive Director Uganda National Meteorological Authority says there are adequate factors putting the probability of occurrence at up to 70 percent.

He says the Pacific Ocean has shown renewed signs of El Nino development in recent weeks adding that, above average temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean typical of El Nino conditions have warmed further in the last fortnight.

The World Meteorological Station concurs with the authority. It says the Southern Ocean Oscillation Index has generally been in excess of El Nino thresholds in the past three months.

According to Rwakishaija, not all factors responsible for development of El Nino have been satisfied.

He says regardless of whether or not El Nino fully develops, warmer than average tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures combined with cooler waters currently observed to the north of Australia increases the chance of El Nino like impacts over the East African region.

Rwakishaija concludes that this suggests above average rainfall during the month of December and January over Uganda. The authority warns that when the predicted El Nino comes, it will be stormy accompanied by strong winds and sometimes hail stones.

Uganda’s capital Kampala has been experiencing heavy rains in recent weeks that resulted into flooding. El Niño conditions tend to occur once in every five years.

The last severe El Nino in Uganda occurred in 2006 causing massive flooding in Teso, Lango and Acholi regions. Mountainous areas like Sironko, Kapchorwa, Mbale, Bundibugyo and Kabale face the increased risk of landslides during severe El Nino. The Alert comes as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned the world of the worst climate conditions ahead.

Dr. Rajendra Kumhar Pachauri, the head of United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change told negotiators in Lima Climate talks that the increase in temperatures observed in 2014 is much more than any observed in the last 10 years.

In neighboring Kenya, the Meteorological Department has reported that there will be abnormal rains in many parts of the country till next year.

James G. Kongoti, the acting Director of Kenya Meteorological Services and permanent representative of Kenya at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says the October to December season indicates that much of the country is likely to experience enhanced rainfall.

He attributes this to the expected evolution of global sea surface temperatures that is favorable for the development of a weak El Nino during the season.

According to the Kenya Meteorological Department, the sea surface temperatures off the East African coastline are expected to revert to neutral conditions early in the season."|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2014/12/el-nino-alert-prepare-for-floods-and-landslides/
Egyptians Flood Streets To Protest Against Sisi Government|19/06/2014|"Egyptians have once again protested against the government of the newly elected President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

Hundreds of protesters took to the streets in the country’s second largest city, Alexandria, on Wednesday, condemning the military-led ouster of former president Mohamed Morsi and calling for his reinstatement.

A similar demonstration took place in Qalyubia Province, north of the capital Cairo, where protesters expressed support for the ousted president and called for his return to power.

The protesters also slammed the military-backed government of Sisi for its clampdown on supporters of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood movement. They also condemned a recent decision by an Egyptian court to sentence a dozen of the group’s leaders and members to death.

The 12 were sentenced to death on Wednesday on charges of being linked to the deadly shooting of Major General Nabil Farag last year. The court’s ruling comes days after Sisi was sworn in as Egypt’s new president.

Egypt has been the scene of anti-government protests with persistent clashes between security forces and demonstrators since the army ouster of Morsi in July last year.

Rights groups say the army’s clampdown on the supporters of Morsi has left over 1,400 people dead and thousands jailed. Hundreds of the former president’s supporters have also been sentenced to death so far.

Sisi’s presidency places Egypt back in the hands of a top military official just three years after a popular uprising against Hosni Mubarak, an air force officer who ruled the North African country for nearly three decades."|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2014/06/egyptians-flood-streets-to-protest-against-sisi-government/

Floods Ravage Ntoroko|19/09/2014|"Residents of Ntoroko district are crying out for help following floods that have ravaged the district.

For the past two weeks, more than 1,000 families had been displaced by the floods after River Semiliki burst its banks. The displaced people are from the four sub counties of Bweramule, Butungama, Rwebisengo, and Kanara.

The floods have also displaced over 300 cattle farmers who got stranded with their animals and several crop gardens are destroyed. Some of the roads leading to schools have also been submerged by the water forcing some schools to temporarily close.

Gerald Byaruhanga, a farmer says that since the floods ravaged the area, they haven’t received any help from the district authorities. He says that his acres of cocoa gardens were destroyed by the floods, which has affected his income. Byaruhanga, whose house was also washed away by floods, says that accommodating his family is now a big problem and is left with no option but to sleep out.

Residents in the flood affected areas are also scared of an outbreak of cholera after all the pit latrines were washed way. Gerald Mutooro, a resident of Rukora village in Karugutu Sub County, says that residents in the area have resorted to defecating in the waters, exposing the community to diarrhea and other diseases.

Mutooro, who is a member of the village health team (VHT), says they are planning to construct new pit latrines, but it’s impossible since the whole area is submerged in water.

Steven Mumbere, the Kanara LC 3 chairman, says that the floods affected more than 500 residents of Kabimbiri I and II villages and Haibale zone in Haibale parish, Kayanja, Bweramule and Kyapa villages in Bweramule parish and Rukora village in Rukora parish. He says that the affected people have decided to seek temporal shelter in the churches and schools.

Robert Kamuhanda, the Ntoroko district environment officer, attributes the floods to the uncontrolled human activities by the cattle keepers on the banks of River Semuliki, forcing it to burst. Kamuhanda says that the district had started a campaign to plant trees on the river banks to help in controlling the floods, but it stalled due to lack of funds.

Timothy Kyamanywa, the Ntoroko district LC5 Chairperson, says that the district has written to the Ministry for relief and disaster preparedness and are waiting for support. Kyamanywa also says that the district disaster management committee lacks funds to help those displaced by the floods. He says that funds are needed to purchase food and tents to shelter the flood victims."|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2014/09/floods-ravage-ntoroko/

Kasese Flood Victims Struggle to Come to Terms with Disaster|09/05/2013|"Flood victims in Kasese district are living in a state of desperation as they come to terms with last week’s disaster.

Two camps for the victims have been set up at Kasese Primary School in Kasese municipality and Kyanjuki in Kilembe.

At Kasese Primary School, there are more than 3,000 flood victims. The victims look miserable as they ponder their next move.

The victims have occupied the classrooms, where they spend the night. They sleep on the floor with no beddings or mattresses. The sanitation at the camp is also appalling. The latrines have all filled up, forcing the victims to use the toilets of the town council offices.

Geoffrey Muhindo (65), a resident of Kilembe quarters, says that he had never imagined that he would spend the night in the cold. Muhindo’s property was all washed away by the floods. He pitifully recalls the comfortable life he lived with his family as he surveys their new surroundings.

Muhindo also says that he has lost hope following the destruction caused to his crops by the floods. He says that even if the situation stabilizes, it will become next to impossible for him to send his children to school because he has nothing to sell.

Gertrude Masika (46) says that she has no hope of returning to her home in Kisenyi village, Karusandara Sub County soon. Yet Masika is having a hard time adjusting to life in the camp. She says that there is inadequate water supply, food shortage and lack of privacy especially for the women.

Masika however says that despite the suffering at the camp, she is happy that she is alive, unlike three of her friends, who have been missing since the flood struck last week.

Some of the displaced children at the camp have also resorted to begging on the streets of Kasese.

Timothy Masereka, the head of the camp, says that some of the flood victims have threatened to abandon the camp, because of the conditions. He says that many people fear they could starve to death, because of limited food supply.

Masereka says that they have requested the Red Cross and district authorities to send more food to the camp and provide mobile toilets, since the number of displaced persons keeps on increasing every day.

According to the Uganda Red Cross, more than 15,000 people have been displaced by the floods."|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2013/05/kasese-flood-victims-struggle-to-come-to-terms-with-disaster/
Kilembe Mines Hospital Closed After Floods|02/05/2013|"Kilembe Mines Hospital in Kasese has been temporarily closed following the Wednesday floods.

The heavy downpour that started on Wednesday morning forced water downstream to villages in low-lying areas.

The Medical Superintendent, Edward Wafula says that the facility will remain closed until rehabilitation on some of the facilities like the medical store, kitchen, surgery rooms, private wards, and the drug store, which were all washed away during the floods, is done.

Wafula told Uganda Radio Network that some of the patients have been transferred to Kasese Municipal health centre III, Bwera hospital and Kagando hospital.

Several relatives of the patients were seen at the compound of the hospital carrying the patients to ambulances and other vehicles, to be transferred. They were accompanied by some medical workers of Kilembe hospital.

Francis Muhindo, a resident of Rugendebara Sub County, says that he had brought his wife to give birth. He says that he is worried about her health and that of the baby as she has to travel a long distance to Bwera hospital, where she has been transferred after the floods.

Muhindo says that the hospital management should have set up temporarily structure at the hospital to handle emergency cases.

On Wednesday, medical workers at the hospital struggled to evacuate the patients who included pregnant women and children from the wards that were flooded. Some patients were removed from the surgical, children and emergency wards.

Meanwhile the bodies of the four people who were killed by the floods have been recovered.

In a telephone interview, Godfrey Kabyanga, the Mayor Kasese Municipal Council identified the dead as Paddy Karunsi, Gad Mbusa, a teacher at Kakiri Primary School identified as Kibuzu and Grace Kabugho, all residents of Kanyaruboga in Bulembia division in Kasese Municipal Council. The four bodies were found trapped in the mud.

According to Kabyanga, they are searching for two residents from the same area, who are still missing.

This morning, workers of the Red Cross from Kasese and Kabarole erected tents for the displaced people who have temporarily camped at Kisementi in Kilembe Township.

Elijah Muzigiti, the chairperson Kasese Red Cross Society, told Uganda Radio Network in a telephone interview that more than 900 people have been displaced by the floods. Most of the displaced are from Kyanjukli and Kanyaruboga villages in Kasese Municipal Council.

Red Cross spokesperson Catherine Ntabadde confirms that at least 432 homes have been affected by the floods. 200 of these homes have been completely destroyed.

On Wednesday, the floods hit the district after River Nyamwamba burst its banks, submerging several homes.

The floods cut off the Kasese-Fort Portal Road, leaving many vehicles and people stranded.

Several houses in areas along the banks of River Nyamwamba were submerged, leaving their occupants stranded.

Parts of the Nyakasanga Airfield and the neighbouring playfield, all in Kasese town were also cut off.

Opposition MPs To Visit Flood Hit Kasese District|07/05/2013|"Opposition Members of Parliament will this Friday visit Kasese district that has been hit by devastating floods in the recent days, according to Nandala Mafabi, the Leader of Opposition in parliament.

Mafabi revealed this on Tuesday afternoon on social media platform Facebook (The Hon. Nandala Mafabi Nathan – A Leader of Our Generation page) saying “This Friday a delegation of the Opposition Members of Parliament will head to Kasese.”. He however fell short of giving details of the visit.



It is a good gesture by the government’s antagonists and will go a long way in showing the Kasese district people that the former’s business is not all about verbal opposition to the government.

This comes after at least 8 people have been confirmed to have died in the floods and reports that the Mubuku river bridge that links Kasese district to Kabarole was on the verge of collapsing.

Following the floods, disaster management officials stopped trucks carrying more than five tones from crossing Mubuku bridge. Maj. Gen. Julius Oketta, the national coordinator of emergency operations in the Office of the Prime Minister says that only light vehicles are being allowed to cross the bridge.

Oketta says police has been instructed to divert heavy trucks at Busega round about not to take Fort-Portal-Kasese road but instead go through Mbarara as the best alternative. He says that police has also been deployed at Kasese round about to divert heavy trucks from the Democratic Republic of Congo not to use the Kasese-Fort Portal road."|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2013/05/opposition-mps-to-visit-flood-hit-kasese-district/
Reconstruction of Flood Hit Kasese Kicks off|10/05/2013|"Repair of some of the infrastructure that was destroyed during last week’s floods in Kasese district has kicked off.

Several infrastructure including roads, bridges and buildings were destroyed by the floods, which killed 8 people and displaced more than 3,000 people.

What used to be an area where the Kilembe Hospital Nurses Quarters were located has been replaced by water and heavy rocks. The quarters were all washed away by the floods. The road has been severely cracked.

The ever busy road to Kilembe mines and hospital has been deserted and replaced by the sound of fast flowing water.

At Kilembe Mines hospital, which was badly affected by the floods, construction works are going on. Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces from the construction department were fixing the roofs of some of the wards, while hospital workers were removing mud and water from the wards.

Major General Julius Oketta, the coordinator of rescue and emergency relief services in Kasese, who is supervising the renovation of the damaged infrastructure, told the media that if there are no rains this week, they hope to complete renovation next week and the hospital will be open to the public.

Dr Edward Wafula, the medical superintendent, says that only one private ward and the general ward will be opened before the weekend. He however says that they have requested the Ministry of Health for funds to construct another mortuary, pediatric ward and purchase another X- ray machine, which were all destroyed.

Five temporary bridges are also under construction in Bulembia, Karusandara and Katiri, to enable people access health facilities and schools. Oketta says that they plan to complete construction of the bridges before the beginning to the second term, to enable teachers and children access schools.

In a telephone interview, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) Kasese station engineer, Kennedy Kasawuli, says that permanent bridges will be reconstructed after assessment has been done by engineers from the Ministry of Works.

He also says that they are waiting for supplies and equipment to help re-direct the water from the river, which changed its course.

AMURU: Flood Victims Yet To Receive Relief Aid|09/08/2013|"Flood victims in Amuru district are yet to get relief aid, three days after being displaced.

River Unyama burst its banks on Tuesday night and displaced more than 6,000 people at Ilegu town council at the Uganda-South Sudan border.

The river burst its banks following days of torrential rains. The flash floods from the river washed away 200 homesteads leaving at least 6, 500 people homeless.

The floods also destroyed property worth millions of shillings and left four people injured.

A rescue team led by the Police Fire Brigade, the Uganda Red Cross Society and a team from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) were deployed in the area to conduct rescue operations.

However by 4pm on Thursday, the victims were yet to get relief aid.

Nyuma Flamine, an elder and victim of the floods said they were still waiting for relief aid that had been promised to them by the OPM.

Nyuma, who lost his household property to the floods, said they urgently need food and clean drinking water. He expresses fear of a likely outbreak of water-borne diseases in the area if no urgent intervention is taken to improve on water and sanitation.

Currently residents help themselves in a nearby stream which also doubles as a water source.

The victims who include children and the elderly yesterday spent a night in the cold. By Thursday evening the local authorities from Amuru had offered them a nearby parking yard which was not flooded.

The victims had started setting up temporal structures to use as shelter.

Maj. General Julius Oketta, the Coordinator of Disaster Preparedness in the OPM said food and non food items had been dispatched from Kampala and were expected in Ilegu by the time of filing this report.

Oketta said a medical team had also been deployed to attend to the victims.

Ilegu is a popular border market frequented by traders from Uganda, Kenya and Southern Sudan. The centre which began a year ago today has more than 6000 residents who are mostly traders.

Flood Hit Districts Struggle to Repair Damage|15/05/2013|"Districts in Rwenzori region are struggling to repair their infrastructure that was damaged by the recent floods caused by heavy down rains. In the past two weeks, the region has been experiencing heavy rains. As a result, many roads have become impassable as several bridges were washed away affecting service delivery.

However, the districts lack funds to rehabilitate the roads and bridges. The most affected are Buheesi and Kisomoro sub-counties which are popular for bananas, vegetables and fruits growing. In Kabonero and Buhesi Sub County, two bridges were washed away leaving farmers stuck with their produce as they cannot access markets. The Kibota-Mugusu road, which leads farmers and traders to Mugusu market, is impassable. The road can only be used by bicycles and motorcycles.

Moses Mwirumubi, a farmer in Buhesi Sub County says that he has failed to access the market to sell his bananas and tomatoes for past one week. Mwirumubi says that his daily income has reduced from 100,000 shillings to 30,000 shillings since he uses a bicycle to transport bananas in small quantities to the market, unlike in the past when he was using a truck.

In Kisomoro, the Nsoro Bridge used by residents to access Kisomoro Health Centre III was also washed away by the floods. Prossy Nyakaoojo, a resident of Nsoro says patients especially those in need of immediate attention and expectant mothers are finding it difficult to access the health centre.

She says that some patients are forced to go to Kibiito health centre III which is 12 kilometers away. Expectant mothers have turned to traditional birth attendants who are easily accessible.

Patrick Rwakatama, the Kabarole district engineer says that they require more than 700 million shillings to repair bridges and roads. Rwakatama says that the district also lacks funds to set up temporarily bridges to ease the transport problem.

Joan Nakityo, the deputy Chief Administrative Officer Kabarole, says the 3.2 billion shillings that was allocated to the road sector in the 2012/2013 financial year was used up. She also says that money generated from local revenue collection is not enough to fund the repairs.

Nakityo appeals to residents to be patient saying the roads and bridges will be worked on in the next financial year. Kyejonjo and Bundibugyo districts need 800 and 500 million shillings respectively to repair the road network."|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2013/05/flood-hit-districts-struggle-to-repair-damage/

River Unyama, which flows past Elegu trading centre, has burst its banks into the trading centre.

The incident has left travellers in about eight buses, trailers, trucks and small cars unable to continue either to Gulu or proceed to Juba.

Willy Katende, the General Secretary of the Uganda Bus Drivers and Allied Association (UBDAA) who is also trapped said they have not been able to move since 11am, Saturday and progressively even walking around to find food is becoming a problem.

Katende said the road had been turned into a flowing river, which has cut off the even the police station. A four wheel drive police patrol car was seen moving around to rescue their trapped personnel.

This seasonal river which is common in the Karamoja region was last seen in Elegu border nine years ago.

Katende said there was growing concern as to what will happen at night now that it has started raining in the area. Weary travellers are often forced to climb and sleep in trees, trying to find a dry spot to rest.

Lodges at the border have also been submerged by the water.

Katende said that the only way out of the place is to be airlifted, otherwise at night people will have to climb trees to escape being washed away.

Experts Warn Of More Floods In Kasese|14/10/2013|"Environmental experts in Kasese district are warning of more floods if sand mining on the banks of River Nyamwamba doesn’t stop.

Sand is mined on a stretch of land from Nyakasanga to Kanyangaya parishes in Nyamwamba, which is five kilometres from the river.

In a report produced by the Kasese district natural resources department, most of the sand that is used for construction work in Kasese town is being mined from the banks of the river which has forced the river to change its course.

In May, floods ravaged the district leaving six people dead and property worth billions of shillings destroyed.

Evelyn Mugume, the Kasese district environment officer, says illegal sand mining near the river has diverse effects on the surrounding surface and ground water. Mugume also says the bridge that connects Nyakasanga Ward to Rukooki along the Kasese- Fort Portal highway is also on the risk of collapsing, since it has been weakened by the people who are mining sand under it.

Mugume says the district has started massive sensitization of the population in Kasese Municipality through radio programmes, community dialogues and seminars, about the effects of mining on the banks of the river.

Seliveriyo Mukobi, the Kasese municipal council environment officer, says they have on several occasions warned people to stop illegal mining, but all in vain. He says mining is done at night because the miners fear to be arrested by law enforcement officers.

But Joseph Mwesige, 35, says he can’t stop sand mining because it’s his only source of income. He says that he earns between 40,000 to 60,000 shillings every day.

In June, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) carried out a survey which indicated that River Nyamwamba is also facing the risk of drying up if district authorizes don’t come up with measures of controlling the increasing human activities being carried along the river banks.

The report suggests that trees should be planted along the banks and sand mining should be carried out 300 meters away from the river bed.

In August, Kasese municipal council passed a resolution to evict all the sand miners along the river banks, but the resolution has never been implemented."|https://www.redpepper.co.ug/2013/10/experts-warn-of-more-floods-in-kasese/
Sudan: Floods Leave 36 Dead|12/08/2013|"Heavy rain and flooding in a region north of Sudan’s capital Khartoum have killed 36 people, state media says.

“Thirty-six people were killed in Nile state and 5,000 houses were destroyed because of heavy rain and floods,” Sudan’s Radio Omdurman reported on Sunday.

Khartoum and the surrounding region were hit by heavy rains on Friday, after earlier flooding which started on August 1. However, Sunday report did not mention over what time period the fatalities took place.

The rain and lightening on Friday continued about four hours in the capital and affected even modern buildings.

The United Nations had earlier reported that downpours and flash floods in Khartoum and other parts of the African country left 11 people dead and affected almost 100,000 others in August.

According to data cited by the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), eight of the 11 deaths occurred in the greater Khartoum area.

The OCHA said that in addition to the capital region and Nile state the rain swamped five other states in Sudan.

The data also indicated that over 14,000 houses had been destroyed or damaged in the affected states.

But before the latest heavy rains, a volunteer youth group, Nafeer, provided a much higher estimate on Friday, saying that at least 14,517 houses and over 72,000 people were affected in four districts alone on the edge of Khartoum.

“Some families are still living in nearby schools and in harsh conditions; many areas are without electricity or means of transportation,” the group said.

Nafeer added that families in these areas had not access to clean water and the unsafe tank water they have been surviving on “is sold at double the regular price.”
