NEMA Orders Closure of Speke Resort Gardens, 3 Beaches over Flooding|24/05/2020|"Speke Resort Munyonyo gardens, Gaba, KK and Ddundu beaches have been ordered to close by the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) for encroaching on Lake Victoria boundaries.

NEMA ordered KCCA to close the beaches, saying they have set up illegal structures which have blocked the movement of water, leading to flooding after Lake Victoria water levels rose.

The directive by NEMA executive director Dr. Tom Okurut is contained in a letter dated April 24 to KCCA executive director Eng. Andrew Kitaka.

Dr Okurut said a NEMA assessment noted that the flooded sections were illegally reclaimed from the lake and put up structures without approval by the authorities.

He asked KCCA to declare all buildings in the flooded swathes of Speke Resort Munyonyo unusable by the public.

NEMA also asked KCCA to close markets at Gaba and Mulungu landing sites and the vendors be relocated by KCCA.

President Museveni on Sunday, April 19, ordered encroachers to vacate lakeshores and river banks before the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) catches up with them.

According to Mr Museveni, water levels in Lake Victoria have risen to 13.21 metres; this being the second-highest level since May 1964, when the lake went up to 13.41 metres.

“This water, we have the problem of encroachers, people who cultivate on the shores of the lake and banks of the river. Please get off those points. NEMA is coming to chase you off because you will bring us problems. With the rains, the levels have risen to 13.21m. This is the second-highest level since 1964 May, when the lake went up to 13.41,” Mr Museveni said on Sunday while updating the nation on government efforts in the fight against the spread of coronavirus."|https://chimpreports.com/nema-orders-closure-of-speke-resort-gardens-3-beaches-over-flooding/
