NGO, insurance, banks team up to help pastoralists survive devastating droughts|08/01/2018|"Orgo Bodo is a 40 year old member of the Hammer Tribe, a pastoralist community living in the South Omo Zone of the SNNP region. Like many in the Hammer community he raises cattle and goats to feed his family.

“Our community is not engaged in other farming activities we are pastoralists,” Orgo explained.

It is for this reason that climate change and a recent El Niño weather pattern affecting southern and eastern Ethiopia over the past couple of years has severely affected him.

Orgo and other Hammer community members have lost most of their animals due to the severe drought. Even though the South Omo area is arid and people were used to dry conditions, the weather has become so severe that, over the last two years, people living in the area like those in the Hammer tribe have suffered greatly, according to experts.

“The climate has changed in the past few years and it has affected the livelihoods of the people in the area. Rainfall has declined significantly, causing grassy areas to dry out,” Orgo told Capital.

Orgo said he lost all of his cattle and goats, which has devastated his family. “Before the drought I had 50 sheep and cows, others also lost their all their animals like I did and they had up to 1,000,” he said.

To combat this problem Orgo says he is now working with an alternative farming program under an association formed by community members to help fight the effects of drought on their daily lives.

“We have formed a 10 member association and started growing vegetables as an alternative source of income,” he said.

“There have been two harvests of onion, tomato and chili at Dimeka town at Hammer Wereda,’ he added.

Orgo was one of many invited participants from three regions, living the pastoralist life, who came to share best practices and learn from others at Farm Africa’s National Resilience Forum held from December 20 to 22 at Hawassa, SNNP.

The Farm Africa’s Market Approaches for Resilience project funded by Department for International Development (DFID) is being implemented in Ethiopia under the global Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters (BRACED) program in three regions.

The project that focuses on pastoralists in the Ethiopia Somali, SNNP and Afar regions. The goal is to show ways people can still survive when their former way of living is threatened by climate change.

The interventions show people how to mitigate the effects of climate change by creating access to financial insurance services, establishing and strengthening village saving and credit groups, natural resource management including participatory forest management, and climate information dissemination via media. The project has also designed programs in semi urban areas including technical support on expanding income sources and job creation and creating green spaces.

Negusu Aklilu, Chief of Party, BRACED/MAR, said that that the BRACED project of Farm Africa mainly focuses getting the business and private sectors to expand savings and credit and participatory natural resource protection to alleviate climate change in the three regions.

In the past three years the program has benefited 178,000 individuals, mostly pastoralists. The goal is for them to be able to generate their own income rather than rely on aid.

“We are helping them act on their own ideas to earn more money,” he added.

For instance they established a village saving and loan association with a group of individuals saving a small amount of money when they earn some and then providing that sum as a loan for other members to implement new projects. Currently Farm Africa’s BRACED MAR program has formed 329 projects. Besides the saving and credit association the groups has social funds to help out people in emergency situations.

“We believe that by creating strong social bonds that the community will be able to support themselves when the program ends,” Negusu said.

Besides village savings and loan associations BRACED has also facilitated the linkage of microfinance institutions in the three respective regions to provide loans for pastoralists. “We have provided loan guarantees for the microfinance institutions to commence their operation in rural pastoralist areas in addition to helping them establish branches in targeted areas,” he added.

So far over 4,680 households have benefited from the microfinance institutions. In collaboration with M Birr and Bell Cash mobile banking service has also commenced in the rural areas for the community to settle their loans with the micro finances and also to manage their savings without having to travel long distances to banks.

Since the program has gotten the private sector involved insurance companies have also helped out. They have instigated a program to provide insurance coverage for livestock. Like the mobile banking and credit scheme with microfinance institutions insurance coverage came as a result of a partnership with Nyala Insurance, one of the leading private insurers.

Farm Africa’s documents indicate that in addition to partnering with Nyala, Mercy Corps, a nongovernmental organization, and a consultancy firm Pula Advisers have also taken part in the pilot project. Insurance coverage is a big help when it comes to giving pastoralists a leg up in response to climate shocks.

Aklilu said that two types of insurance coverage have been delivered to micro insurance clients. Animal indemnity insurance is linked to microfinance. Solomon Zegeye, Manager of General and Micro Insurance at Nyala Insurance told Capital that under the public private partnership the insurance company is working with relevant institutions to cover the pastoralists affected by climate change. “Under the BRACED program we have provided coverage in SNNP, Afar and Somali regions,” Solomon added.

Indemnity based coverage which began at Arba Minch and Derashe Wereda to help protect against the loss of animals due to disease, theft, and accidents.

The distribution cost for the current operation is easily managed by an IT application. As a result the person does not need to travel to the insurance coverage area. This helps expand the insurance service in rural locations, an insurance company spokesperson said.

So far Nyala has settled claims for the loss of two cattle which has led to a more trusting relationship with local clients.

The other insurance coverage is asset protection for pastoralists which helps them get veterinary support veterinary for milking cows.

Solomon said that in 2007 Nyala began agricultural micro insurance as a pioneer for its micro insurance policy and now it has expanded its coverage.

Experts said that the role of Mercy Corps, who is one of the implementer of the project with Farm Africa, on the implementation of micro insurance that includes indemnity based livestock insurance is crucial. The contribution of Farm Africa in the three regions is helping change the lifestyle and expand economic resources of pastoralists like Orgo who otherwise would have been devastated by climate change.

Mohammed Beroele, a pastoralist from Chifra Wereda of Afar region who is currently involved in small scale farming, told Capital that Farm Africa is providing technical support and equipment. “They provide us seeds for vegetables and fruit as well as the equipment and support we need,” he said.

“About five years ago I began farming, I was growing corn,” he said.

Mohammed said that in the last year he expanded the activity by adding the variety of fruit and vegetables and a ranch for livestock.

“At first I was not saving like other people in my region but now I am able to feed my family and livestock,” he said

“I could start saving soon, he added.”

The latest metrological forecasts for the community predict more dry weather so more will need to be done to prepare. The program has set up to 25 metrological data collectors, which give reliable and specific climate information transmitted via radio that they follow via their village radio group.

“The collected climate information is analyzed so we can make recommendations for the pastoralists and agro- pastoralists and they can take action based on the latest metrological forecasts,” Nigusu said

Nigusu added that they are getting promising results on their activity in the regions and expect to continue their strategic support since they will get more funds from their partners."|https://www.capitalethiopia.com/feature/ngo-insurance-banks-team-help-pastoralists-survive-devastating-droughts/
UN warns of looming drought-related humanitarian crisis in Somalia|06/05/2019|"A senior United Nations official has cautioned that the harsh drought conditions currently afflicting much of Somalia are likely to trigger a major humanitarian crisis if urgent action is not taken to contain the situation.

The 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan, currently only is funded to 19 percent for the year, which is very worrying with the current extent of the humanitarian crisis that is evolving,” said Conway, who is also the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator.

During a visit, the DSRSG said the situation required strong advocacy with donor and financing partners to bring the humanitarian response up to scale, “so we don’t find ourselves in Somalia in a situation where people are moving increasingly into crisis and potentially over the edge into more disastrous conditions.”

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), drought conditions in the 2018/19 rainy season have led to an increase in the number of people designated as “food insecure” in Somalia since October of last year. OCHA warned that a deterioration into crisis conditions is expected in many pastoral and agro-pastoral areas during the month of May, due to funding shortfalls that may hamper a full implementation of the planned food assistance.

Conway was accompanied by Monika Agnete Pollan Thowsen, senior advisor on humanitarian affairs at the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Svein Olav Svoldal, first secretary at the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Nairobi, and Matija Kovac, the head of OCHA’s Humanitarian Financing Unit.

The day-long trip included a visit to temporary shelters in Baidoa to assess the living conditions of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and weigh up appropriate measures to alleviate their suffering.

The visiting delegation also held discussions on the unfolding humanitarian crisis with the President of South West State, Abdiaziz Hassan Mohamed “Laftagareen,” and representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who work with IDPs.

“Today we received a delegation that came to assess the humanitarian situation in South West, particularly in Baidoa. We discussed the pressing challenges – mainly the delayed rains, how to scale up humanitarian response, and how to mobilize resources to tackle the drought affecting our people,” President Laftagareen said.

Last year, a drought spanning four consecutive below average rainy seasons left about 6.2 million people in need of emergency aid such as food, water and shelter. That prompted the UN to launch an aid appeal of $1.6 billion to help address the crisis.

To prevent the situation from worsening, the Norwegian government is already supporting a number of projects in Baidoa and planning to boost humanitarian support in South West State in conjunction with the UN.

“We are on a monitoring mission to Baidoa together with the UN and the Somalia Humanitarian Fund. We have a partnership with the Norwegian Refugee Council and we support Save The Children. We were able to interact with IDP communities and learned the current challenges faced by the growing IDP population,” observed Thowsen.

Noorta Abdi Osman was displaced by the drought from the settlement of Hawaal Barbaar, which is situated 30 kilometres outside of Baidoa. She lamented the shortage of water and the mounting humanitarian needs at the Hawlwadaag camp where she is now living.

“Our challenges have doubled since coming here – shortage of water, no food to eat, and no end in sight to the drought. We seek assistance from the international community and the South West administration,” Ms. Osman said.

Fadumo Ali Mohamed, a 45-year-old mother who was also displaced by the prolonged drought in the Bakool region of the state, thanked the donors for constructing a borehole in the Hanaano camp because the project has helped alleviate their plight.

The delegation also visited a school project at the Hawlwadaag camp to witness the efforts being made by local NGOs to educate children uprooted by the ongoing drought."|https://www.capitalethiopia.com/capital/un-warns-of-looming-drought-related-humanitarian-crisis-in-somalia/
FOREX drought strangles local suppliers|18/06/2018|"Companies ask government for amnesty to fulfill contracts



Local companies are struggling to supply materials needed for government mega projects within the required time period.

Companies Capital spoke with say lack of hard currency has prevented them from supplying construction materials for the projects. People working in the industry say this is another example of the hard currency crunch choking Ethiopia’s economy. Many manufacturers say they almost did not produce the entire year.

“Now buyers are going to confiscate or annul the performance and bid bonds because companies failed to deliver on time,” a manager for a construction equipment company who asked to be anonymous told Capital.

The project managers, particularly bureaus at the Addis Ababa City Administration, are now notifying the companies that they will annul the agreements and confiscate the performance bonds, which usually amount to ten percent of contract’s total value.

The construction equipment manager pointed out that legally, lack of foreign currency is not a legitimate excuse for failing to deliver a product like a natural catastrophe or war is. In Ethiopia’s commercial code a hard currency shortage is not considered a ‘Force Majeure’ or ‘Act of God’.

“It was not an issue during the period when the code was ratified but now it is the country’s major economic challenge. The government should incorporate the issue into the law or facilitate hard currency,” an expert said.

“We have insisted that public institutions help us obtain hard currency to produce the materials and extend the deadline, but they have not supported us; the agreement has not taken this into consideration,” a company owner claimed.

This issue was one of the major topics of discussion at the Metal Industry Development Institute’s (MIDI) latest meeting, as the steel sector is a major victim of the FOREX shortage.

Sources at the Association of Basic Metals and Engineering Industries told Capital that they have asked for help from the relevant government bodies and requested that public institutions consider the hard currency shortage to be a ‘force majeure’. “We have also recommended that they allow the contract to be fulfilled on an installment basis and allow factories to supply the product based on the amount of hard currency they have secured,” one of the industry actors said.

Sources said that the MIDI wrote a letter to the city administration asking them to consider the foreign currency shortage and not penalize local manufacturers since they are important to Ethiopia’s economy.

Manufacturing industry representatives reportedly believe that the only source of hard currency for the sector, which is mainly engaged in import substitution, is accessed from state banks, particularly from the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia. Private banks; they argue, provide hard currency to those they have a ‘special relationship’ with. They claim that even though the National Bank of Ethiopia has a directive forcing banks to prioritize manufacturing when approving hard currency the central bank has not been properly controlling the Letter of Credit approvals from private banks.

The hard currency shortage has affected the nation’s entire economic activity since the imbalance in earnings between hard currency and imports occurred. Many manufacturers have shut down or scaled back operations."|https://www.capitalethiopia.com/featured/forex-drought-strangles-local-suppliers/
Somali Region continues to be epicenter of drought, according to WFP|30/04/2018|"A recent report from the World Food Program shows that 7.88 million people in Ethiopia will require food assistance in 2018 and the Somali Region remains to be the epicenter of the drought, with an estimated 1.8 million people in need of lifesaving food assistance.

The update report states that there are an estimated 1.7 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Ethiopia, of which, an estimated 461,000 conflict induced IDPs are in the Somali Region.

Currently, the WFP is providing emergency relief assistance to the Somali Region while the government of Ethiopia and the joint Emergency Operation Program an NGO consortium provide relief assistance to the rest of the country.

According to the report, the 1.7 million IDPs in the Somalia Region was driven by factors ranging from conflict, environmental degradation, natural and manmade disasters, changing livelihood strategies in an evolving political economy, poverty, and progressive depletion of coping mechanisms available to the displaced and host communities.

It further states that below-average spring rains, combined with extremely low household livestock holdings, suggest the ongoing food security situation in south-eastern Ethiopia will continue through most of 2018. Sustained, large-scale assistance is needed to mitigate the risk of increases in acute malnutrition and a further deterioration of outcomes, particularly in the Somali Region.

Currently, WFP’s emergency relief assistance in the Somali Region comprises of a combination of food and cash based modalities, depending on system readiness, nutritional needs and where markets function. The report also states that the re-targeting and registration of beneficiaries that will receive cash and/or food transfers under the 2018 HDRP is ongoing.

According to the Humanitarian Disaster resilience Plan released in March by the Ethiopian government and humanitarian partners, most of the 2017 humanitarian needs are carried over into 2018 given insufficient recovery opportunities, compounded by the underperformance of the 2017 autumn rains; the prevalence of risk factors for communicable disease outbreaks such as AWD and measles; as well as large scale displacement due to drought and conflict.

The appeal seeks USD 1.66 billion to reach 7.88 million people with emergency food/cash and non-food assistance, mainly in the southern and south-eastern parts of the country. Due to many other humanitarian crisis around the world, meeting the needed funding will be a challenge, it has been said."|https://www.capitalethiopia.com/capital/somali-region-continues-epicenter-drought-according-wfp/
