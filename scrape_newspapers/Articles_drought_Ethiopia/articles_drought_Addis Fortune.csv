Drought Pushes Teff Prices to Record High|18/12/2013|"Early this month, Eshetu Lema, 48, was in Merkato, the largest open market in the capital. He was looking to buy teffin one of the specialized sections of the market, Ehil Berenda, where cereal crops are traded along with other agricultural commodities.

Eshetu, a construction worker and father of four, uses about 20Kg of teffeach month to feed his family, and he was carrying out his regular chore of buying the grain.

Teffis traditionally grown as a cereal crop. It is milled before it is fermented and then baked on large circular clay griddles to make a grey flatbread called injera. The cereal has been adopted by almost all Ethiopians as a staple food and is also used, albeit infrequently, to make porridge and traditional alcoholic brews like tela(beer) and katikala(liquor).

Eshetu used to spend around 400 Br to buy his monthly supply of teffbut was faced last month with something that he did not expect. He was confronted with having to pay 600 Br for the same quantity of grain he purchases monthly.

The price of a kilogram of teff, which had remained stable for around 20 Br a kilo for the last two years, has significantly increased in recent months.

“From time to time, the price of teffincreases, and it is difficult for me,” said Eshetu.

Eshetu claims that teffis his favourite food, not because he grew up consuming it, but because he has learned of its health benefits.

Ethiopia grows four types of teff: Liyu Magna(white teff), Melestegna,Abolseand Qey Teff (red teff).

Red teffis by far the cheapest and most popular variety consumed in the country, and it is considered to have higher iron content compared to the other varieties.

Different studies have shown that teff is a good source of fibres, iron, calcium and potassium; with high nutrition content, including 11pc protein, 80pc complex carbohydrates and 3pc fat.

Teffalso contains more lysine than barley, millet, wheat, rice and oats, according to EthnoMe, Harborview Medical Center’s ethnic medicine website."|https://addisfortune.news/drought-pushes-teff-prices-to-record-high/
