News: 4 500 drought-affected pastoral households in Somali region receive unconditional cash transfer|05/02/2020|"Cash transfer aimed at Enabling beneficiaries to meet their immediate needs and to kick-start productive activities

Addis Abeba, February 05/2020 – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has provided 4 500 drought-affected pastoral households in the Somali region with unconditional cash transfers to meet their immediate needs and invest in productive activities.

Each beneficiary household received 80 USD transfers between December 2019 and January 2020. Households with few animals, as well as those headed by women, and with children, the elderly, and disabled, and sick persons were prioritized. They were drawn from Daror, Deghabur, Yoale Woredas (districts).

“Ultimately, the cash transfers will help improve food security, restore livelihoods, and minimize the need to resort to negative coping mechanisms,” said Fatouma Seid, the FAO Representative in Ethiopia.

Implemented in collaboration with the Somali regional government, Save the Children and Somali Microfinance Institution, the cash transfer intervention is part of the “Early Action” that FAO launched in 2019 to safeguard the livelihoods of vulnerable pastoral and agro-pastoral communities.

Pastoral communities were affected by below-average Belg rainfall in 2019, compounded by the impact of consecutive droughts in the previous years, as well as conflict-induced internal displacements. These circumstances resulted in deteriorating animal body conditions, increased disease outbreaks, poor livestock market value, livestock death, and reduced milk yields.

Relief to cash-strapped communities

The cash transfers have enabled the beneficiaries to purchase the goods and services they need most.

Aisha Muhammed 60, who lost ten goats during the drought in 2019, was relieved to get the cash. “In December 2019, I purchased essential household items such as soap, sugar, and vaseline for my grandchildren. Now I am going to buy food. I will also buy two kids to boost my herd,” she said.

Amina Abdi 37, said, “Before I received the cash, we had run out of food and were having one meal per day on average. I closed my restaurant because I used all the capital to buy food. Now I have bought enough rice to last the lean period, and I am going to re-open my restaurant”, she said.

The “Early Action” is supporting 151 000 households in Afar, Oromia, Somali and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ regional states with livestock treatment services, supplementary animal feed and seed for food and forage production.

Analysis: Helping Ethiopian farmers adapt to drought and flooding|02/10/2019|"Addis Abeba, October 02/2019 – Nestled deep in Ethiopia’s highlands, in the Amhara region, Habru Woreda some 500 km from the country’s capital Addis Abeba, the small village of Berebeyu is grappling with the realities of climate change, with hundreds of its inhabitants reeling from land losses and poor harvests, or no harvests at all.

Berebeyu lies at the confluence of tributary rivers that flow from the adjacent mountain. The village is highly vulnerable to droughts, seasonal flooding, and mudslides. In 2011 a mudslide killed at least five people and forced dozens from their homes.

Small herds of roaming camels, donkeys, goats, sheep and cows trample through the village. Dead trees, gullies, bare soils and rocks exposed by flood waters are a typical sight in Berebeyu, which for generations has been home to a minority Muslim community of around 500 household.

The rapidly disappearing arable land and the trees scattered across the mountain face are a bittersweet reminder of what they have lost, and also a strong warning of what is to come.

A prolonged drought has seen many residents migrating abroad to seek alternative livelihood opportunities. Ironically, this is not always an effective coping strategy, as many are deported and forced to return to the same harsh environment that spurred their migration.

“It’s very difficult to live here; the drought is increasing in this area,” says 40-year-old Ahmed Shifare. He explains that many young men have fled to the Gulf countries, including his 16-year-old son. “For the older generation, even though the threats of drought are killing us, we have no other land to go to. Each household has at least one family member who has migrated to the Middle East; this is our way of coping with the drought,” he states.

Migration is a common adaptation strategy in Berebeyu. Older residents have long leaned on seasonal migration to complement farming. During the drought of 1984, many elders, including Shifare’s family sought employment in the city and, just like contemporary migrants they undertook all types of work, returning home to restart their farms after the drought. But Shifare says, “Following consecutive droughts in recent years, the scale of migration is nothing I have seen before; everyone is going without knowing if they will return.”

Yet, Berebeyu has demonstrated incredible resilience. Its residents have been living in the village for centuries overcoming many different challenges. But climate change and land degradation is proving to be more difficult than anything they have experienced before. Arable land has become a scarce resource. Each household is entitled to half a hectare for agricultural purposes, but demand has outstripped supply to the extent that even steep slopes are now being ploughed. The result has been an erosion of fertile soils which, combined with perennial droughts, has adversely affected crop production.

Eighty-year-old Sheik Yimam Shikuru, who lost his farm to erosion says, “All my children left me because my farm does not produce anything anymore — they went to look for better opportunities. It’s getting hot here, and when it rains, the water brings rocks and debris to my farm, killing all my crops.”

Shikuru has been living in Berebeyu for his whole life and the expression on his tired face clearly shows that he has seen better days. Four of Shikuru’s children migrated abroad to look for work, yet so far they have not been able to secure regular employment due to their inability to obtain work permits and are unable to help their father. Now older, more vulnerable and with no other livelihood opportunities, Shikuru is entirely dependent on his small, rocky and degraded farm.

While climate change is not the only push factor for migration out of the village, it acts as a ‘threat multiplier,’ worsening existing insecurities.

“I am landless, the land I am currently using is rented to me and it is very small. Now imagine what the drought will do?” says Ayalew Asifaw, a 33-year-old father. “If the land was big, I would grow a greater variety and quantity of crops — that way I could mitigate some losses, but with the size of my farm when the drought comes, what few crops I have are lost. If I get a chance today, I will leave because I will not sit and watch the drought destroy my family.”

Asifaw is no stranger to irregular migration. On three occasions he has sought to reach Saudi Arabia. He failed on the first two attempts, while during the third he managed to stay only for 18 days before being arrested by Saudi authorities and deported back to Ethiopia. It is now two years since he has been back in Berebeyu, but the prospect of staying permanently is fading. He has not ruled out the possibility of attempting to migrate a fourth time, despite the high cost involved and his increasing vulnerability upon each return.

Usmani Endris, a 29-year-old father of two, echoes the same frustrations, adding, “Land is limited here and this limited land is not productive because of climate change.” Endris is a migrant returnee; he worked in Saudi Arabia for a year prior to being deported in 2016. Since his return, he has twice sought to reach Saudi Arabia again through Bosaso in Somalia and Obock in Djibouti but was unsuccessful on both occasions.

The residents of Berebeyu are known to be positive and light-hearted people but concerns about their future survival in the face of climate change are increasingly dominating their conversations. But a seed of hope was planted in May 2019 when the International Organization for Migration (IOM), in collaboration with a local implementing partner Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekanysus Development and Social Service Commission, joined hands with the community to launch a project that is seeking to stem the tide of environmental degradation. The project aims to rehabilitate the environment while supporting the reintegration of migrant returnees by reducing land degradation in selected watershed areas through afforestation and the integration of fruit tree cultivation to support livelihoods.

The project is taking place under the European Union(EU)-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration (the Joint Initiative) which facilitates safe, orderly, regular and responsible migration management through the development of rights-based and development-focused procedures and processes on protection and sustainable reintegration. The Joint Initiative, backed by the EU Trust Fund, has been set up in close cooperation with 26 African States.

Through the project, community members along with returnees will develop 50 hectares, which they will use to harvest rainwater and trap silt sediments; which in turn will improve soil fertility. Trees and grasses will be planted to restore lost vegetation cover. It is envisaged that community members and returnees will generate income from the sale of seedlings. In four years, it is expected that they will start selling the fruits. In addition, over 240 community members will participate in ‘community conversations’ on topics related to migration and land degradation.

To mitigate the effects of drought, water conservation facilities will be constructed to harvest rainwater at the foot of the mountain overlooking the village, where water usually races down. Instead of the water wasted as runoff, it will be collected, stored and used for watering the nursery and crops, especially during the dry season. Trapping the runoff will further reduce the risk of flooding and land degradation.

Speaking during a recent focus group meeting, the villagers expressed excitement, especially the prospect of beating drought and earning an income from selling fruits.

Abdu Hassen, a resident, said, “We know what to do with the land, we are experienced farmers but without water, we cannot do anything. All we need is water and land to cultivate, and if the degraded land can be useful again, that will bring joy to this village.”

Another hopeful resident, Hassen Mohamed lauded the project saying, “This is one step to defeating climate change.”

News: Drought-hit Borana Pastoralists receive insurance payout|11/09/2019|"Addis Standard staffs

Borana/Oromia, September 11/2019 – A livestock insurance product aimed at protecting pastoralists against calamity from drought made a payout to close to 3,000 Borana pastoralists following the extremely poor rains this year. Referred to as the Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI), it is an innovative financial solution spearheaded by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) with a commercial partner, Oromia Insurance SC (OIC),.

This year, the main March – June rainy season, locally called Ganna, and is responsible for an average of 60 percent of the annual rainfall in Borana, fell short, resulting in limited pasture regeneration and perceptible decline in milk production and live weight of animals. This in turn has negatively impacted the well-being of pastoralists, who rely on livestock for their daily subsistence. According to USAID, much of the pastoral regions of Somali and Southern Oromia are experiencing the second major drought since 2017, which has caused severe water shortages, catastrophic livestock losses, and humanitarian crises. And, solutions like livestock insurance will add to the efforts made by development partners through availing cash to purchase feed, water and medicine for animals during stressful seasons – but before pastorlalists experience any loss of animals.

IBLI was piloted in Borana pastoral zone in 2012, and operates based on the assumption that a significant risk in the area is rainfall variability – across seasons and places. According to Yihenew Zewdie (PhD), Program and Partnerships Manager at ILRI, IBLI uses a satellite-based forage monitoring platform to inform the timing and extent of insurance payouts to individual pastoralist policy holders before the underlying ‘risk’ – drought – happens. Insurance payment is effected when the estimated forage condition in an area fall below an agreed and pre-determined level of triggering threshold. This makes the insurance product unique as it avails resources to policy-holding pastoralists before drought strikes. The product is also referred to as Asset Protection Contract.

On September 10, 2019, the underwriter of the insurance product, OIC, paid ETB 4.88 million to its policyholders. One of the beneficiaries of the payout, Aiysha Golicha (pictured below), who had insured her 20 cattle and 5 camels, explains ‘livestock insurance protects pastoralists during catastrophe’. She further added that after insuring her livestock, she does not have to wait for support from others as she receives payout before the failure of the rain causes severe impact on the animals.

Melkachew Temesgen, Microinsurance Director at OIC, stresses that the product they are underwriting not only provides compensation ahead of drought but also forage condition announcement contributes to informing pastoralists’ decisions concerning preparations they have to make to mitigate the challenges of forage scarcity.

According to information received by Addis Standard Ethiopia’s Ministry of Agriculture, Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA), ILRI and other development partners are exploring options that would enable the consolidation and expansion of agricultural insurance in Ethiopia and thereby help overcome the critical operational and regulatory challenges facing the smallholder-focused agricultural insurance industry in the country.

News: Save the Children says helping Ethiopia as it faces the worst drought in 50 years|13/12/2017|"Samuel Bogale

Addis Abeba, December 13/2017 – With the drought and displacements happening en mass in the East African countries the last few years, Save the Children said its main support remained critical to the drought affected areas and refugee camps across the Ethiopia.

In his presentation on the works of Save the Children in the last five years, Roba Halake, Senior Humanitarian Manager for Save the Children in Ethiopia, said that Ethiopia was experiencing the worst drought recorded in 50 years, and the rainfall in 2015 was the lowest since recording began in the 1960s.

Currently 12.6 million people are in need of emergency food assistance, and 3.6 million children and pregnant women are severely malnourished. A further 1.4 million people are displaced due to shocks of droughts and critical need for food, water, shelter and some non-food items.

In 2017, Save the Children’s target response was 1.5 million drought affected people with 900,000 children within, but it succeeded to reach out to 998,000 people so far, 541,146 of whom children. Among the 998,000 people Save the Children reached , 400,438 were assisted in the Health and Nutrition interventions, whereas 5,145 were supported through the Child Protection program of Save the Children.

According a document presented by Save the Children on Monday December 11, with 852,721, Ethiopia is the second largest refugees and asylum seekers hosting country in Africa, of which more than half of them (494,578) are children. And of all the refugee children in Ethiopia, 47% of them have access to education; whereas the national average for education is more than 90%.

Save the Children has raised $134 million for emergency response since 2015.

Since it first opened its office in Ethiopia in 1965, Save the Children has 55 offices across the country, which will make Ethiopia the only country in the world where Save the Children opened these much number of offices.

After doing the humanitarian works for decades administered by seven member countries of Save the Children: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, UK and USA, they merged to come as a single organization in 2012. Until today, Save the Children’s main humanitarian programs remained in areas of Education, Health, Nutrition, Child Friendly Systems & Structures, Child Protection, Livelihood & Resilience, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH).

News: FAO provides immediate livestock protection assistance to drought-affected pastoral, agro-pastoral communities in Ethiopia|06/09/2019|"Cover Photo: “IFAD/WB supported Pastoral Community Development Program (PCDP III) – Human and Animal Health Post. *FAO Archives

Addis Abeba, September 06/2019 – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is providing immediate livestock protection assistance to drought-affected pastoral and agro-pastoral communities in Ethiopia.

While sending off a consignment of veterinary drugs from Addis Abeba to Oromia and Somali Regions, Dr. Alemayehu Mekonnen, the Chief Veterinary Officer from the Ministry of Agriculture thanked FAO for the intervention. He said the Organization has historically played a key role in responding to livestock emergencies and diseases, including the eradication of Rinderpest in Ethiopia.

“These veterinary drugs and animal feed will reduce the negative effects of drought on the pastoral and agro pastoral livelihoods,” he said.

The “Emergency Livestock Response to Drought Affected Pastoral and Agro-Pastoral Communities in Afar, Oromia, Somali and SNNP Regions of Ethiopia”

Funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (UN CERF) and the European Commission for Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), FAO is providing livestock treatment and facilitating households to sell livestock that is still in marketable condition to generate cash and reduce pressure on the limited available pasture. Additionally, the targeted households are being provided with livestock feed as well as cash to cater for other essential household needs. FAO is also raising awareness in the targeted regions, on the use of Livestock Emergency Guidelines and Standards (LEGS) – a set of international guidelines and standards for the design, implementation, and assessment of livestock interventions to assist people affected by humanitarian crises.

The FAO Representative in Ethiopia, Ms. Fatouma Seid explained that the interventions, targeting 151 000 households (more than 750 000 people) would contribute to restoring the deteriorating health and body conditions of the livestock and reduce mortality.

“Ultimately, the aim is to safeguard livelihoods of the targeted communities and accelerate their recovery from the effects of recurrent drought,” she said.The livestock sector in Ethiopia is one of the largest in Africa and contributes to 19 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and 15 percent of export earnings. The sector is a source of protein-rich foods (such as milk, meat, and eggs); income; manure, draught power; fuel; and leather. The sector supports the livelihoods of about 80 percent of rural people in Ethiopia.

However, the detrimental effects of climate variability are affecting the well-being of livestock, and their production and reproduction efficiency. Frequent drought and a decrease in rainfall are affecting forage production; water availability; rangeland vegetation patterns; and is heightening and reinforcing the susceptibility of livestock to diseases.

As a result, capacity of the affected households to cope has declined to the point where there is a growing threat to the survival of viable pastoral production systems.

News: EU provides additional €50 million in emergency funding to tackle drought in Horn of Africa|07/08/2019|"Funding from this aid package will support drought-affected communities in Somalia (€25 million), Ethiopia (€20 million), Kenya (€3 million) and Uganda (€2 million).

Addis Abeba, August 07/2019 – The European Commission said it was mobilizing a further €50 million in emergency humanitarian funding to help the people hit by drought in the Horn of Africa. “With many in the region relying on livestock herding and subsistence farming, the prolonged drought is having devastating consequences on food availability and livelihoods,” a statement issued by the bloc said. It added that today’s additional funding brings total EU humanitarian aid to the region to €366.5 million since 2018.

“The EU is stepping up its support for the people affected by a prolonged drought in the Horn of Africa. During my several visits to countries in the region, I have seen first hand how much climate extremes are affecting this part of Africa. Our funding will help extend humanitarian assistance in the affected areas, helping communities ward off the risk of famine,” said Christos Stylianides, Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management.

Funding from this aid package will support drought-affected communities in Somalia (€25 million), Ethiopia (€20 million), Kenya (€3 million) and Uganda (€2 million). It will go towards emergency food assistance and assistance to address immediate food needs; the provision of basic health services and the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children under five years of age, and in pregnant and breastfeeding mothers; improving water access for both human and livestock consumption; and protecting households’ livelihoods.

“In addition, EU aid will contribute to assisting humanitarian agencies in the region to pre-emptively scale up their actions in the hardest hit areas,” the statement further said.

A spell of drought, following two poor rain seasons in a row, has put almost 13 million people in need of emergency food assistance across the region. Over 4 million children are estimated to be acutely malnourished, in addition to around 3 million malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women.

Background

The 2019 spring rain season in the Horn of Africa was among the top three driest on record. The ongoing drought comes just one year after the end of a major drought in 2016-2017. Within such a short time span, neither households have had time to recover, nor pastures and livestock herds to regenerate. Most of the affected communities live in pastoral and agro-pastoral areas. Scarce rainfall means that families cannot sustain themselves with their agricultural and livestock activities. Food prices have already risen across the entire region, thus further reducing poor households’ access to basic food supplies.

Ethiopia Drought: The Worst is yet to come|06/06/2016|"Kalkidan Yibeltal & Tesfalem Waldyes

The Bulbula River, named after the name of the small town 193km south of Ethiopia within the Rift valley, is no more. The entire water from the river has dried out in the last two months and it now looks a bare river bank. What’s left of it is just a few wells in areas where the river used to flow, which are now the sole providers of water to the residents of the dusty town and their cattle.During the drive to the area, an unusual sand storm frequently covers the villages, making the journey look like it’s a journey through the Sahara desert.

Of the many rivers that flow through this area, administratively called Arsi Negele, in West Arsi zone, are rivers such as Gudo Gedamso, Awede Jitu, Awede, Lephis, and Huluka. Bulbula town residents say Bulbula River was the third or fourth largest. “Our lives depend on this river,” says Alamitu Shabiya, one of the estimated 200, 000 people who depend on the river. A mother of two, Alamitu was a maize farmer who used the river both for her cattle and household consumption.“I have seen this river flow low, but I have never seen it completely disappear”, Alemitu told Addis Standard. “It is like it never existed.” The rain that was forecasted by the Ethiopian Meteorology Agency to last for ten days during the second week of March showed up, but just a day and it was light shower. “Although we have lost the entire maize crop that we have planted in summer of last year, our cattle have survived so far. But if this dryness goes on, they will soon perish,” a worried Alemitu said.

Further down in DakaDallo Harangama village, the issue of water hasn’t affected Madina Qofaa, a mother of four and pregnant with her fifth child. Lake Langano is within a walking distance “of 20 minutes.” “I don’t have cattle to worry about. I had three but my husband had to sell them at a knock down price to buy us food.”

Madina and her husband, Qabatoo, had their entire maize crop collapse as far back in Sept-Oct. 2015. “It just turned brown and collapsed. We didn’t harvest a single maize,”Madina said. Her husband now shuttles between Negele and Shashemene towns working as day laborer. “Sometimes he comes home with 30 to 40 birr, but sometimes he comes empty handed and we all had to go to sleep without eating.” Recently, Madina pulled her 13 year old daughter out of school in Negele town because “she can’t walk for an hour while hungry.”

What makes the case for the families of both Alemitu and Madina different is that they are not suffering from the sever food shortage that already made the lives of 10.2 million Ethiopians (or more) unbearable; their living houses suggest they had a decent life; and their children look they are well looked after. But a maize crop that already failed, a dwindlingfood stock and no rain in the horizon, both familiesare acutely aware thattheir worst days are yet to come.

Barely the scratch

In late March 2016 the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) in Ethiopia, together with its humanitarian partners, launched a 90-day campaign to raise money to finance Ethiopia’s urgently neededfood aid. The campaign was intended to bridge the US$700 million gap between what is needed and what has so far been secured to aid millions of Ethiopians affected by the ongoing drought, induced by the worst El Nino in recorded history.

Dr. Johann Heffnick

“…As we hope for the best, we must also prepare for the worst”

Ever since early 2015, when the effects of the drought first began to be felt in parts of Ethiopia, successive crop failures and widespread livestock deaths have tripled humanitarian needs, according to UNOCHA.Yet out of the US$1.4 billion appeal made by donors and the government only aboutUS$760 million was so far contributed by the government in Ethiopia as well as the international community. It was the reason why Ahunna Eziakonwa-Onuchie, UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the country,kept pressing for “urgent and substantial investment in the humanitarian crisis response this year.”

Her message of urgency reverberates through all humanitarian agencies operating in the country. Jeremy Konyndyk, the director of USAID’s Office of the U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance team says he is “concerned both at the depth and scale of the need [and] the scale of the challenge.” Speaking to the press on 19th of March, Konyndyk stresses that, “this is the worst drought [the country has had to face] in 50 years” and labeled it a “disaster” if not a catastrophe, yet. “A disaster can be something that happens. It can be an earthquake, a typhoon or in this case [this] drought”.

Dr. Johann Heffnick, Head of the Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Department at the European Union Delegation to Ethiopia (ECHO), on his part explains that the drought has resulted in failure of two consecutive harvest seasons: the small Belg (March to May) and the main harvest season of Meher(November-December) 2015; has significantly reduced the general level of water, both for human and livestock; and caused a serious shortage of fodder for livestock. “We are waiting to see if the rain is going to come in this Belg season,” he says in an interview with this magazine. “But for most of the people [affected] we know it’s going to be a problem up until the end of the year.”

Heffnick alarms that the government and its humanitarian partners need to scale up their efforts in order to simultaneously achieve the speeding up of the amount of aid that is coming, as well as make sure that food, water and seeds are distributed to the people in need sooner rather than later. Thenecessary response is already underway, he argues,but admits the scale of the intensifying emergency needs surpasses the resources at hand.

Running against time

Owing to the severe shortage of rain throughout 2015, the loss of agricultural production in most of the affected areas was “massive” states Heffnick. “Some of those areas have lost from 50 to 90 per cent of their expected harvest. The lack of water is equally [austere]; wells have dried up, rivers have completely gone arid. This has led to a considerable number of livestock deaths. Hundreds of thousands of livestock have died in some impacted places,” he said.

Bulbula (used to be) River. What’s left of it is just a fews wells

According to a recent USAID assessment report, in the agro-pastoral and pastoral areas of Afar, a highly affected regional state in Easter Ethiopia, the drought has caused the death of approximately 105,000 cattle, more than 440,000 goats and sheep, nearly 15,000 camels, and an estimated 4,500 donkeys. Meanwhile an estimated 1.8 million livestock are facing acute food shortages – affecting at least 118,000 households. The assessment report also underscored that food security and access to safe drinking water across the region continue to deteriorate,generating increased reliance on relief food assistance.

Now, says Heffnick, “we are watching everyday whether or not there will be rain especially in the North Eastern and Eastern parts of the country coming in the Belg season of 2016.” The month of March, however, did not look good. “Some of the areas that need rain badly have so far not gotten any,” says Heffnick. “It might rain later; we hope it does. But it’s not a good beginning [for the season].”

Even though the Meher harvest in the second half of 2015 failed a great deal, whatever came out of it was helpful, Heffnick explains. But the coming four months, from April onwards, are going to see mounting challenges as there aren’t any leftovers from previous harvests. “It would give us a little bit of a breathing space in the middle of the year if something can be produced from the Belg rains in terms of food, but also if it can produce pasture.”

According to UNOCHA, as of the 23rd of March 82,520 households have received seeds for the Belg season, a figure making up just 41.6 per cent of the targeted 198,122 households. The deadline for Belg planting is usually the end of March while the deadline for the season’s requirement funding was December/January.

Nonetheless Konyndyk of USAID is “very confident” that this disaster will not become a catastrophe as “it is entirely possible to ensure that we do not see severe, catastrophic outcomes due to this drought,” yet, “we expect that the period over the summer will be the worst period, so there is a huge amount of preparation that we need to continue to do to be ready for that time.” He bases his faith on enhanced capacity and expertise in terms of humanitarian response observed over the past three decades. “Even though this drought will be more severe, we have far better capability to manage this kind of situation than we had 30 years ago.” However, “our success is not inevitable.”

Recognition, misrecognition

The Humanitarian Requirements Document (HDR) which outlines anticipated humanitarian needs and required funding levels in a given period of time and was last updated in December 2015 reported a projection of 10.2 million people. The figures include 6 million children in need of emergency food assistance for the year 2016. The document gave key priority to 435 000 children under the age of five with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and 1.7 million children, pregnant and lactating woman with Moderate to Acute Malnutrition (MAM) requiring specialized nutritional support. It also indicated that an estimated 5.8 million people will need water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in 2016, as well as 1.3 million children who will need assistance to be able to continue their education.

Nowin the wake of the deteriorating humanitarian conditions the government and humanitarian partners are discussing to revisethe HRD for the second half of 2016. The revisions include increasing the number of people estimated to experience Moderate to Acute Malnutrition (MAM) from 1.7 million to 2.2 million and adjusting the number of children younger than fivewho are expected to face Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) from 435,000 to 450,000, according to USAID. In addition, farmers requiring emergency seed support have increased from 2.2 million to 3.3 million. The government is also receiving ad hoc requests for food assistance to support drought-affected people who are not initially included in the HRD.

“I have seen this river flow low, but I have never seen it completely disappear” Alamitu Shabiyya

As part of the response to tackle the risk of communicable diseases in drought affected areas due to delayed and incomplete food assistance distributions, as well as limited access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, the government and its humanitarian partners have made plans to vaccinate 25 million children against measles in more than 500 drought-affected Woredas (districts), according to USAID.

However a source from a humanitarian agency points out that there has always been “different levels of recognition of [the magnitude of] crisis” between the government and the humanitarian agencies. This time, according to the source who wants to remain anonymous, the humanitarian agencies are pushing for the number of people in need as high as “20 million, together with the chronically vulnerable people under the government’s safety net program.” A discrepancy between the government and the aid agencies on the severity of the situation is also seen while the latest HRD is being debated. “Even within the government, the experts and the technicians fully comprehend the gravity of the problem,” asserts our source. “But these debates are as much with politicians as they are with experts.”

For Heffnick of ECHO, though, the response to the drought from the government has so far been nothing but commendable. “We cannot say the response was bad or slow compared to the historic responses of the 1984/5, 1997/8 and 2003,” he says pointing to the fact that there has already been a US$280 million contribution from the government. “It has also issued a tender to buy one million tons of wheat. That’s unprecedented. But the challenges are enormous.”

That said, in the initial period of the alarm, it took the government some time to fully acknowledge the severity of the problem,creatingunnecessary delays to ring the alarm bells;the government initially claimed the country was readyto handle it on its own.But appeals soon followed as the number of the people in need skyrocketed. Nonetheless the authorities still resort to downplaying the severity of the crisis.

In January 2016, Mitiku Kassa, Head of the National Disaster Risk Management Commission confidently declared that there was enough supply of food for the people in need of food aid.Speaking to the state owned Ethiopian News Agency on March 27th, Mitiku repeated his statement and declared that there was enough stock of food and non-food items, and the government was distributingboth properly for all the people living in “parts of the country affected by the drought”. “There isno food shortage”, he said.

The worst is yet to come

Of the 790 urban and rural Woredas in the country 429 are affected by the drought, a number the government often refers to as “some.” According to Heffnick 186 of these Woredas are currently hotspot ‘Priority One’ districts, means they are areas that need urgent humanitarian assistance. Other 106 Woredas are in ‘Priority two’. Hotspot classifications consider the impact of food availability, WASH infrastructure, access to markets, the nutrition situation, and other contributing factors. Heffnick fears that “a break in the food pipeline might happen.” The country may have enough food at hand to distribute, but the road ahead is tough. “Things are going to get worse before they get better,” he admits. “And if the global community doesn’t respond [as quickly as possible], the next couple of months could be bleak in terms of aid supply.” Further complicating the problem is the fact that “even if we get the money today, it doesn’t mean the food will be in the hands of the needy tomorrow.”

In addition to significant funding gaps the challenge is further intensified by inadequate logistical capacity to efficiently manage the ever increasing relief commodity fleets and delivery. The system of relief aid distribution the country employs so far has been supporting an average of 3 to 4 million beneficiaries every year. It is now expected to meet the needs of triple that number, or most likely, more.

Several weather forecasts predict the current El Nino to recede slowly from July this year onwards, or so hopes Heffnick. If the Belg rains (March to May) do not arrive fast and sufficiently, the near future is going to be “glimmer than one would hope.” But if there is going to be yet another dry spell during the main rainy season of June to August, the problem would even be more severe. Konyndyk agrees. “The current projections are that the summer rains should be pretty good. If they’re not, that obviously will increase needs. If the Belg rains fail, that will increase needs.”

“We are cautiously optimistic about that not happening” Heffnicksays, “but as we hope for the best, we must also prepare for the worst.” For a country experiencing a drought the kind of which has not been seen in over 50 years, several things are hanging on so many ifs and maybes.

Bulbula River “is like it never existed”

Logistic nightmare

What is often neglected while discussing the current drought is the issue of logistics to reach out to those in dire need of food aid.In October 2015 the government in Ethiopia bought one million tons of wheat; another tender for the purchase of 500,000 tons was issued in March of this year.Imports are expected to increase to 2.5 million tons by September, according to the US Department of Agriculture. This surge in purchase is likely to further escalate the congestion at the Port of Djibouti, the entry point where more than 90 per cent of the nation’s imports come through.

Heffnick estimates that on average more than a month is necessary to unload aid carrying ships at the port. But a report from Save the Children released in February of this year estimates that the purchasing and transportation of food into the country through Port of Djibouti could take up to four months.

“We are also prioritizing logistics because it’s very difficult to take an architecture that is built to feed eight million people [who are alreadyin the Safety Net program] and add 10 million people on top of that,” Konyndyk of USAID said, adding “We’re looking at the viability of some different options because it would be helpful to take some of that congestion off of the Port of Djibouti.”

The congestion at Port of Djibouti necessitated a visit by high level government officialsin early March, including officials from the Ministry of Transport,and the Ethiopian Shipping and Logistics Services Enterprises.

On March 27 Capital, a private English weekly, claimed it has learned that at the onset of the year, aware of what was to come, Port officials from Djibouti informed Ethiopian authorities of the necessity to anticipate and prepare sufficient truck fleet to uplift all expected bulk vessels.

Workneh Gebeyehu, Minister of the Ministry of Transport, said that currently up to 780 trucks per day were carrying cargo from the port and the government has planned to increase the number of trucks to 1140 per day. The problem, according to Workneh, is the country lacks sufficient amount of trucks. “We have [a total of] 9,000 trucks assigned to the port cargo, but we need up to 13,000 trucks to accelerate the fleet.”

Madina and her husband had their entire maize crop collapsed as far back in Sept-Oct. 2015

On March 24, citing information on the port’s website and its ship-tracking data, Bloomberg reported that “At least 10 vessels” were waiting to unload “about 450,000 metric tons of wheat… one carrying 50,000 tons of wheat and sorghum is berthed.”

The overload at the Port of Djibouti “heightened by a quadrupling of the food aid than last year,” is only the first problem when it comes to logistics according to Heffnick. The transportation of the food and nutritional products to various hubs inside the country is another mammoth challenge by itself. “And then you have to transport the aid from these hubs to the Woredas and Kebeles (smaller districts) in need,” he explains. “In order for this [to happen smoothly] we need not only a lot of trucks but also efficient organization.” As water shortages are rampant in drought affected areas, water trucking system should also be enhanced, Heffnick contends.

Using “all means at our disposal” is essential and to that end engaging the private sector is one option, according to Heffnick. “We are seeing examples of that in water trucking,” he says referring to UNICEF’srecent successful contract with a private transport company to deploy additional 100 trucks to help reduce the water supply gap.This helpedaid agencies to reach some 350,000 people. But considering the fact that the people receive only 5 liters of water per person per day, “we cannot even remotely say this is enough.”

Another direction the government could possibly take in order to narrow the trucking gap, both for food, nutrients as well as water, is to engage the army, Heffnick suggests. “That could help alleviate the problem.”

In addition to being hit by one of the worst droughts in over 50 years, the country has experienced civil unrests in several parts particularly in Oromiya regional state, the largest of the nine states, during the past six months. As the drought and the unrest collide in some parts like the West Arsi and East Hararghe Zones, the distribution of aid has been obstructed, acknowledges Heffnick, creating another logistic hiccup for aid agencies.

Slipping downwards

Jeremy Konyndyk of the USAID emphasizes the importance of building “a series firewalls”, protections that can be placed to prevent people from slipping into the next level of vulnerability. “By the time someone becomes severely malnourished, a lot of those protections have failed,” he says. Protecting people from reaching that point of vulnerability should be a priority.

However as Ethiopia’s rain dependent, largely backward, agriculture is seriously challenged by successive rain shortages the number of people slipping downwards is certain to surge.

Back in Daka Dallo Harangama village, Madina waits for her husband Qabatoo to come with some money and “some bread for the children.” A farmer only a year ago, his life and the lives of his family now depends on what he earns as a city laborer. “Sometimes, he fails to come home because he has had bad luck getting money and doesn’t want to come to home empty handed,” said his expectant wife. “With every passing day, I am seeing my family slipping into absolute destitution.”

#EthiopiaDrought: tenfold increase in children with malnutrition in Doolo zone, 67 died in June alone: MSF|26/06/2017|"Addis Abeba, June 26/2017 – An acute humanitarian emergency is unfolding in Doolo zone, in Ethiopia’s Somali region, as malnutrition reaches alarming levels, warns Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), whose teams are working in Doolo zone, the worst affected area.

“The numbers of young children with severe acute malnutrition in Doolo zone are the highest ever seen in this area by our teams in the 10 years we have worked in the region,” says Saskia van der Kam, MSF nutritional advisor.

MSF teams, working alongside Ethiopian health authorities, have set up 27 outpatient therapeutic feeding centres and four inpatient therapeutic feeding centres to treat children with severe malnutrition.

In Danod, Lehel-Yucub, Wardher, Galadi and Daratole, MSF teams have treated 6,136 children under five for severe acute malnutrition since January. This is over 10 times more than in the same period of 2016, when 491 children received treatment for the life-threatening condition.

In the first two weeks of June alone, 322 severely malnourished children were admitted in the four inpatient feeding centres supported by MSF. Despite all medical efforts, 51 of these children did not survive. The total number in June has risen to 67 children.

“The deaths of these 67 children show the gravity of the situation,” says van der Kam. “What we are seeing is a humanitarian emergency.”

Thousands of people are fully dependent on external aid

The malnutrition crisis comes in the wake of two failed rainy seasons. Many people have seen their livestock die as a result of the drought, which has forced them to abandon their traditional nomadic way of life. They have settled in informal camps, where they do not have enough food and safe water to survive.

“When the drought came, our animals died so we could no longer stay in the bush,” says Fardausa, who has brought her three-year-old granddaughter, Maida, for treatment to one of the therapeutic feeding centers supported by MSF.

“I have never seen a situation like this. We had animals that gave us everything we needed. Now we have nothing and our children become sick and die.”

Droughts are nothing new for people in this area. The mainly-pastoralist population knows how to adapt so as to lose as few camels and cows as possible until the next rains come. But after two failed rainy seasons in a row, many can no longer cope and are now totally dependent on external aid.

“Our teams are seeing entire communities left without milk, as most of their animals have died,” says Karline Kleijer, head of MSF’s Emergency Support Desk.

“Without their animals, they no longer have a source of income or the means of transporting food and water when on the move. People are knocking on our doors begging for food.”

Malnutrition soars as food aid runs short

People in the camps have been receiving food aid and the regional government has been providing 2 to 3 cooked meals to people in most of the informal camps. However, supplies of food are insufficient for the high number of displaced people in need and are now running out.

“In the last week of May, the distribution of cooked food was halted, and the monthly distribution of dry food rations was delayed, leaving large numbers of people without any food at all,” says Kleijer.

“More concerning, the World Food Program has warned that its supply of emergency food aid for the Somali region will run out at the end of July, leaving 1.7 million people even more vulnerable to malnutrition,” says van der Kam.

MSF urges donors and other organizations to scale up their support to the Somali region

Fearing a stark deterioration of the nutrition and humanitarian situation in the Somali region, MSF is planning to expand its emergency response to other zones, including Jarar and Nogob zones.

“Our teams are working with the health authorities to reach as many children as possible to provide them with therapeutic food so as to reduce the immediate mortality, rather than providing comprehensive care to a smaller number of children,” says Kleijer.

“But we shouldn’t have to make such a choice. More food aid and more humanitarian organizations need to arrive in this region urgently.”

MSF calls on donors to step up their support to Ethiopia to ensure that a continuous supply of food reaches the people who need it. In conjunction, humanitarian organizations need to send teams and supplies to the hardest-hit areas to prevent the crisis from escalating further.

News: UN food agency chiefs on visit to drought-hit Ethiopia warn hunger crises will escalate unless more is invested|05/09/2017|"Addis Ababa, 5 September 2017 – Speaking at the conclusion of a four-day visit to Ethiopia, including to the drought-stricken Somali region, the heads of the United Nations food agencies made a joint call for greater investment in long-term activities that strengthen people’s resilience to drought and the impacts of climate shocks.

José Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and David Beasley, Executive Director of the World Food Program (WFP), made their plea after they visited projects that treat dwindling herds to limit further livestock deaths and met drought-affected people receiving food rations.

“This drought has been going on for a long time and we have lost much of our livestock,” Hajiji Abdi, a community elder told them. “If we didn’t get food assistance, we would be in big trouble – but this is still not enough to feed us all.”

Back-to-back droughts have left at least 8.5 million people in Ethiopia in need of food aid. In the Somali region, rains have failed for the third consecutive year. The death of many livestock has caused a breakdown in pastoral livelihoods, contributing to soaring hunger levels and alarming increases in malnutrition rates. While the emergency response led by the Government has begun to stabilize the situation, additional resources are still urgently needed to prevent any further deterioration.

“It is essential to invest in preparedness and provide farmers and rural communities with knowledge and tools to safeguard themselves and their livelihoods. We’ve witnessed here that saving livelihoods means saving lives – it is people’s best defense against drought,” said Graziano da Silva, Director-General of FAO, the organization that is providing emergency livelihood support for drought-affected livestock owners and farmers, as well as support to stabilize communities’ long-term resilience.

“A drought does not need to become an emergency,” said Houngbo, President of IFAD, the agency that provides the government with loans, grants and technical expertise for rural development projects. “We know what works. In the Somali region, where there is investment in irrigation systems, water points, rural financial institutions, health and veterinary services and other long-term development projects, the communities can better sustain themselves and their livestock through this devastating drought. This is what we need to build on.”

“We have seen clearly here that working together the three UN food agencies can achieve much more than alone,” said Beasley, head of WFP, which is providing life-saving assistance to 3.3 million people in the Somali region, the epicenter of three years of drought.

“Of course we already collaborate, but now we will take these models and replicate them and scale them up across the world. We need to save lives while investing to support sustainable, resilient environment for communities across the globe so they prosper and succeed,” he added.

The impact of long-term development projects undertaken by the three food agencies was evident in the Tigray region, where agency heads saw irrigation schemes, fruit nurseries and health centers that are boosting productivity, increasing incomes and improving nutrition so that rural people can better withstand external shocks like droughts.

All three agencies are working closely with the Government of Ethiopia to eliminate hunger in the country. In meetings with Deputy Prime Minister, Demeke Mekonnen, and other high-level government representatives they discussed the need for greater collaboration and investment in resilience.

Donors launch campaign to address funding gaps in Ethiopia drought response|23/03/2016|"Humanitarian partners in Ethiopia today launched a 90-day campaign to raise awareness on the urgent need for an additional funding for the drought crisis in Ethiopia to address the humanitarian resource gap.

“Ethiopia is currently contending with one of the most serious climatic shocks in recorded history with ten million people facing lost harvests and livestock as well as severe water shortages and health risks,” said Ms. Ahunna Eziakonwa-Onuchie, UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Ethiopia. “We are launching this campaign to advocate for increased funding commensurate with the scale and severity of this crisis.’

In a statement, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said while Ethiopia’s 2016 US$1.4 billion appeal has received over US$758 million from the Ethiopian government and the international community, significant life-saving gaps remain across all sectors. The four months lead time to get relief commodities to people in need means that action is required now.

“UN Humanitarian Coordinator noted that the government is one of the largest financial contributors to the crisis so far and also leads in the coordination of a complex inter-sector response, which uses government systems and relies on national capacity.”

Mitiku Kassa, Commissioner, National Disaster Risk Management Commission, on his part said, “We are indeed thankful and encouraged by the donors who have stepped up to support Ethiopia in this drought crisis,” adding “some of these donors joined the Government to respond at the onset of the crisis in October last year. They did so knowing that it costs three times more to treat severe malnutrition than to provide the food and other associated support that might have prevented that child’s descent into severe acute malnutrition.”

Noting that the international community stands to gain much from supporting Ethiopia in the drought response, the Humanitarian Coordinators observed that drought response is not just about saving lives it is about protecting development gains – gains which the Government and its development partners have worked tirelessly to build up over decades.

“The Government’s vision for development, enshrined in the second Growth and Transformation Plan, promises to steer Ethiopia further down its already remarkable path of progress,” said Ms. Eziakonwa-Onuchie. “We need to rally urgently to protect the development gains of Ethiopia over the past decade and ensure the country remains on its remarkable development trajectory. Urgent and substantial investment in the humanitarian crisis response this year is the only way to ensure this and we must act now.”

Editorial: Ethiopia drought a national disaster; it needs to be treated as such!|06/06/2016|"The first signs of a looming drought in Ethiopia began surfacing as far back as early 2015, when it became clear that a significant part of the country has experienced inadequate (and erratic) pattern of rain, the country’s main source of agriculture.

In August 2015, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) issued a statement that unambiguously signaled the disaster that was waiting to happen. “Food insecurity is widespread and rates of acute malnutrition are growing now above the international threshold that define an emergency,” the statement declared. (UNOCHA first signaled the alarm in February).

What triggered the first alarm was a below average rain the country received during the Belg season. But it was enough to significantly affect the season’s agricultural production and dry up scarce water resources in areas where rain water is the only source of life. As the latest El Nino, the hardest in recorded history, continued wreaking havoc in Sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia became its worst victim when it failed to receive, yet again, adequate rain during the main rainy season of June-September 2015.

Needless to say, humanitarian agencies, including UNOCHA, have been warning about the extended impact of El Niño into 2016. “The season is expected to be below normal, despite improvements in rainfall performance since end-July, as per the characterization of El Niño”, UNOCHA said in its statement. “A reduced Meher harvest following a failed Belg season will compound the dire food security in vulnerable areas.”

In August of the same year, the number of people in need of food aid was reported to be 4.6 million, a figure that jumped to 10.2 in December (see story here). But it was not the number of hungry people that kept growing; approximately 105,000 cattle, more than 440,000 goats and sheep, nearly 15,000 camels, and an estimated 4,500 donkeys have so far perished in the agro-pastoral and pastoral areas of Afar, in eastern Ethiopia and one of the worst affected areas.

Now, a discussion between the government and its humanitarian partners is underway to revise the number of people in need of food aid, which could simply see the figure jump to double the existing 10.2 million. By any standard, this is nothing short of a national disaster.

Not Ethiopia

Of all the countries in the world, Ethiopia, replete with its own history of drought and famine, should have been the last country to contemplate just what these first signals entail. Alas, the drought has become one of the many national agendas where the ruling EPRDF’s nature of secrecy, inconsistency and disharmony takes precedence.

At the helm of this is the National Disaster Risk Management Commission office. As early as Sep. 2015 an official from the office told the media that “the government has enough food stock and it is assisting farmers to continue their farming practices.” The head of the office, Mitiku Kasa, claimed the situation would not get out of control. He insisted the government was distributing early-maturing and drought-resistant crops in most of the affected areas. Mitiku repeated the same statement in mid March this year when he told a state affiliated media outlets that the government has enough supply of food to feed all the hungry people. However, his statement followed another statement by Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn who asked the world to help Ethiopia cope with the worst drought in its history.

All the same, independent media is tangled in a web of bureaucratic bottlenecks (and perhaps a systematic censorship) to freely report on the scale of what humanitarian agencies, often extremely cautious with the use of terms, are now referring to as a “disaster”.

There is no denial that the news of the drought and its devastating impact is on a collision course with the narrative the incumbent has relentlessly cultivated for the last decade or so: with a soaring GDP, much of it supposedly from the same rain fed agriculture that is now under threat, Ethiopia is the fastest growing economy and (miraculously) will continue to grow.

But for anyone, other than the government itself, there is no illusion that with the inadequate rain registered in the month of March this year, (the third consecutive major shortage of rainfall) Ethiopia is poised to see the worst of the drought.

Treat it like it is!

In 2011, when the recent last drought affected the entire Horn of Africa and threatened the lives of more than 11.5 million people mainly in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, Ethiopia was at the driving seat to mobilize international support that resulted, among others, in the pledging conference by the African Union. It not only organized a pledging conference but declared 15th of August 2011 a “One African Voice Call Day.” The pledging conference and its results were not without shortfalls, but thanks to due acknowledgements by the countries affected, including Ethiopia, they were able to mitigate the drought before it plunged the region into a major catastrophe zone.

The current drought in Ethiopia, on the other hand, has affected nearly the same number of people as the Horn of Africa drought in 2011. Worse, the number is expected to show a dramatic increase once the latest humanitarian requirement document, a document jointly prepared by the government and its humanitarian partners, sees the light of the day. And yet, the government decided to remain silent, worse still, it kept on sending mixed and confusing signals regarding the real state and magnitude of the drought. It also intimidates its humanitarian partners not to speak freely and often accuses them of exaggerating the situation. And although geographically more than a third of the country is affected by the drought and possibly nearly a fifth of the country’s population is threatened by it, the government kept on describing it as a drought that affected “some areas” and “some people.”

So far, only half of what’s needed (a staggering 1.4 billion dollars) is secured, and no one heard of initiatives such as donors’ pledging conferences. It is perhaps with this in mind that in the first week of March, humanitarian agencies in Ethiopia launched a 90-day campaign to “raise awareness on the urgent need for an additional funding for the drought crisis in Ethiopia to address the humanitarian resource gap.”

It is an awareness campaign that faces a stiff competition for resources in the face of the unprecedented refugee crisis in Europe, a continent home to most of Ethiopia’s traditional humanitarian partners. But it helps greatly if the government in Ethiopia stops worrying too much about de-servicing its self constructed image and start treating the drought like it needs to be treated – a national disaster – and activates the code red!

Five months after this magazine wrote an editorial pleading with the government to depoliticize hunger we will once again close this editorial with the same sentence we used back in October. “…it is time the country’s policy makers depoliticize hunger as detractor of their image and start treating it for what it is; a country’s image is nothing without its peoples’ lives.”"|https://addisstandard.com/editorial-ethiopia-drought-national-disaster-needs-treated/
EU boosts aid to Ethiopia amid worsening drought|08/04/2016|"The European Commission announces €122.5 million to help Ethiopia deal with a deteriorating humanitarian situation caused by the El Niño extreme weather phenomenon

Today the European Commission has announced €122.5 million for Ethiopia to address the immediate needs of people affected by the worsening humanitarian situation caused by one of the most severe extreme El Niño weather phenomenon on record. This new support aims to combine a humanitarian response and early recovery assistance with initiatives that address the root causes of fragility and vulnerability, the EU delegation to Ethiopia said in a statement.

European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos Stylianides stated:”With over 10 million people currently struggling to find food, the humanitarian situation is very worrying. The EU is taking action; our new support will allow us to step up our efforts to help the most vulnerable in Ethiopia.”

European Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, Neven Mimica also said:”Our support aims at combining short-term lifesaving with strengthening Ethiopia’s resilience by addressing the root causes of fragility and vulnerability. We can build on the past successes of Ethiopia which has already stepped up its efforts to tackle the drought crisis.”

Commissioners Mimica and Stylianides are currently in Ethiopia in the framework of the College to College (C2C) conference taking place in Addis Abeba, where Commissioners from the European Union and the African Union are meeting.

Today Commissioners Mimica and Stylianides together with Vice-President responsible for the Euro and Social Dialogue, Valdis Dombrovskis and Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, Marianne Thyssen visited one of the worst hit areas in Ethiopia, Dire Dawa, to assess the humanitarian situation.

No ordinary year in Ethiopia; drought a ‘code red’|17/11/2015|"John Graham

We cannot turn our backs on Ethiopia – we must learn from the region’s history books

On the dusty plains outside Erer in Ethiopia’s east, the rotting carcasses of cows, goats, donkeys and camels bake under the hot African sun, fodder for hungry vultures and stealthy hyenas.

Until recently 40-year-old Jama and his family called these lands home, and had done for generations.

But about a month ago Jama, his wife, mother and their 10 children made the difficult choice to sell their possessions and abandon these lands and their pastoral life. They were forced out when all but 10 of their 450 goats and cattle died from the drought.

Now they live in a small shack in one of the newly-minted informal settlements in town and rely on support from the government and Save the Children to survive.

“This is the worst drought in my life, my father’s life, even my grandfather’s life,” Jama said. “No one can remember anything like this before, we weren’t prepared for it.”

Livestock are the lifeblood of these arid low-lands, their milk providing a vital source of nutrition, while the animals themselves are a commodity for trade. Here wealth is defined by the number of cows and goats one owns rather than money.

So far this year, hundreds of thousands of livestock have perished from the drought in Ethiopia according to local government officials, with many more expected to die before year’s end.

Jama and his family couldn’t have seen this coming. At the beginning of 2015 rainfall forecasts showed a relatively normal year ahead. It was only in May after the smaller Belg rains failed that an El Nino weather pattern was declared, which is now predicted to be the strongest on record.

This failure of the Belg meant the planting season was limited, and when the typically strong Kiremt rains between July and September were poor too, in some areas for the first time since 1984, the alarm bells well and truly sounded.

As a result, the rate of severe malnutrition is increasing rapidly, particularly among children, with more than 350,000 children expecting to need life-saving therapeutic treatment this year alone.

By January the United Nations (UN) have predicted that 15 million Ethiopians will need food aid.

Such is the magnitude of this emergency, the Ethiopian government has revised up its emergency funding appeal from US$237m in August to US$600m to the end of 2015.

Time is running out to procure enough food to meet these needs, let alone actually putting hand in pocket and paying for it.

And this is before fully measuring the humanitarian impact of the poor Kiremt rains – the worst in 30 years for much of the Ethiopian highlands, which produce 90 percent of the nation’s crops.

In these fertile lands, which stretch north from just outside Addis Ababa and cover an area roughly the size of New Zealand, farmers are staring at empty fields instead of harvesting crops like teff, wheat, barley and sorghum.

Ethiopia’s global request for help couldn’t come at a worse time, as other large scale humanitarian crises unfold in places like Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Nepal and South Sudan. But we cannot turn our backs on Ethiopia – we must learn from the region’s history books.

You need only look back to the Horn of Africa drought in 2011, which affected 13 million people and saw more than 250,000 die from hunger in Somalia.

Back then the early warning signs began to emerge a full year before, yet the international community took till the peak of the crisis to act at scale.

But it was too late, much of the damage had been done.

In the years that followed this scandalous failure of the international system, a range of preventative measures were put in place to ensure history did not repeat, including the implementation of large-scale drought resilience programs and strong policy commitments from donor countries.

But here we are again. This drought is now forecast to be the strongest in Ethiopia in 30 years, yet funding commitments from international donors are worryingly low.

The Ethiopian government has responded resoundingly, unlocking US$192 million in funding and showing real leadership. They expect to be able to handle most of the impact of the emergency themselves.

Aid agencies are helping too. Save the Children is on the ground in 101 out of 142 of the worst-affected districts providing support including food, water, medicine and nutrition supplements for children suffering from malnutrition.

The international community must heed the warning and act urgently.

This is no ordinary year in Ethiopia; this is a ‘code red’ and it needs to be treated like one.

Sweden donates US$ 16 million to drought affected Ethiopia|20/11/2015|"The government of Sweden said it will contribute 140 million SEK (16 million USD) for food aid to people “affected by the severe and ongoing drought in Ethiopia”, Swedish Embassy in Addis Abeba said.



The contribution is made through a grant to the World Food Program (WFP). “Through this contribution more than 1.5 million people in the Somali region will receive cereals, pulses and vegetable oil, helping to stabilize malnutrition rates, which have risen sharply in recent months since the drought took hold,” a statement from the embassy reads, adding Sweden’s contribution will also complement food distributions in other regions following the Government of Ethiopia’s allocation of 4 billion birr (US$ 192 million) to relief efforts.

At the signing of the agreement on Wednesday the 18th November, Anneka Knutsson, Head of Sweden’s Development Cooperation stressed the importance to act early in these types of crisis. “Paying early will mean saving later.”



The WFP Representative and Country director, John Aylieff on his part stated that, Sweden was among the very first to step forward and respond to the current crisis. “Families across the Somali region, whose lives have been turned upside down by what is said to be the worst El Niño event in recorded history, will feed themselves and their children for the next month thanks to the generosity of Sweden”.



Ethiopia is facing the worst drought in decades that left 8.5 million of its citizens in need of emergency food assistance. Several estimates say the number may double to 15 million in the coming few months.

More Than 4.6 Million children in Ethiopia facing hunger from current drought|23/10/2015|"Close to five million children risk going hungry as the result of a worsening food crisis in Ethiopia brought on by a severe drought across normally green and productive regions – making this natural disaster the worst in recent history, warns Save the Children.

Three hundred and fifty thousand children are already severely malnourished, which if left untreated, can cause stunting, physical and mental delays in their development, or death.

This year’s drought, which has been caused by a particularly strong El Nino phenomenon, has directly affected more than 8.2 million Ethiopians across a huge area roughly the size of Texas, leaving them food insecure and dependent on food assistance from the government and international aid organizations. In addition, the enormous gains made in food security, education and health over the years risk being reversed as a result of this extreme climatic event.

John Graham, Save the Children’s Country Director in Ethiopia says: “The failure of the Belg rains earlier this year as well as the usually reliable Kiremt summer rains has had a devastating impact on Ethiopia’s harvest. Entire families have lost their incomes and food supplies, leaving the lives of millions, especially children, in the balance.”

The Ethiopian government has committed an unprecedented $192 million to combat the crisis as part of a huge national effort mobilized to mitigate the drought, but more support is urgently needed from donors and the international community to help the government stop the situation from worsening.

“The situation is going to get worse before it gets better. We now face the results of poor harvests across the country, and the next small harvest is not expected until June 2016,” adds Graham.

“The Ethiopian government is doing what it can to respond, diverting funds from road building and other projects – but international donors must also provide more relief now so that we can meet the needs of people affected by this incredibly serious drought – especially vulnerable children – before it’s too late.”

Save the Children is working in over 70% of the worst-affected districts, providing food, water, medicine and crucial support to families who have lost their incomes. The organization is also training community-based health workers to treat malnutrition, and supporting families that have lost their livestock and livelihoods with cash-for-work programs.

Drought in Ethiopia affecting millions, worsens food insecurity as government appeals for emergency food assistance|14/08/2015|"The less than usual drops of rain in the past several rainy seasons have caused drought in many parts of the country, particularly in Eastern and Southern Ethiopia, triggering severe food insecurity in communities already on constant food distribution list by donors. Estimated numbers of people affected by the current drought and are in need on emergency food assistance has doubled to 4.6 million.



But Ethiopia’s State Minister of Agriculture (MOA), Mitku Kassa, told government affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporation on Wednesday that early-maturing and drought-resistant crops are being supplied in most of the affected areas. While in the districts of Fentale, Amibara and Gewane in eastern Ethiopia distribution of animal feed is well underway, he added. IN addition Wondimu Filate, a spokesperson for the MOA, told the Associated Press news agency that, “the government has enough food stock and it is assisting farmers to continue their farming practices.”



However, MoA’s statements come late for the pastoralist areas of the Afar Regional State, in Eastern Ethiopia, where the deaths of cattle due to shortage of water and pastures in the current rainy season, Kiremt, has devastated many households and the country has, once again, issued an appeal for $325m (£167m) in food and other humanitarian assistance.

The Ethiopian National Metrological Agency’s (NMA) forecasts the shortage of the seasonal rains will improve in August. The NMA stated on Wednesday that it has established a national committee to assess the impact of the rain discrepancy.



But on the other hand a report from the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) expects an increase in the number of the food insecure people dependent on relief food assistance which was 2.9 million people beginning of the year. “Food insecurity is widespread and rates of acute malnutrition are growing now above the international thresholds that defines an emergency,” states the report.



The country has never experienced a rain deteriorating in two consecutive seasons since 1997. As a result, “this situation led to delays in planting not only the long cycle crops but now also the short cycle crops. In pastoral areas, thousands of livestock deaths have been reported,” adds the report. “Malnutrition rates amongst children under-five have increased significantly. Water sources are depleted and the regeneration of pasture has not happened. Unseasonal livestock and people migration out of the most affected areas and significant livestock deaths has been observed in many parts of the North East and Eastern parts of the country.”



“We are seeing sharp increases in humanitarian needs this year at the time when contributions from international donors have declined,” said US Ambassador Patricia M. Haslach said after visiting U.S.-funded humanitarian assistance activities in SNNP on August 13 and 14. “We must do more to ensure that the most vulnerable among us, and those affected humanitarian crises, have the resources they need to live their lives with dignity.”



According to a statement from the embassy, the Ambassador also visited a stabilization center in the Dega Birbir kebele of Mirab Abaya woreda, where children under age five receive treatment for medical complications resulting from severe malnutrition. “These children are at high risk of mortality and receive 24-hour care until their medical conditions have stabilized, usually five to seven days,” the statement said. The ambassador also visited an outpatient therapeutic program at the Laytirga Health Post, where mothers bring their malnourished children under age five for medical check-ups.



Climate shocks are common in Ethiopia and often lead to poor or failed harvests which result in high levels of acute food insecurity. According to data from the CIA fact book, approximately 44 percent of children under 5 years of age in Ethiopia are severely chronically malnourished, or stunted, and nearly 28 percent are underweight. Roughly 31.6 million people, or 32 percent of the country’s total population, are undernourished.



Famine Early Warning Systems Network’s (FEWS NET) food security outlook from June to December, predicts that poor families in Belg producing areas of Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region (SNNPR), northeastern Amhara, southern Tigray, and some areas in central and eastern Oromia to stay in Integrated Phase Classification (IPC Phase 3) from July to September due to delayed harvest and lean seasonal rain. Cumulative rain was as little as less than half of the 1981-to-2011 average in some places.

While below average rainfall is likely to continue for the rest of the rainy season through September, poor households in the pastoralist areas of Southern Afar and Northern Somali will stay in IPC Phase 3, maintains the outlook.



Things are expected to improve after October to December 2015 when there is a high chance that El Niño conditions will continue through March 2016 giving southern and southeastern parts of the country above average rainfall with a near normal timing of the start of the rains.

Drought likely in the Horn as famine threatens South Sudan and Somalia|16/06/2014|"Kalkidan Yibeltal

Greater part of the Horn is likely to experience a considerable moisture deficit, according to a recent climatic early warning report on rainfall irregularity issued by the Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture (GIEWS) of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

The report, which is based on satellite-derived observations, states that the 2014 rainy season has deviated from normal patterns since January: a typical rainfall occurred during the dry season as well as the rainy season saw above average rainfall in some areas and delayed onset in others. In the main agricultural areas of Kenya, Southern Ethiopia, Northern Tanzania and Somalia, a far below normal total culminated rainfall is expected leading the areas to a high risk of drought.

El Nino conditions are also indicated for the coming months, which should lead to above average rains between the months of October and March. Even though such conditions are favorable for planting new crops, they could potentially impede the harvesting of the main season cereal crops. They could even harmfully affect food and livestock conditions due to flooding caused by exceptionally heavy rain.

Another forecast released by the Greater Horn of Africa Climate Outlook Forum (GHACOF) on May 26 predicts an increased below average June to September rainfall in many areas in East Africa and an increased likelihood of flooding along the Nile and its tributaries in South Sudan and Sudan. Main season harvests in the later two countries and to a lesser extent in Ethiopia and Kenya could be negatively impacted if the forecast is realized. National estimations from Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia reach similar conclusions. Concurring with this, in Kenya, the Ministry of Agriculture is anticipating a significant decline in the production of Maize this year. While in Sudan, last year’s very poor cereal harvest added with prevailing high cereal price and a below average rainy season could have a tremendous impingement on food security.

The Northeastern highlands and Afar in Ethiopia, Western Djibouti and the “Greater Illemi Triangle” including Turkana, Karamoja, Southwestern Ethiopia and Southeastern South Sudan are among the concern areas identified by the report.

A meeting set by the African Union Commission Department of Political Affairs in conjunction with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) on the 14th of June 2014 emphasizes that in order to ensure the warnings are not realized as well as mitigation actions are identified and resourced in a timely manner so the humanitarian crisis of 2011 in the region is not repeated. Yet the lack of stability and enduring conflicts in South Sudan and Somalia are not helping the situation, posing a threat of famine says Dr. Aisha L. Abdullahi, Commissioner of the department.

In Somalia, successive seasons of near to above average rainfall and low food prices coupled with continued humanitarian intervention have brought down the number of people requiring urgent, life saving humanitarian assistance from its peak of four million during the 2011 famine. However since August 2013 findings indicate improvements have slowed down to a great extent. Between February 2014 and June 2014 an estimated 857 000 are believed to be in need of urgent humanitarian assistance according to a joint assessment by the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit for Somalia (FSNAU) and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET).

FEWS NET urges to immediately begin contingency planning particularly in areas at risk of flooding and in South Sudan where the food security impacts of the current forecast could manifest themselves most quickly.
