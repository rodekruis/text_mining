Ethiopia faces worst drought in decades|12/11/2015|The lack of rain has meant that crop yields in the worst-affected areas are down by 90 percent this year. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford reports from Eastern Ethiopia.|https://ecadforum.com/2015/11/12/ethiopia-faces-worst-drought-in-decades/
Ethiopian Drought Threatens Growth as Cattle Die, Crops Fail|08/10/2015|"(Bloomberg) – Saado Osman straps two bulging sacks of United Nations wheat to her donkey, one of the few animals the 70-year-old eastern Ethiopian herder has left since the rains stopped.

Like millions of others in the Horn of Africa nation she depended on that precipitation to provide fodder and water for her livestock. Now drought has killed 20 of her cattle and goats, leaving her family of 10 with just four animals.

“There is hunger here,” Saado said as she stood among a crowd receiving food relief in Afdem town in Ethiopia’s Somali region on Oct. 8. “For one year it has not rained.”

Rain failure from February to May this year in Ethiopia, one of Africa’s fastest growing economies, was compounded by a short and erratic primary wet season from June to September. That’s left 8.2 million people in need of emergency support, with the crisis set to worsen through September next year, according to the UN.

The effect may spread to the economy: agriculture accounts for 40 percent of output, employs almost 77 percent of Ethiopia’s 97 million people and receives significant government support, according to the World Bank.

Exacerbating the drought is El Nino, the periodic warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean in the area around the Equator. Ethiopia’s economy, which has averaged about 10 percent growth over the past decade, contracted by more than 3 percent in 2003, the last time El Nino occurred.

Ethiopia’s economy has diversified into services since then, and agriculture is less rain-dependent, meaning growth of about 10 percent is still achievable in the 12 months to July 7, said Abraham Tekeste, a junior finance minister. “It’s going to be a very challenging fiscal year,” he told reporters Thursday in the capital, Addis Ababa. “The El Nino effect is very clear.”

Ethiopia will spend 4 billion birr ($191 million) combating the drought this year and needs donor support, said Mitiku Kassa, who heads the government’s disaster response committee. There are plans to import 627,000 metric tons of wheat and 20,000 tons of edible oil, he said in an interview in Addis Ababa. In total, 15 million people may need food aid in 2015, and an extra $340 million is required for relief efforts this year, the UN said.

The number of children needing emergency treatment for malnutrition reached 43,000 in August, more than during any month in the last major Ethiopian humanitarian crisis in 2011, according to the UN.

“I think we have properly managed the disaster,” Mitiku said. “It’s not out of the control of the government and development partners.”

The area where Ayube Uso’s family lives in the east of Oromia region, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Afdem, at first appears untroubled. Their village abuts fields of sorghum and corn and a tarmac road. In between juts a near-complete Chinese-built railway to a port in neighboring Djibouti, a sign of economic progress.

Yet they’re struggling. Their crops are sparse, stunted and hold a few kernels, or nothing at all. Most years they grow enough to live on — this year, the harvest failed. Ayube, 65, can only recall two times it was this bad: during 2002’s El Nino and in the 1984 famine that prompted the Live Aid appeal. To help them get by, his wife gathers firewood to sell in a town three hours’ walk away.

The family also gets aid from a donor-funded government initiative that provides relief as payment for work on irrigation channels or hillside terracing. The 10-year-old project, which runs from January to June, will support 7.9 million Ethiopians next year.

‘Unprecedented’ Drought

Government measures to encourage agriculture include distributing seeds and fertilizer to smallholders and promoting commercial farms. One focus area is the Awash River basin, which supports three state-run sugar projects, cotton plantations and the country’s largest fruit farm.

In the Amibara district of Afar region, 200 farmers in Sa’adin Omar’s community have benefited from government help to irrigate 146 hectares of corn from the river, which is Ethiopia’s longest. Because of drought, only half the plot may produce crops, and the river level is so low that the hose from their water pump can’t reach it, the 45-year-old said in an interview.

On the village outskirts, among sandy soil and thorn-trees, the carcasses of dozens of cows lay scattered around. The price for the animals has crashed from 7,000 birr to as low as 1,500 birr as desperate herders saturate the market, Sa’adin said.

“There has never been a drought like this,” he said."|https://ecadforum.com/2015/10/16/ethiopian-drought-threatens-growth-as-cattle-die-crops-fail/
Ethiopia drought ‘as bad for children as Syria’s war’|18/01/2016|The UN says the worst drought in 30 years in Ethiopia means 400,000 children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition and more than 10 million people need food aid.|https://ecadforum.com/2016/01/18/ethiopia-drought-as-bad-for-children-as-syrias-war/
Floods cause deaths and block food aid in drought-hit Ethiopia|25/04/2016|"Flash floods in drought-stricken parts of Ethiopia have killed people and livestock and are blocking food aid deliveries to hungry communities, a charity said.

(Reuters) Ethiopians have been waiting for the spring rains to replenish water sources and to plant crops after the most severe drought in decades pushed more than 10 million people into hunger.

But many livestock, weakened by the drought, have died following heavy rains in Ethiopia’s remote Somali and Afar regions, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said on Sunday.

“Not only are families losing their remaining livestock, but the heavy rain is making the roads inaccessible,” said Mohamed Hassan, who heads NRC’s work in the Somali region.

“Roads are turning into raging rivers and trucks carrying food assistance are unable to reach many communities.

“If people don’t get aid I am afraid that human lives might be lost,” he said in a statement.

Some 28 people were killed by flash floods in early April, the majority when a river passing through Jijiga, the capital of Somali region, burst its banks, the government said.

The two eastern regions, among the worst hit by the drought, are mainly home to herding communities. Cattle, sheep and goats often die after floods because infectious diseases increase and vegetation becomes toxic.

The government and aid agencies are revising upwards a joint appeal in December for $1.4 billion as the number of districts suffering a humanitarian emergency has widened.

The crisis is expected to deepen until August when people hope to harvest crops they will plant in June to catch the summer rains.

Floods can also contaminate water sources, causing diseases like cholera.

Ethiopia regularly suffers hunger crises as eight out of ten people are farmers who depend upon the rains.

“We will see this situation again and again,” said Hassan. “We must not only hand out food, but also help people find alternative livelihoods.”"|https://ecadforum.com/2016/04/25/floods-cause-deaths-and-block-food-aid-in-drought-hit-ethiopia/
UN releases $17 million to drought affected Ethiopia|12/11/2015|"UN Emergency Fund releases $17 million to help communities affected by worst drought to hit Ethiopia in decades

(New York, 12 November 2015) – United Nations humanitarian chief Stephen O’Brien today released US$17 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support people affected by the worst drought in Ethiopia in decades. UN and partners are supporting the ongoing response led by the Government of Ethiopia.

The El Niño global climactic event has wreaked havoc on Ethiopia’s summer rains. This comes on the heels of failed spring rains, and has driven food insecurity, malnutrition and water shortages in affected areas of the country.

“A timely response to the emergency is critical. If we don’t act today, we face an even graver situation tomorrow, with more immense needs in 2016,” warned the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. “CERF funds will immediately provide crucial food supplies for people affected by the drought, now, when they need it most.”

The emergency funding will be provided to the World Food Programme so it can support some 1.37 million Ethiopians with food, and provide specialized nutritional supplements to 164,000 malnourished women and children.

The Government reports that 8.2 million people now require emergency food assistance, up from 2.9 million in early 2015. The number of people who need food assistance in East Africa is forecast to increase to over 22 million at the start of next year, including 15 million in Ethiopia.

By the end of the year, the UN’s global emergency fund will have provided over $80 million in response to humanitarian needs because of climate-related events linked to El Niño. Since July alone some $76 million has been disbursed to agencies to carry out essential aid activities in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Malawi, Myanmar, Somalia and Zimbabwe.

CERF pools donor contributions in a single fund so that money is available to start or continue urgent relief work anywhere in the world. Since its inception in 2006, 125 UN Member States and dozens of private-sector donors and regional Governments have contributed to the Fund. CERF has allocated more than $4 billion in support of humanitarian operations in 95 countries and territories."|https://ecadforum.com/2015/11/12/un-releases-17-million-to-drought-affected-ethiopia/
Deepening drought hits Ethiopia herders as millions go hungry|17/08/2017|"ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – Livestock are dying in parts of Ethiopia that are overwhelmingly reliant on their milk as deepening drought pushes up the number of districts in need of life-saving aid by 19 percent, according to a report released on Thursday.

At least 8.5 million people in 228 districts of Ethiopia need urgent food aid in the second half of the year, up from 5.6 million in January, according to the study published on ReliefWeb, a website run by the United Nations.

Ethiopia’s eastern Somali region is one of the country’s worst affected zones and is home to a quarter of the country’s cases of severe acute malnutrition, U.N. agencies said.

Severe acute malnutrition is a condition that kills up to half of sufferers under five years old.

“The number of districts requiring immediate, life-saving intervention increased to levels not seen since the height of the El Niño drought impacts in 2016,” said the joint report, which was compiled by the U.N. and the Ethiopian government.

Eastern and southern Africa were hit hard last year by drought exacerbated by El Niño – a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean – that wilted crops, slowed economic growth and drove food prices higher.

A strong aid response almost halved the number of Ethiopians needing food aid to 5.6 million since mid-2016. But the devastating drought was followed by poor spring rains this year in the southern and eastern parts of the country.

Since the end of last year, about 2 million animals have died in Somali region, which is home to many herding communities, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

“For livestock-dependent families, the animals can literally mean the difference between life and death, especially for children, pregnant and nursing women for whom milk is a crucial source of nutrition,” FAO said in a statement last week.

The U.N. agency is helping the worst hit communities to protect their remaining livestock with vaccinations, supplementary feed and water, and improved fodder production.

“It is crucial to provide this support between now and October – when rains are due – to begin the recovery process and prevent further losses of animals,” said Abdoul Karim Bah, FAO’s deputy representative in Ethiopia.

“If we don’t act now, hunger and malnutrition will only get worse among (herding) communities,” he said."|https://ecadforum.com/2017/08/17/deepening-drought-hits-ethiopia-herders-as-millions-go-hungry/
UN provides $18.5 million for early response to new drought in Ethiopia|21/02/2017|"UN’s global emergency fund provides $18.5 million for early response to new drought in Ethiopia

New York, 21 February 2017 – With the Horn of Africa facing one of the worst droughts in decades, more than 5.6 million people in Ethiopia alone are in desperate need of life’s basic necessities. To provide time-critical aid to more than 785,000 people suffering from hunger, malnutrition and severe water shortages in Ethiopia’s worst-hit Somali region, Emergency Relief Coordinator and Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Stephen O’Brien has released US$18.5 million from the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).

“I was recently in Ethiopia’s Somali Region, where I saw the devastating impact this drought is having on people’s lives, livestock and livelihoods. We must act today,” said Mr. O’Brien. “Time lost means lives lost so I am releasing CERF funding to provide urgent aid to people in need – now – when they need it most.”

The CERF funds will immediately provide affected people with access to water and health, nutritional and agricultural services. The funds will help pastoralist communities in the Somali region, who are most in need, and thousands of whom have been forced to move in search of water and pasture.

The current drought has hit Ethiopia before the country could recover from the effects of a devastating El Niño-induced drought in 2015 and 2016 which left more than 10 million people in urgent need of aid in 2016. While the Government and humanitarian partners implemented a remarkably effective response with generous donor support last year, millions of vulnerable Ethiopians are still facing prolonged drought.

“The CERF grant covers only a small portion of what is required in 2017 to address the rising hunger and malnutrition levels,” said Mr. O’Brien. “Humanitarians will use these funds to save lives, but it is a bridge that must be matched and surpassed urgently. Millions of people’s lives, livelihoods and wellbeing depend on continued donor support.”

Over the past two years, CERF has allocated a total of $47 million to aid operations in Ethiopia.

Around the globe, the ever-increasing scale and intensity of emergencies points to the need for a larger CERF to keep pace with the growing needs. To this end, the UN General Assembly in December 2016 endorsed former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s recommendation to double CERF’s annual target to $1 billion by 2018. Member States and partners are urged to contribute to the fund so that more lives can be saved.

Ethiopia warns emergency drought aid to run out next month|10/06/2017|"WARDER, Ethiopia (Reuters) – Ethiopia will run out of emergency food aid for 7.8 million people hit by severe drought by the end of this month, the government and humanitarian groups said.

Successive failed rains blamed by meteorologists on fluctuations in ocean temperatures known as the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) have created a series of severe back-to-back droughts in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa region.

In Ethiopia, the number of people now critically short of food is expected to rise by at least two million by next month, according to figures compiled by the government and its humanitarian partners.

Donors, international aid groups and the government say existing food aid for the current 7.8 million will run out as funds are critically short this year with Ethiopia receiving slightly more than half of the $930 million to meet requirements until July.

“We are in a dire situation,” John Aylieff, the World Food Programme’s representative in Ethiopia, said on Friday during a field trip to Warder in southeast Ethiopia, one of Ethiopia’s hardest-hit areas.

“We’ve got food running out nationally at the end of June. That means the 7.8 million people who are in need of humanitarian food assistance in Ethiopia will see that distribution cut abruptly at the end of June,” he added.

TREELESS PLAINS

Humanitarian groups fear donor fatigue is weighing on efforts to meet requirements.

Famine in northeast Nigeria, together with South Sudan, Yemen and Somalia, constitute the worst humanitarian crisis the world has faced since 1945, the U.N. said in March.

“There is donor fatigue because there are a lot of crises,” said Ahmed Al Meraikhi, the U.N. Secretary-General’s humanitarian envoy.

Addis Ababa allocated $272 million extra in 2015 and a further $109 million last year from its own coffers to deal with the drought.

However the government said it faced difficulties in sustaining similar targets this year.

“Last year, we spent a lot of money to confront this type of drought. It is very challenging,” said Mitiku Kassa, head of Ethiopia’s National Disaster Risk Management Commission.

Across the Horn of Africa, close to 17 million people need humanitarian aid due to drought, including 2.6 million in Kenya and 3.2 million in Somalia, according to the U.N.

In the treeless plains littered with makeshift plastic homes in Ethiopia’s Warder, bordering Somalia, displaced and destitute pastoralists said their entire herds had been decimated.

“We have had droughts before, but this time we have drought, diarrhea and disease,” said Ardo Yusuf, a 49-year old mother who said her entire livestock had succumbed to illness."|https://ecadforum.com/2017/06/10/ethiopia-warns-emergency-drought-aid-to-run-out-next-month/

Ethiopian Police Detain Journalists Reporting On Drought|08/08/2016|"(CPJ)— Ethiopian police On August 8 2016, detained three journalists reporting on the effects of a severe drought in the country before escorting them back to Addis Ababa with a warning not to work outside the capital, the Foreign Correspondents’ Association of Ethiopia said in a statement.

Fred de Sam Lazaro and Thomas Adair from the U.S. Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and Africa News Agency (ANA) correspondent Hadra Ahmed, who was working as a fixer and translator, were told by the police to report to the Shashemene town police station, about 240km from the capital.

Police confiscated their passports and their equipment and offered no reason for their detention. The team was taken back to Addis Ababa the next day under police escort, interrogated for a further six hours and then released with a warning not to report outside the capital.

“Hadra and her colleagues’ ordeal is the latest example in a long trend of the government preventing journalists from doing their work,” William Davison, the FCAE’s chairman, said in the statement. In March 16, police detained Davison and a translator in the eastern town of Awash, confiscated their equipment, and escorted them back to the capital, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported at the time.

Drought ravages Ethiopian communities, driving a rise in hunger|13/05/2016|"CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA Watching hungry schoolchildren in Ethiopia carefully put away one of the two biscuits they received at a food program, Msgr. John Kozar, president of Catholic Near East Welfare Association, found the act touching.

He realized they were taking the second biscuit home to share with younger siblings or their mothers.

Alarming levels of hunger, caused by the worst drought in about half a century, has left about 10 percent of all Ethiopians — some 10 million in all — in need of food aid, Kozar said in a May 11 telephone interview from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital.

When the rains have come, as they did in April as part of the El Nino weather phenomenon that drove the drought, flash flooding has resulted. The most recent floods left at least 50 people dead and nearly 120,000 displaced.

“People in this mountainous, very rural country face enormous challenges,” said Kozar, who was on a six-day visit to the country in the Horn of Africa.

Cattle, sheep and other animals essential to people’s livelihoods have been lost in the landslides from the torrential rains, he said.

“It will be many months before there is any yield from newly planted crops,” Kozar said. “Three weeks of rain is not going to end this drought or stop its far-reaching and devastating consequences.”

More than 83 percent of Ethiopians live in rural areas, where most rely on rain-fed agriculture.

“The food needs here are critical,” particularly for infants and pregnant and breast-feeding women, he said.

On a visit to a “humble parish school with no lighting” in Aiga, where CNEWA runs one of its school food programs, Kozar heard from teachers who told him that children often faint from hunger when they arrive for the day’s lessons.

“It’s common for children to walk a one- to three-hour journey on very steep mountainous terrain to get to school and then make the same journey home again,” he said.

About 500 people attended a May 9 funeral in a village church that required a four- to seven-hour walk from remote areas for most of mourners, Msgr. Kozar said.

“And that was just one-way,” he said, recalling that he saw the corpse being carried on the shoulders of men who were walking a long distance along “paths with a terrifying drop.”

The “devotion of the people I have met here, young and old, is incredible,” Kozar said.

“The mountainous trails are very dangerous, but still, people come regularly to Mass,” he added. “The Christian tradition is very significant to the lives of the people of Ethiopia.”

About 1 percent of Ethiopia’s population is Catholic, yet the church is the second-largest provider of health and education services, after the government.

CNEWA provides humanitarian aid through the local church, Kozar said.

With very few level areas on which to grow crops, Ethiopians plant “potatoes, corn, barley, whatever they can” in terraces on the slopes of mountains.

“I am amazed at what people here do with the little they have,” he said, noting that he visited a Catholic agricultural college where subsistence farmers were taught how to improve farming methods and advised on which crops provide good nutrition.

Catholic Relief Services complements the work of CNEWA. Kim Pozniak, CRS communications officer, described the landscape as “apocalyptic, with very little vegetation except dried-out scrub and bushes with thorns the length of my forearm” after an April visit to parts of Ethiopia hardest hit by the drought.

“I saw donkeys that had fallen down dead while their owners were taking them to get water” to carry back home, Pozniak said in a May 13 telephone interview.

Animals are Ethiopians’ “most valuable asset,” Pozniak said, and the drought has forced many families to sell any livestock they have out of desperation to feed their families.

CRS is distributing monthly food rations to 2.8 million Ethiopians, as well as running long-term education and aid and development programs in the country, she said.

In many cases, “we make simple interventions that have a huge impact,” she explained, adding that the agency has introduced savings and loans groups and trained people in water storage so it is available when crops are planted."|https://ecadforum.com/2016/05/13/drought-ravages-ethiopian-communities-driving-a-rise-in-hunger/

Fifteen million Ethiopians at risk

Famine hits again Ethiopia. More than 15milion people are now facing the worst crisis the country had in recent memory and if the International community does not respond immediately the catastrophe will be irreversible.

According to UN, the country needs $230m by the end of the year to alleviate the crisis. Children, women and elderly people are the most vulnerable. UNICEF’s estimation of 264,515 children need immediate food and food supplement to avert an acute malnutrition. The country is once again in the deadly cycle of drought and famine.

Ethiopia’s Drought Takes Toll on Children|02/05/2016|"(VOA) METAHARA DISTRICT, ETHIOPIA— Ethiopia is dealing with its worst drought in decades. Its crops failed last year, contributing to food shortages affecting at least 10 million of the east African country’s 99 million people.

Approximately 6 million of them are children, and they’re especially vulnerable to disease, hunger and thirst, according to UNICEF, the United Nations’ children’s fund. It estimates 435,000 of them risk acute malnutrition.

Beriti Hawas brought her malnourished 3-year-old child to a clinic in central district of Metahara district, saying, “My baby got sick because there is no food.”

Malnutrition is especially problematic for children, because it can slow or halt brain development and thinking abilities, explained Samuel Terfa of the nongovernmental organization Child Fund. He said it also could have immediate consequences, such as aggravating diarrhea.

Child Fund is among the humanitarian organizations helping the Ethiopian government to supply food. Over $800 million in emergency funding has been provided, but Ethiopia’s government and the United Nations estimate a total of $1.4 billion is needed this year. The bulk of the money is to provide food.

Only by receiving aid can Alko Bultum can feed her six children.

“Because of the drought, we have nothing except the government’s support,” she said, adding, “We have nothing at home. We have nothing to feed our children. We don’t have drinking water.”

Food aid will be needed into 2017 in Ethiopia and in other drought-stricken parts of eastern and southern Africa, experts say. The poor conditions are believed to be caused by the periodic weather phenomenon El Nino."|https://ecadforum.com/2016/05/02/ethiopias-drought-takes-toll-on-children/
The Cause of Ethiopia’s Recurrent Famine Is Not Drought, It Is Authoritarianism|24/08/2015|"by Dawit Ayele Haylemariam | Huffington Post

Twenty years ago one Ethiopian Diaspora in Washington asked the late Prime minister Meles Zenawi what his vision for the country was. A rather polite and amiable Meles outlined his vision in a very human centered way. He said he hopes that in ten years every Ethiopian will have enough to eat three times a day and after 20 years Ethiopians will not only have enough food but they will also have the luxury of choosing what they eat.

Here we are now. Three years have passed since Meles died in office after 21 years in power. Once again Ethiopia’s food crisis is topping the headline. As seasonal rain fails in Eastern and Southern parts of the country, famine is threatening millions of Ethiopians. The UN estimates over 10 million are in need of emergency food aid.

Why is famine and hunger so common in Ethiopia?

Many experts relate Ethiopia’s cyclical famine with the country’s dependence on Rainfed smallholder agriculture, drought, rapid population growth or agricultural market dysfunctions. Although these factors do have significant role in the matter, they tend to hide the critical cause of hunger in the country – lack of rights and accountable government.

Nobel Prize winner and economist Amartya Sen has extensively analyzed the relationship between democracy and famine in his book Development as Freedom. Sen argues democracies don’t have famines, only authoritarian systems do. Famine tend to happen in places where the victims are oppressed by dictators.

A historical investigation of famine also identified 30 major famines during the 20th century. All happened in countries led by autocratic rule or that were under armed conflict, four being in Ethiopia.

Why does autocracy lead to famine? The most fundamental reason is that autocrats often don’t care enough about the population to prevent famine. Autocrats maintain power through force, not popular approval. This argument has been proven true in the case of Ethiopia.

During 1983-1985 the worst famine in the country’s history had led to more than 400,000 deaths. Extensive investigation by Alexander De Waal in his book Evil Days: Thirty Years of War and Famine in Ethiopia has found “more than half this mortality can be attributed to human rights abuses that caused the famine to come earlier, strike harder, and extend further than would otherwise have been the case.” The military government is not only spent between $100 and $200 million to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the revolution while millions are starving, Mengistu’s regime also attempted to impose customs duties on aid shipments.

Similarly during the 1973-1974 Wollo famine, attempts to hide the reality of the situation by the Imperial Feudal System caused 300,000 deaths. This particular famine was not a problem of food shortage in the country but lack of ability to access food. The Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture Report of 1972 stated that output for 1972-1973 was only 7% lower than the previous year. Also, food price in Wollo were no higher-often substantially lower-than elsewhere in the country. The problem was the poor just couldn’t afford to buy. Meanwhile, Emperor Haile Selassie spend some $35 million to celebrate his eightieth birthday in 1973.

Unfortunately the trend of autocratic-led hunger has not changed under the current government either, if anything Meles’s regime took it to the next level.

In 2004 Humanitarian Exchange Magazine exposed that disregarding experts advise that the situation in the country was very severe and does qualifies as a famine, the government of Ethiopia and USAID conspired to downplay the 2002-2004 food crisis as “localized famine” in fear of global media attention and political dangers for the EPRDF. The report states “the lack of classic famine images….facilitates further disengagement by the media and Western publics, even as large numbers of vulnerable people face destitution, malnutrition, morbidity and mortality.”

Again 2010 in a report titled Development without Freedom: How Aid Underwrites Repression in Ethiopia, Human Right Watch extensively documented how the EPRDF is using development aid to suppress political dissent by conditioning access to essential safety net programs on support for the ruling party.

Today, once again the danger of another catastrophic famine is looming large on the horizon. Ongoing drought worsened by the El Niño global weather phenomenon has already caused deaths of many cattle and have put as many as 14 million people at risk.

After denying the problem for weeks; the government finally admitted to it but only to claim that it has enough food stock to tackle the problem. However, journalists on the ground has reported the government’s grain reserve has run out long ago. According to Barrie Came, WFP representative, the food supply by the UN is also not enough to curb the problem.

The government also argues the country has already realized food security at a national level, that is to say we have enough food in the country to feed everyone. The inherent flaw in this argument is that the presence of food in the country doesn’t necessarily mean those affected by drought will have access to it. As it was the case during the 1973 Wollo famine, when a crop fails it not only affects the food supply, it also destroys the employment and livelihood of farmers, denying them the ability to buy food from the market.

Reports have also shown that the government was informed of the risk of seasonal rain failure forecast as early as two months ago but it chose to keep it to itself. Had the government shared the information with the media and local governments to inform pastoralists to move their cattle near rivers or highlands, much of the animal loss would have been avoided and relief supports would have been delivered on time.

Democracy can effectively prevent famine

Why is the Ethiopia government acting so irresponsibly? The answer is simple – because there is no incentive for the government to work hard to avert famine. Amartya Sen argument related to absence of political incentives generated by election, multiparty politics and investigative journalism is also true in the case of Ethiopia.

The EPRDF led government has successfully wiped out all groups that might pose any form of threat to its power. Fresh from its 100% “election” victory, with very fragmented opposition parties, no civil society and no scope for uncensored public criticism, Hailemariam’s regime don’t have to suffer the political consequences of its failure to prevent famine.

If there were a democratic system to keep the government accountable, the state’s response would have been much different. For instance, Botswana, like Ethiopia, is prone to drought but a democracy since its independence in 1966, Botswana never had a famine. Botswana’s democratic government immediately deploys relief efforts during every drought, and even improves them from one drought to the next. Had the government in Botswana failed to undertake timely action, there would have been severe criticism and pressure from the opposition and maybe even bigger political cost in future elections. In contrast, the Ethiopian governments did not have to worry with those prospects.

Another Sen’s key argument is information flow and free press – democracy contributes greatly to bring out information that can have an enormous impact on policies for famine prevention. If it weren’t for the foreign media reporting and social media activists outcry, the government might have kept the current problem a secret for long and caused much greater damage than it already has. In Sen’s words “free press and an active political opposition constitute the best early warning system a country threatened by famine can have”

If aid organizations comprehensively and immediately deploy humanitarian assistance, the current crisis could be impelled with minimal damage. However, the argument that famine in Ethiopia is caused by drought doesn’t hold water anymore. Unless the problem is addressed from its roots, another famine is just a matter of time. For Ethiopia to truly achieve food security and avoid any dangers of famine in the future, nothing but building a democratic, transparent and accountable system is the solution."|https://ecadforum.com/2015/08/24/the-cause-of-ethiopias-recurrent-famine-is-not-drought-it-is-authoritarianism/
United States gives Ethiopia $91 million in drought aid for food and medicine|31/08/2017|"(Xinhua) ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The United States will provide an additional $91 million in humanitarian aid for Ethiopia to cope with a third straight year of drought, the top U.S. official in charge of assistance said Thursday.

The extra funding brings U.S. aid for food and medical care in Ethiopia to more than $450 million this year, said Mark Green, the new administrator of the United States Agency for International Development.

Green announced the extra aid after he met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. In a statement he read to reporters, Green said he also had urged the Ethiopian leader to take “concrete steps to create political space for all voices to be heard and to uphold constitutional and guaranteed rights.”

Earlier this month, Ethi­o­pia lifted a 10-month state of emergency following deadly clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters alleging right abuses and political cronyism.

According to USAID spokesman Clayton McCleskey, Green told Desalegn he was concerned conditions were deteriorating for people affected by the drought and encouraged the government to “show greater leadership and invest more resources to combat a worsening humanitarian crisis.”

Green, who is on his first trip abroad since starting the job three weeks ago, is in Ethiopia to highlight U.S. efforts to help impoverished countries emerge from crises like drought and famine better prepared to weather future setbacks.

New drought strikes millions in Ethiopia, still reeling from El Nino|16/01/2017|"New drought strikes millions in Ethiopia, still reeling from El Nino

NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – Millions of Ethiopians face a hunger crisis for a second consecutive year after drought hit sub-Saharan Africa’s second most populous nation, the United Nations said on Tuesday as it appealed for more than $900 million in aid.

A strong aid response to last year’s El Nino-linked drought, has almost halved the number of Ethiopians needing food aid to 5.6 million since mid-2016, but a lack of rains once again threatens the country’s ability to feed itself, it said.

“Last year, (we were)… able to mount the biggest drought response operation in global history,” Mitiku Kassa, head of Ethiopia’s National Disaster Risk Management Commission, said in a statement.

“Today we need that partnership once again as we face a new drought,” he said, appealing for $948 million in aid.

Aid is also being ramped up in drought-hit neighbouring Kenya and Somalia.

The United Nations’ humanitarian coordinator in Somalia, Peter de Clercq, warned on Tuesday of “a significant risk of further deterioration to famine”, appealing for $864 million for 3.9 million Somalis.

Ethiopia’s latest rain failure has mainly hit southern livestock-herding communities, unlike last year when hunger was worst in the north and west.

“The impact is expected to be most dire in early 2017 among livestock, with unusually early migrations, excess mortality rates and extreme emaciation,” the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a statement.

Eastern and southern Africa were hard hit in 2016 by drought exacerbated by El Nino – a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean – that wilted crops, slowed economic growth and drove food prices higher.

For Ethiopia, it was the worst drought in 50 years, and devastating for a country where eight out of 10 people depend on farming and livestock.

As the next drought bites, some families are still repaying loans taken out last year, while others are vulnerable because they have not replaced lost herds, FAO said.

“The legacy of last year’s El Niño along with low rainfall during a critical season pose renewed risks now, especially for pastoral communities,” it said, appealing for funds to buy animal feeds and to slaughter excess animals.

Almost 18 million Ethiopians received $1.7 billion in emergency aid in 2016, U.N. spokeswoman Choice Ufuoma Okoro told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, almost half of which came from the Ethiopian government.

Ethiopia faces new drought, seeks urgent aid for 5 million|29/01/2017|"WARDER, Ethiopia (AP) — The carcasses of goats and sheep litter the ground near the airstrip in this remote eastern region of Ethiopia, which is struggling to counter a new drought that authorities say has left 5.6 million people in urgent need of assistance.

U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O’Brien visited a local camp for displaced persons on Saturday, saying that “these people are really struggling to survive.” He cautioned, however, against “dramatizing by saying this may degenerate into famine.”

Last year’s drought, exacerbated by the El Nino climate phenomenon that affected seasonal rains, left 10.2 million people hungry and killed several hundred thousand of the animals that the local pastoralists depend on for their livelihood.

Sarah Aliso came to the Garlogube displaced persons camp from a village 70 kilometers (43 miles) away three weeks ago after all 50 of her family’s cattle perished.

“I have nothing to eat, so I came here with my 40-day-old baby. All of us are hungry and are praying for the rains to come soon,” she said, cleaning her child’s face.

For this drought, Ethiopia’s government is appealing for $948 million from the international community. The country’s disaster prevention chief, Mitiku Kassa, said the government has had to combat this new drought with little outside support, allocating than $47 million for the response.

The charity Save the Children warns that malnourished refugees are arriving from neighboring Somalia as well, compounding the crisis.

“Children are being hit particularly hard,” the aid group said in a statement, adding that a number of disease outbreaks affecting livestock have been reported."|https://ecadforum.com/2017/01/29/ethiopia-faces-new-drought-seeks-urgent-aid-for-5-million/
The Ethiopian regime covering up the severe effects of the drought|01/12/2015|"Ongoing drought in Ethiopia Being Hushed by its Own Government

by Fasil Girma | Untold Stories

Birtukan Ali, a woman living in a rural district in Ethiopia, became a sensation following BBC’s report about the ongoing drought and famine. The report, which aired on November 10 2015, sparked a new kind of debate on the government’s intention in trying to cover up the famine – a story that remains untold.

Journalist Clive Myrie featured the story of Birtukan Ali who is from a small village called “Kobo” which is located in the North East of Ethiopia. It is a place where the drought is widespread and the effect of it is highly visible. Birtukan told the reporter that her son recently died due to severe malnutrition as a result of the drought in the area. The reporter said that at least two children die in similar cases daily.

The drought, brought on by the El Niño, a weather phenomenon described as a periodic warming of the sea surface, has severely affected the country. Ethiopia is mainly an agrarian economy and the agriculture is fully dependant on rain fall. Ultimately this means that no rain results in no crops, and therefore no food. This year the rainfall was inadequate to cultivate crops for two consecutive seasons. The United Nations estimated that 8.2 million people in Ethiopia’s drought affected areas need relief assistance. UNICEF said that the drought is expected to be the worst in 30 years and that 350,000 children are expected to require treatment for extreme malnutrition.

Ethiopian Government Denies Famine

In a press release by the World Food Program, it is stated that “a dramatic increase in the number of people in need of relief assistance, from 2.5 million at the beginning of the year to 8.2 million in October, led to a serious funding gap”. The Ethiopian government says that it has allocated $192 million USD for emergency food and other assistance. However, the government and humanitarian agencies have said that Ethiopia needs nearly $600 million USD in international humanitarian assistance. The Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has called for international assistance by appealing for food aid to help feed the 8.2 million people that are affected by the drought. Nevertheless, at the same time, his government denies that there is a famine at all. Deputy Prime Minister, Demeke Mekonen, commented on the BBC report in an interview with a local journalist.

– It is obvious that the foreign media works with different bodies of special interest. There is no such thing as famine in Ethiopia these days, Demeke said.

Similarly, the Ethiopian embassy in the United Kingdom has condemned the BBC report as being “sensational”. The embassy denied reports of approximately two children dying from malnutrition in the area on a daily basis. Five days after the airing of the BBC’ program, government owned Amhara Mass Media Agency, which is based in Bahar-Dar, the capital of the regional state Amhara, presented a televised program that ridiculed BBC’s report. The program includes Birtukan’s interview with the regional media. This time, however, Birtukan claims that her son died of unspecified “sudden illnesses” and not because of the malnutrition as she had told the BBC reporter.

Felanemunemunim, a local journalist and social media activist who is mentioned by his nickname, followed the news on Ethiopian television. He says that regional governors report as if the agriculture is good enough to produce plenty of food.

– They were talking about it on television for more than four months, but the truth is as BBC reported, even if there was exaggeration.

Government Accused of Diminishing the Extent of the Famine

The statements made by the Ethiopian government have sparked a debate among Ethiopian human rights activists. According to them, the government is trying to cover up the severe effects of the drought.

Argaw Ashine, an exiled journalist based in USA and founder of the web based Amharic internet radio Wazema, which is getting a wide acceptance in the Ethiopian online community for its credible information, commented on the drought. According to him, it is obvious that the Ethiopian government continues to hide the drought from the media, and he believes that they will continue to do so despite the United Nations and others predicting that the worst is yet to come. Admitting that there is a famine would create a problem for the Ethiopian government.

– It costs them politically. The success story they fed to Ethiopians and the international community falls severely short after an exposition of the hunger.

Wazema radio reports that the federal government passes strict instructions to regional governments and Ethiopian embassies all over the world to not give any kind of information to any media regarding the ongoing drought and famine. The instructions include denying access for all journalists to drought affected areas and to take necessary measures for nongovernmental organizations to not leak information regarding the crises to the media.

According to Argaw, media restriction is common during humanitarian crises, and specifically the local media is blocked from reporting the situation.

– They may allow some big international media organizations in to specific locations for only a couple of days. International media reporting is part of convincing the international community to send aid, yet the government does not want an in-depth report on the cause of the problem.

– Authoritarian governments are good at controlling the information flow, and the role of media during crises in Ethiopia is kept at a minimum. Media should be at the forefront to end hunger. Development and better life is impossible without vibrant media in Ethiopia, Argaw said.

A Call to Take Responsibility

Exiled Ethiopian human rights advocate Yared Hailemariam, who is based in Brussels, speculates on why the government denies that the drought has turned into a famine. It is his opinion that the denial is due to a lack of competent governance, democracy, social justice and political will of the last three regime’s. He also says that the EPRDF (The Government of Ethiopia, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front) is highly corrupt, and that the development is not what it seems to be.

– The so called development is not humanitarian based – rather it is based on numbers and the economic aspect, but there is still lots of confusion regarding the double digit growth that has been reported to us over the last few years.

Yared says that the first thing the government should do is to rescue those in need. The level of the ongoing and upcoming disaster that would take many lives, needs to be reduced. It is also important to take lessons from the past.

– The challenge that is now before us is how we can go about ensuring that such things will not happen again. That is the problem we could not find a solution to since the 1958 famine. It takes political, economic, social and cultural reforms and changes to tackle such problems once and for all.

Exiled journalist and social media activist Zerihun Tesfaye, who is based in the USA, says that everyone has a responsibility to create awareness of the problem. His opinion is that an effective use of social media is a necessary tool for addressing the issue.

– We have challenges regarding the acquisition of accurate information from rural areas, a low internet penetration rate, and fear amongst people to share stories. However, I still believe that a well-coordinated social media campaign will surely bring something good to our people, and save lives.

The question should not only be why the government is covering up the drought. The most important question is how widespread the drought is – and how many are suffering as a result. For the Ethiopian governmental officials who have been bragging for almost a decade about the country’s approximate 11% economic growth, it seems to be very hard for them to swallow their pride and face the fact that more than 8.2 million people are starving due to the ongoing widespread drought.

Whether covered up or not, a very big number of people are affected by the drought, and some of them are dying. Emergency assistance, and a real awareness of the situation, is a must to help out these people. Their stories need to be told."|https://ecadforum.com/2015/12/01/the-ethiopian-regime-covering-up-the-severe-effects-of-the-drought/
Ethiopia: East Africa food prices reach record levels due to drought|14/02/2017|"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – Drought in East Africa has sent prices of staples such as maize and sorghum soaring, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on Tuesday, warning that a sharp increase in food prices could lead to renewed hunger in the region.

Prices of staple cereals have doubled in some markets, reaching record and near-record levels in swathes of Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania, FAO said.

“Sharply increasing prices are severely constraining food access for large numbers of households with alarming consequences in terms of food insecurity,” Mario Zappacosta, FAO senior economist, said in a statement.

In South Sudan, food prices were between two and four times higher than a year ago while in Kenya prices of maize were up by about a third, FAO said.

In Somalia, maize and sorghum harvests were estimated to be 75 percent lower than usual and more than half of the country’s population, mostly in rural areas, was facing hunger, it said.

Trends in East Africa were in contrast with the stable trend of the organization’s global Food Price Index, which measures monthly price changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, FAO said.

It said crops in East Africa had been depleted by drought exacerbated by the El Nino weather phenomenon that ended last year, and poor and erratic rainfall in recent months.

About 12 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia were at risk of hunger due to recurring droughts, according to FAO figures.

Unusually high prices of staples posed an extra challenge for nomadic herders as shortages of water and pastureland had a harmful impact on animals, leading to lower livestock prices and leaving pastoralists with even less income, FAO said.

In Somalia, prices of goats were up to 60 percent lower than a year ago while in Kenya they declined by up to 30 percent in pastoralist areas, the FAO said."|https://ecadforum.com/2017/02/14/ethiopia-east-africa-food-prices-reach-record-levels-due-to-drought/
Drought emergency spirals in Ethiopia amid major aid shortages|07/03/2017|"NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – Millions of drought-stricken Ethiopians needing food, water and emergency medical care are not receiving it due to funding shortages, the United Nations said, warning the crisis will worsen if spring rains fail as predicted.

Some 5.6 million people need food aid in the Horn of Africa nation, which has been hit by a series of back-to-back droughts.

“The needs relating to the developing emergency exceed resources available to date,” the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Monday.

“Each day without food assistance exponentially increases human suffering, lengthens the recovery period of affected people, puts increasing pressure on humanitarian and development systems, and the interventions become that much more expensive.”

It is three times cheaper to treat children who are moderately, rather than severely, malnourished, it said.

But it takes at least four months to procure, ship and deliver emergency supplies to Ethiopia, it said.

The U.N. appealed for more than $900 million in aid for Ethiopia in January. [nL5N1F72RN]

Almost 13 million people across the Horn of Africa need aid due to drought, including 2.7 million in Kenya, 2.9 million people in Somalia and 1.6 million people in Uganda, OCHA said.

The situation is expected to worsen across the region as the “belg” Spring rains are predicted to fail.

“The expected below normal rainfall will negatively impact belg land preparation and planting, as well as water and pasture availability; with a spiral effect on food and nutritional security of affected communities,” OCHA said.

At least $2.7 million is required each week to provide water via more than 600 trucks to millions of people, mostly livestock herders in southern Ethiopia, but there is only funding for 300-odd trucks, OCHA said.

Humanitarians are already short of cooking oil to distribute to hungry Ethiopians, with pulses and cereals likely to run out in the next few months, OCHA added.

There is also no money to deploy emergency medical teams and health supplies to southern areas not covered by health facilities, it said.

Starvation looms as food runs out in drought-hit Ethiopia|21/06/2017|"(AFP) — The Somali people of Ethiopia’s southeast have a name for the drought that has killed livestock, dried up wells and forced hundreds of thousands into camps: sima, which means “equalized”.

It’s an appropriate name, they say, because this drought has left no person untouched, spared no corner of their arid region. And it has forced 7.8 million people across the whole of Ethiopia handouts to stay alive.

But by next month, that food will have run out, aid agencies say.

Droughts are common in Ethiopia, and in past years the government and international community have mounted impressive efforts to curb starvation.

This year though, Africa’s second most-populous country is struggling to find the money for food aid, say aid agencies.

“We’re looking at the food pipeline actually breaking, so the food is running out in about a month’s time,” said John Graham, country director for Save the Children. “After that, we don’t know what’s going to happen.”

Distracted donors

Once a global byword for starvation and poverty after a famine in 1984-85 killed hundreds of thousands, Ethiopia has seen its economy grow rapidly in the last decade. Health indicators such as infant mortality and malaria deaths have also improved.

A stronger economy allowed Ethiopia to spend an impressive $766 million (683 million euros) fighting one of its worst droughts in decades in 2015-16.

This year however, things are different.

Economic growth has slowed, due in part to protests spurred by long-simmering grievances against Ethiopia’s one-party state.

Donors have also been distracted by other regional crises.

To the southeast, Somalia is suffering from severe drought, with warnings it could tip into famine.

Ethiopia’s western neighbor, South Sudan, has suffered four months of famine, and extreme hunger is at its highest levels ever after more than three years of civil war.

Ethiopia’s western neighbor, South Sudan, has suffered four months of famine, and extreme hunger is at its highest levels ever after more than three years of civil war.

Ethiopia by contrast has a strong central government and is relatively free from conflict.

But with the situation so desperate in the region, donors aren’t responding to the country’s emergency as they have in the past, said Mitiku Kassa, head of Ethiopia’s National Disaster Risk Management Commission, Mitiku Kassa.

“They are stressed with the needs, especially from those countries which (have) declared famine,” Mitiku said.

“That is why it is underfunded.”

“They are stressed with the needs, especially from those countries which (have) declared famine,” Mitiku said.

“That is why it is underfunded.”

‘Skipping meals is common’

Even though Ethiopia has contributed $117 million of its own money this year and the international community $302 million, a funding gap of $481 million remains, according to the United Nations.

In the drought ravaged town of Warder, the hundreds of displaced families crowding a ramshackle camp say handouts of rice and sugar are becoming less frequent.

“Skipping meals is common,” said Halimo Halim, a grandmother living with her children in a shelter made of sticks and pieces of plastic. “Skipping is the order of the day.”

Families of nomadic herders such as Halimo’s are central to the economy of Ethiopia’s southeastern Somali region.

The drought has deprived goats, sheep and donkeys of water, killing them or making them so weak that by the time the rains come they perish in the cold.

Around 465,000 people who have lost their livestock have migrated to an estimated 250 camps in the region.

The settlements are often located near water sources, but that presents its own problems.

In Warder, workers are present around the clock at nearby wells to make sure people drawing water chlorinate it before they drink it, lest they contract “acute watery diarrhoea”, which has broken out in the region.

Some aid workers say this is actually cholera, which Ethiopia has long been accused of covering up to protect its image.

Paying the bill

Aid agencies have turned to so-called “non-traditional” donors like the Gulf countries for funding.

At the same time they are keeping a nervous eye on budget negotiations in top funder the United States, where President Donald Trump has proposed slashing the aid budget.

But some humanitarians privately complain that the Ethiopian government isn’t doing enough to call attention to its plight.

They argue that Addis Ababa does not want to distract from its development gains or resurrect the old image of Ethiopia as a place of mass starvation.

“There is no shortage of funds to combat drought,” communications minister Negeri Lencho insisted earlier this month.

If the international community doesn’t send more money, Mitiku said the government would be “forced” to tap its development budget for drought relief in July.

But with a lead time of about four months required to procure emergency food, the UN says that may be too late.

In Warder, those uprooted by drought, like Sanara Ahmed, are wondering how long they can survive on unreliable food handouts.

“Some support was there, but it cannot substitute for our dependability on our livelihood,” Sanara said."|https://ecadforum.com/2017/06/21/starvation-looms-as-food-runs-out-in-drought-hit-ethiopia/
Number of Ethiopians needing food aid surges to 7.7 million due to drought|27/04/2017|"(Reuter) — The number of Ethiopians who need food aid owing to drought has surged by more than two million from 5.6 million at the beginning of the year, an official said on Thursday.

In January, the United Nations appealed for more than $900 million in aid for the Horn of Africa country, which has been hit by repeated droughts.

Some areas of Ethiopia’s Oromiya, Amhara, and SNNP regions are now facing severe water shortages, in addition to areas where the main harvests had failed this year, said Debebe Zewdie, head of public relations at the National Disaster Risk Management Commission.

“The number has risen to more than 7.7 million people. 432,000 tonnes of food is needed until the end of the year,” he told state-owned Ethiopian News Agency.

Although it has one of the highest growth rates in Africa, Ethiopia’s economy still depends heavily on farming, which employs three-quarters of the workforce in the nation of over 90 million people.

Last year, failed spring and summer rains worsened by the El Nino weather phenomenon affected 10.2 million people.

Altogether, almost 13 million people across the Horn of Africa region currently require aid, including 2.7 million in Kenya, 2.9 million in Somalia and 1.6 million in Uganda, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Drought striking Ethiopia, leading to hunger crisis|19/01/2017|"For decades, Ethiopia has struggled with drought, induced by El Niño phenomena. Subsequently, the country suffered from water scarcities, crop failure and food insecurity. The devastating effects of droughts is generally noticed among developing countries such as Ethiopia. These countries, are more vulnerable, due to the lack of infrastructures and food security programmes.

Aid needed to curb the hunger crisis

For a second consecutive year, Ethiopia is facing drought-induced crisis, affecting lives and livelihood within the country. This new episode, is putting a wider threat on the food securities, for a country that had his share of hunger crisis. Over the years, Ethiopia has endured several drought episodes, that strained the agriculture and deteriorated food supplies.

The impact of drought is seen mainly on the sharp deterioration of livestock, and crops, across Ethiopia. As a result, Ethiopians have to face another season of limited food access.

According to the FAO (food Association Organization) “The impact is expected to be most dire in early 2017 among livestock, with unusually early migrations, excess mortality rates and extreme emaciation,” the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a statement.

The FAO, also highlighted that consecutive droughts are inflicting malnutrition on the population especially on youngsters, pregnant and lactating women. Thus, emergency plans need to be implemented in Ethiopia and neighbouring countries affected. Since Ethiopia, is facing an acute food crisis, food aids shall be provided for those in needs.

“Last year, (we were) … able to mount the biggest drought response operation in global history,” explained Mitiku Kassa, from the National Disaster Risk Management Commission in Ethiopia.

“Today we need that partnership once again as we face a new drought,” he pointed.

In 2016, about 18 million Ethiopians, received $ 1.7 billion in aid, said UN. Spokeswoman to Reuters.

Lately, the UN, apealed for at least $ 900 in aid to control the hunger crisis in Ethiopia.
