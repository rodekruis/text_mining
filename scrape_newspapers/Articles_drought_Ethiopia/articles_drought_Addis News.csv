ADDIS ABABA, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) — Heads of three UN food agencies have jointly called on the global community to strengthen drought response interventions in Ethiopia.

The call was made early this week in Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa by the visiting chiefs of the three UN food agencies who are David Beasley, Executive Director of the World Food Programme (WFP), José Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the world Food and Agricultural Organizations (FAO), and Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).

The officials, after their four-day joint visit in drought-affected Tigray and Somali regional states of Ethiopia from September 1 to 4, highlighted the critical food and nutrition security situations underway in the east African country.

Noting the need for collaborative efforts in tackling the drought scenario from deteriorating further, the three chiefs also praised the Ethiopian government’s efforts in responding to the crisis.

“We need to be grateful to what the Ethiopian government has been able to achieve working with donors,” said Beasley.

The government of Ethiopia and its humanitarian partners had launched the 2017 Humanitarian Requirements Document looking for 948 million U.S. dollars to reach close to 5.6 million people with emergency food and non-food assistance.

As rains failed for the third consecutive year in southern and southeastern parts of Ethiopia, the worst drought affected areas, the number of Ethiopians who are in need of emergency humanitarian assistance has since then escalated to more than 8.5 million during the second half of 2017.

The three agency chiefs also discussed with senior Ethiopian government officials and representatives from other partner organizations on how best to strengthen the support to continue meeting Ethiopia’s development goals while simultaneously addressing humanitarian challenges along the way.

As new drought hits Ethiopia, UN urges support for Government’s ‘remarkable’ efforts|29/01/2017|"29 January 2017  Commending the Ethiopian Government and humanitarian partners on the response to last year’s El Niño drought that left 10.2 million people needing food assistance, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres and UN aid chief Stephen O’Brien today said the international community must show “total solidarity” with country as it faces a new drought.

“This High-Level event must express our total solidarity with the Ethiopian people and the Ethiopian Government. And let’s be clear: that solidarity is not a matter of generosity. It is a matter of justice and of self-interest,” the Secretary-General told those gathered for the event, held earlier today in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, on the margins of the 28th Summit of the African Union.

It is a matter of justice in relation to the enormous generosity of the Ethiopian people themselves, he said, recalling that during his 10 years as UN High Commissioner for Refugees, he had witnessed the way Ethiopia became not only the largest African refugee-hosting country but the country with the most determined policy of keeping all its borders open, even in the most difficult security situations; “an example that, I would say, needs to be thought about in a world where unfortunately, so many borders are being closed.”

Moreover, he said, the current crisis has not caught the Government and the people of Ethiopia unprepared, even if the magnitude of the crisis clearly is above the capacity of the Horn of Africa country to resolve. “Ethiopia has persistently applied a policy of building resilience in relation to the natural disasters that unfortunately with climate change have come to be more and more frequent and intense,” explained Mr. Guterres.

Showing solidarity with Ethiopia is a matter of self-interest “because the link between humanitarian and development with peace and security is growing everywhere, and to invest in building resilience of populations and to invest in the best humanitarian needs in situations of stress like the one we are facing is also to contribute to strengthen peace and security,” said Mr. Guterres, noting that a number of countries around Ethiopia are in the midst of deep crises – Somalia, South Sudan and Eritrea.

In Ethiopia and beyond, development and peace and security must be tackled jointly – UN chief

Describing Ethiopia as a “pillar of stability” in the region, he said the international community cannot allow the effect of drought to be a promoter of additional instability, social unrest, or conflict as this would have dreadful consequences “not only in relation to the conflicts in the area but in connection to displacements of populations, in a world that is so little inclined to receive more migrants, and to global terrorism that is now a threat everywhere.”

With all this in mind, he urged the participants to “transform this session of solidarity in a commitment to work together not only to address the pressing humanitarian needs of Ethiopia but to join efforts in addressing the huge challenges from a development perspective, a sustainable development perspective and from a peace and security perspective the world faces today.”

Just back from a three-day visit to Ethiopia to see first-hand the impact of failed rains in the southern parts of the county, Mr. O’Brien, who is the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that in Warder zone in Ethiopia’s Somali Region, he had witnessed the “immense impact” the drought is having on people’s lives and livelihoods.

Below average rains in south and southeastern parts of the country caused by the negative Indian Ocean Dipole have led to a new “lowland” drought. Among the most affected areas are parts of Somali and Afar regions and a number of lowland areas of Oromia and SNNP regions. The new drought has led to severe shortages of water and pasture in the pastoral and agro-pastoral communities. Deteriorating livestock body condition and loss of livestock are also being reported as well as high levels of acute and moderate malnutrition.

“We have no time to lose” – UN Emergency Relief Coordinator

“We need to act now before it is too late,” said Mr. O’Brien, calling on the international partners to join the Ethiopian Government in funding the 2017 Humanitarian Requirements Document, which seeks $948 million to assist 5.6 million people, whose lives, livelihoods and well-being depend on support from relief partners.

As effective as the humanitarian response to the 2016 El Niño drought has been, Ethiopian farmers and herders in affected areas are still living on the brink, unable to build back their livestock herds, or reinvigorate their small farms, and struggling to sustain themselves and their families, said Mr. O’Brien.

“We have no time to lose. Livestock are already dying; pastoralists and farmers are already fleeing their homes in search of water and pasture; children – more often girls – are dropping out of school to support with household chores, and hunger and malnutrition levels will rise soon if assistance does not arrive on time, particularly among women who are more likely to suffer from health problems and malnutrition during droughts,” he stressed.

U.S. to give Ethiopia $91 million in drought aid for food and medicine|01/09/2017|"The United States will provide an additional $91 million in humanitarian aid for Ethiopia to cope with a third straight year of drought, the top U.S. official in charge of assistance said Thursday.

The extra funding brings U.S. aid for food and medical care in Ethiopia to $454 million this year, said Mark Green, the new administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. An extra $210 million in U.S. aid has gone to development projects.

Green announced the additional aid after he met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. In a statement that he read to reporters, Green said he had also urged the Ethiopian leader to take “concrete steps to create political space for all voices to be heard and to uphold constitutional and guaranteed rights.”

In August, Ethi­o­pia lifted a 10-month state of emergency imposed after deadly clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters who were alleging human rights abuses and political cronyism.

“What I said to him is, ‘We look at what countries need around the world to strengthen their ability to deliver for their people,’ ” Green told reporters later.

By managing drought, Ethiopia now serves as a model for its neighbours|08/04/2017|"By Simon Allison

The Horn of Africa is suffering its worst drought in decades, with devastating humanitarian consequences. Two districts in South Sudan are officially in famine. Areas of Somalia and Yemen are on the brink. Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of death, while millions face severe disruption to their lives and livelihoods.

The drought has affected Ethiopia too. In 2015, it experienced its most severe dry spell in 50 years, and there are fears that 2017’s rains will fail too. But in this East African country, once the poster child for poverty in Africa, no one is talking about famine. Unlike Somalia and South Sudan, Ethiopia is doing something right.

“Only last year in Ethiopia, the drought in many places was worse than the terrible drought that we remember in 1985. But because of real economic progress, better preparation and a strong, timely response by the Ethiopian government and international community, suffering was so much lower that it barely hit our screens,” said Mark Goldring, the chief executive of development charity Oxfam.

In 1984-1985, the rains in Ethiopia failed for a third year in succession, and that year so did most of the country’s crops. When BBC journalist Michael Buerk went to investigate the crisis, he found a famine of “biblical” proportions. Buerk’s iconic TV report showed thousands of gaunt, skeletal people in a town in northern Ethiopia, all desperately scrabbling for food aid. “This place, say workers here, is the closest thing to hell on earth,” Buerk intones.

Buerk’s report would inspire Irish rocker Bob Geldof to launch a massive public fund-raising exercise, culminating in the hit single Do they Know it’s Christmas? and the 1985 Live Aid concert. But it was already too late. Ultimately, between 600,000 and a million Ethiopians would die as a result of the famine.

Thirty-two years later, Ethiopia is facing an even worse natural disaster. But although food is scarce, and the situation remains precarious for many, Ethiopia has avoided repeating the mistakes of its past. So how, exactly, has it managed to prevent another disastrous famine, and what lessons should the governments of Somalia and South Sudan – as well as other food-insecure nations such as Nigeria and Yemen – be learning from Ethiopia’s example?

“As we saw in Ethiopia last year, which suffered its worst drought in decades, it did not suffer the worst crisis. We did not see that situation [like the 1980s] in Ethiopia because there was a very robust response to the drought,” said Challis McDonough, a spokesperson for the World Food Program in East Africa.

The most significant factor in that response is also perhaps the most obvious: Ethiopia actually planned ahead. In 2005, the government established the productive safety net programme, a distribution network designed to help Ethiopia’s rural poor to withstand exactly these kinds of shocks. It works by identifying households that are chronically food insecure and then providing transfers of either cash or food to help them out. Even in good years, when the rains do come and the crops thrive, many Ethiopians need help from the government – between 7 and 8 million annually – so the programme has already been stress-tested. When needed, the programme was ready to mitigate the worst consequences of the current drought by allowing additional food aid to quickly reach those who needed it, and by providing international humanitarian organisations with an efficient means to distribute international aid.

Other government initiatives included a district-by-district early warning system and the establishment of a national food reserve. The country also put plenty of its own money into combating the drought: $1 billion (Dh3.67m) from international donors was complemented by $735 million from the Ethiopian government, which represents more than 10 per cent of its $61.54 billion GDP.

The international community is united in its praise for the Ethiopian response.

UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said: “This crisis has not caught the government and the people of Ethiopia unprepared, even if the magnitude of the crisis clearly is above the capacity of the country to resolve. Ethiopia has persistently applied a policy of building resilience in relation to the natural disasters that unfortunately with climate change have come to be more and more frequent and intense. And not only a consistent policy of strengthening resilience but of creating the reserve necessary for Ethiopia itself to respond to the crisis.”

Another major factor in Ethiopia’s favour this time around is its political stability. Droughts are natural disasters; famines are not. As the World Food Program’s McDonough explained: “A lot of factors are different from crisis to crisis, but the things we have in common between South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Nigeria is the level of conflict and insecurity that is an underlying cause of the malnutrition and that tremendously complicate the efforts of humanitarians organisations to get assistance to people.”

In the 1980s, conflict and chronic political instability in Ethiopia made it extremely difficult for humanitarian organisations to access affected areas, exacerbating the scale and severity of the problem. But Ethiopia today is a very different place. The government, led by the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, has maintained a tight grip on power since 1991. Too tight, say critics: the government is notoriously hostile to criticism, and has a poor track record when it comes to protecting civil and political rights. Most recently, Ethiopian security forces have been accused of killing more than 400 peaceful protesters during a series of demonstrations by members of the marginalised Oromo community.

In private, Ethiopian diplomats argue that the end justifies the means; that the government’s authoritarian tendencies are necessary to keep a lid on political tensions. Ethiopia’s effective drought response suggests they have a point. But whatever one’s opinion of the government, credit where credit is due: Ethiopia’s relative stability – especially compared to its troubled neighbours in Somalia and South Sudan – has allowed the country to plan ahead and implement the policies necessary to prevent a repeat of the 1984 famine.

But now Ethiopia risks becoming a victim of its own success. Although a famine has been averted, at least 5.6 million people still require continuing emergency food assistance. And the fact that Ethiopia is not on the brink of famine might make it harder to raise the foreign funding necessary to maintain that emergency aid.

That funding is getting increasingly scarce: so far, the United Nations has raised just 6 per cent of the $2.1 billion it needs to reach 12 million people with life-saving aid. Ethiopia must now compete for these scarce resources with the likes of South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and Yemen – all countries facing far more severe food security issues.

The citizens of these countries will be wishing that their governments had taken a few lessons from Ethiopia’s drought-resisting playbook.

Ethiopia’s drought has left 7.7 million people hungry|29/04/2017|"AFP

ADDIS ABABA – The number of people in need of food aid in Ethiopia’s drought-hit regions has surged to 7.7 million, some 2 million more than estimated earlier this year, state media reported on Friday.

The National Disaster Risk Management Commission said in January that failed rains would put 5.6 million people in need of emergency food this year in three of the country’s nine regions: Oromia, Amhara and the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’ Region.

Public relations director Ababe Zewdie told the state-run Ethiopian News Agency that cold snaps and localised flooding in some areas had further decimated what crops had managed to grow, causing the commission to revise its estimates upwards.

“Over $742-million (R9.6-billion) is needed to support the people affected by drought and more than 432,000 tons of additional food up until early July,” the news agency reported.

Ethiopia is prone to droughts, and the lack of rains in the country’s highlands forced 10.2 million people to seek food assistance last year.

The United Nations has warned that this year’s drought in East Africa could lead to 17 million people going hungry across the region."|https://addisnews.net/ethiopias-drought-has-left-7-7-million-people-hungry/

In Ethiopia, drought shoves the ordinary – even marriage – just out of reach|05/07/2017|"—In another life, it would have gone like this: Duniya in a floor-length dress, something gauzy and loudly colored; Muftah tall and slender and serious beside her.

Duniya and Muftah. Muftah and Duniya. They had known each other since they were kids, when they spent long, slow days together walking their families’ cattle and camel herds across the scrubby brush to pasture or water. For a long time, they were friends, close ones, until one day they were not only that anymore. It was that simple, she says, and that obvious.

She thinks of it often, that wedding that would have been. There would have been seven days of dancing – the entire village gathered around them – and fresh roasted goat every night. She would have eaten soor, a soft corn porridge, mashed with milk, butter, and sugar, and worn a different new dress each night. And then, when it was done, she and Muftah would have slipped quietly into the rest of their lives.

Instead, she is here – in a sun-baked settlement of displaced persons near the market town of Gode – and he is there – 40 miles away in the parched village where they both grew up. She hasn’t seen him in two months. She worries, she says, that she never will again.

Ethiopia is facing a killer drought. But it’s going almost unnoticed.|02/05/2017|"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The announcement by the United Nations in March that 20 million people in four countries were teetering on the edge of famine stunned the world and rammed home the breadth of the humanitarian crisis faced by so many in 2017.

Yet even as donors struggle to meet the severe needs in the war-torn nations of Nigeria, South Sudan, Somalia and Yemen, another crisis, more environmental in nature, is taking place nearby — nearly unnoticed.

On Thursday, the Ethiopian government increased its count of the number of people requiring emergency food aid from 5.6 million to 7.7 million, a move that aid agencies say was long overdue. The figure is expected to rise further as southeast Ethiopia confronts another fierce drought.

But with food crises erupting across the continent and the government’s budget strained by last year’s drought, the money isn’t there to fight it. There could eventually be as many people in Ethiopia needing emergency food assistance as in Somalia and South Sudan combined.

Mary Robinson in plea over Ethiopian drought|06/07/2016|"Former president Mary Robinson has urged world leaders to turn their focus to the severe drought, brought about by shifting weather patterns, that has left millions of Africans in need of food aid.

El Niño, a water-warming weather pattern in the Pacific Ocean, has led to sharply reduced rainfall across densely populated swathes of Ethiopia and other African states. Its effects have been worsened by climate change, leaving an estimated 10.2 million people urgently in need of food assistance in Ethiopia alone.

On a visit to Ethiopia in her capacity as UN special envoy for climate and El Niño, Mrs Robinson said there was a funding gap of $518 million for efforts to mitigate the effects of the drought in the country. However, with the international community preoccupied with migration, Brexit and conflict zones, it was difficult to garner global attention for the problem.

“I don’t think the impact of El Niño, aggravated by climate change, has received the attention that it should have from the international community,” she said after meeting the Ethiopian foreign minister, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

“Not only is it severe here in Ethiopia and needs more support, but it’s also affecting southern Africa very badly. It’s affecting parts of central America, such as Honduras. It’s affecting parts of Asia, like Vietnam. ”

El Niño, which occurs every two to seven years, affects weather systems around the globe, resulting in some regions receiving more rain and leaving other suffering from drought. It is usually followed by La Niña, which is the cooling of the Pacific Ocean, and which can also bring floods and droughts to many regions. International agencies have called for a La Niña conference to take place this September to highlight the severity of the deepening crisis and the severe funding shortfall.

Mrs Robinson, who is travelling with the heads of Trócaire, Goal and Concern, all of which work in Ethiopia, said it was essential to agree a blueprint so that international organisations and affected countries would be better placed to react to the next El Niño.

Co-ordinated response

“We can try to really make sure that we bring together in a non- silo way all the partnership support for the countries affected, including Ethiopia, and that they would be in the lead in early-warning and trigger that coordinated response,” she said.

“Then I think it would be less impactful on the countries that are targeted by El Niño and La Nina, which is coming up at the end of this year.”

Mrs Robinson’s visit coincides with a growing food crisis in the Horn ofAfrica, where aid agencies have been pleading for the international community to do more to prevent this becoming the worst food emergency there since 1985. The UN has said the level of acute need has already exceeded levels seen in the drought of 2011, which claimed some 200,000 lives in neighbouring Somalia.

Particularly vulnerable

Dr Tedros said the international response had initially been slow but that his country had benefited from an early-warning system that allowed it to detect El Niño early. The government in

Addis Ababa had also accessed its own food reserve and allocated $800 million to the aid effort.

Dr Tedros stressed that while Ethiopia was particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, it did relatively little to cause the problem – a reference to the fact that the country has one of the lowest per capita carbon emissions in the world.

“We have contributed nothing, but we are the victims. And although we are the victims we want to be part of the solution,” he said.

On Wednesday, Mrs Robinson will travel to the northern Tigray region, which has been badly affected by the drought.

Drought emergency spirals in Ethiopia amid major aid shortages|11/02/2016|"By Katy Migiro

NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – Millions of drought-stricken Ethiopians needing food, water and emergency medical care are not receiving it due to funding shortages, the United Nations said, warning the crisis will worsen if spring rains fail as predicted.

Some 5.6 million people need food aid in the Horn of Africa nation, which has been hit by a series of back-to-back droughts.

“The needs relating to the developing emergency exceed resources available to date,” the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Monday.

“Each day without food assistance exponentially increases human suffering, lengthens the recovery period of affected people, puts increasing pressure on humanitarian and development systems, and the interventions become that much more expensive.”

It is three times cheaper to treat children who are moderately, rather than severely, malnourished, it said.

But it takes at least four months to procure, ship and deliver emergency supplies to Ethiopia, it said.

The U.N. appealed for more than $900 million in aid for Ethiopia in January. [nL5N1F72RN]

Almost 13 million people across the Horn of Africa need aid due to drought, including 2.7 million in Kenya, 2.9 million people in Somalia and 1.6 million people in Uganda, OCHA said.

The situation is expected to worsen across the region as the “belg” Spring rains are predicted to fail.

“The expected below normal rainfall will negatively impact belg land preparation and planting, as well as water and pasture availability; with a spiral effect on food and nutritional security of affected communities,” OCHA said.

At least $2.7 million is required each week to provide water via more than 600 trucks to millions of people, mostly livestock herders in southern Ethiopia, but there is only funding for 300-odd trucks, OCHA said.

Humanitarians are already short of cooking oil to distribute to hungry Ethiopians, with pulses and cereals likely to run out in the next few months, OCHA added.

There is also no money to deploy emergency medical teams and health supplies to southern areas not covered by health facilities, it said.

Eastern and southern Africa were hard hit in 2016 by drought exacerbated by El Nino – a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean – that wilted crops, slowed economic growth and drove food prices higher.

Drought Highlights the Plight of Ethiopia’s Internally Displaced|11/05/2017|"Crossing a border entitles refugees to international protection, whereas internally-displaced persons remain the responsibility of national governments – often falling through the gaps as a result.

Gode, Ethiopia: Displaced pastoralists gather around newly-arrived drums of brown water as a water truck speeds off to make further deliveries to settlements that have sprung up along the main road running out of Gode, one of the major urban centres in Ethiopia’s Somali region.

Looking at the drums’ brackish-looking contents, a government official explains the sediment will soon settle and the water has been treated, making it safe to drink – despite appearances.

“For those who have lost everything, all they can now do is go to a government assistance site for food and water,” said Charlie Mason, the humanitarian director at Save the Children in Ethiopia.

A total of 58 internally displaced person (IDP) settlements in the region are currently receiving assistance in the form of water trucking and food supplies, according to the government.

But 222 sites containing nearly 4,00,000 displaced individuals were identified in a survey conducted by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) between November and December 2016.

The majority have been forced to move by one of the worst droughts in living memory gripping the Horn of Africa. In South Sudan famine has been declared, while in neighbouring Somalia and Yemen famine is a real possibility.

Despite being afflicted by the same climate and failing rains as neighbouring Somalia, the situation in Ethiopia’s Somali region isn’t as dire thanks to it remaining relatively secure and free of conflict.

But its drought is inexorably getting more serious. IOM’s most recent IDP numbers represent a doubling of displaced individuals and sites from an earlier survey conducted between September and October 2016.

Hence humanitarian workers in the region are increasingly concerned about overstretch, coupled with the lack of resources due to the world reeling from successive and protracted crises.

The blunt fallout from this is that currently not everyone can be helped – and whether you crossed an international border makes all the difference.

“When people cross borders, the world is more interested,” says Hamidu Jalleh, working for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Gode. “Especially if they are fleeing conflict, it is a far more captivating issue. But the issue of internally displaced persons doesn’t ignite the same attention.”

In January 2017 the Ethiopian government and humanitarian partners requested $948 million to help 5.6 million drought-affected people, mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the country.

Belated seasonal rains arrived at the start of April in some parts of the Somali region, bringing some relief in terms of access to water and pasture. But that’s scant consolation for displaced pastoralists who don’t have animals left to graze and water.

“Having lost most of their livestock, they have also spent out the money they had in reserve to try to keep their last few animals alive,” says Charlie Mason, humanitarian director at Save the Children Ethiopia. “For those who have lost everything, all they can now do is go to a government assistance site for food and water.”

Under the 1951 Refugee Convention, crossing a border entitles refugees to international protection, whereas IDPs remain the responsibility of national governments, often falling through the gaps as a result.

In the early 1990s, however, human rights advocates began pushing the issue of IDPs to rectify this mismatch. Nowadays IDPs are much more on the international humanitarian agenda.

But IDPs remain a sensitive topic, certainly for national governments, their existence testifying to the likes of internal conflict and crises.

“It’s only in the last year-and-a-half we’ve been able to start talking about IDPs,” says the director of a humanitarian agency covering Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “But the government is becoming more open about the reality – it knows it can’t ignore the issue.”

The Ethiopian government has far fewer qualms about discussing the estimated 8,00,000 refugees it hosts.

Ethiopia maintains an open-door policy to refugees in marked contrast to strategies of migrant reduction increasingly being adopted in the West.

Just outside Dolo Odo, a town at the Somali region’s southern extremity, a few kilometres away from where Ethiopia’s border intersects with Kenya and Somalia, are two enormous refugee camps each housing about 40,000 Somalis, lines of corrugated iron roofs glinting in the sun.

Life is far from easy. Refugees complain of headaches and itchy skin due to the pervading heat of 38 to 42 degrees celsius, and of a recent reduction in their monthly allowance of cereals and grains from 16 kg to 13.5 kg.

But, at the same time, they are guaranteed that ration, along with water, health and education services – none of which are available to IDPs in a settlement on the outskirts of Dolo Odo.

“We don’t oppose support for refugees – they should be helped as they face bigger problems,” says 70-year-old Abiyu Alsow. “But we are frustrated as we aren’t getting anything from the government or NGOs.”

Abiyu spoke amid a cluster of women, children and a few old men beside makeshift domed shelters fashioned out of sticks and fabric. Husbands were away either trying to source money from relatives, looking for daily labour in the town, or making charcoal for family use and to sell.

“I’ve never seen a drought like this in all my life – during previous droughts some animals would die, but not all of them,” says 80-year-old Abikar Mohammed.

As centres of government administration, commerce, and NGO activity, the likes of Gode and Dollo Ado and their residents appear to be weathering the drought relatively well. But as soon as you leave city limits you begin to spot the animal carcasses littering the landscape, and recognise the smell of carrion in the air.Livestock are the backbone of this region’s economy. Dryland specialists estimate that pastoralists in southern Ethiopia have lost in excess of 200 million dollars worth of cattle, sheep, goats, camels and equines. And the meat and milk from livestock are the life-support system of pastoralists.

“People were surviving from what they could forage to eat or sell but now there is nothing left,” says the anonymous director, who visited a settlement 70 km east of Dolo Odo where 650 displaced pastoralist families weren’t receiving aid.

The problem with this drought is the pastoralists aren’t the only ones to have spent out their reserves.

Last year the Ethiopian government spent an unprecedented 700 million dollars while the international community made up the rest of the 1.8 billion dollars needed to assist more than 10 million people affected by an El Niño-induced drought.

“Last year’s response by the government was pretty remarkable,” says Edward Brown, World Vision’s Ethiopia national director. “We dodged a bullet. But now the funding gaps are larger on both sides. The UN’s ability is constrained as it looks for big donors – you’ve already got the US talking of slashing foreign aid.”

Many within the humanitarian community praise Ethiopia’s handling of refugees. But concerns remain, especially when it comes to IDPs. It’s estimated there are more than 6,96,000 displaced individuals at 456 sites throughout Ethiopia, according to IOM.

“This country receives billions of dollars in aid, there is so much bilateral support but there is a huge disparity between aid to refugees and IDPs,” says the anonymous director. “How is that possible?”

Security in Ethiopia’s Somali region is one of the strictest in Ethiopia. As a result, the region is relatively safe and peaceful, despite insurgent threats along the border with Somalia.

But some rights organisations claim strict restrictions hamper international media and NGOs, making it difficult to accurately gauge the drought’s severity and resultant deaths, as well as constraining trade and movement, thereby exacerbating the crisis further.

Certainly, the majority of NGOs appear to exist in a state of perpetual anxiety about talking to media and being kicked out of the region.

While no one was willing to go on the record, some NGO workers talk of a disconnect between the federal government in the Ethiopian capital and the semi-autonomous regional government, and of the risks of people starving and mass casualties unless more resources are provided soon.

Already late, if as forecast the main spring rains prove sparse, livestock losses could easily double as rangeland resources – pasture and water – won’t regenerate to the required level to support livestock populations through to the short autumn rains.

Yet even if resources can be found to cover the current crisis, the increasingly pressing issue remains of how to build capacity and prepare for the future.

In the Somali region’s northern Siti zone, IDP camps from droughts in 2015 and 2016 are still full. It takes from seven to ten years for herders to rebuild flocks and herds where losses are more than 40%, according to research by the International Livestock Research Institute and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation.

“Humanitarian responses around the world are managing to get people through these massive crises to prevent loss of life,” Mason says. “But there’s not enough financial backing to get people back on their feet again.”

Brazilian Drought Brewing Ethiopian Coffee Resurgence|09/04/2014|"Lema Edito & Sons Coffee Producer & Exporter S.C owns a 128.5ha plot of land in Limu Genet in the Jima zone of Oromia, on which it cultivates coffee. The company has been in the coffee business since 2000, according to Wondessen Lema, its general manager. The share company harvests 10qt to 12qts of coffee a hectare once a year from its farm. In its 14 years of existence, the company has had its ups and downs triggered by various factors beyond the control of the company.

Bad weather and market slumps have left their marks on the history of the Company. But the past few weeks have brought nothing but good news for the coffee exporter. In the second week of March, the Company, which exports its products mainly to the European and American markets, was able to sign an agreement with a buyer from Europe to supply coffee in its stock, for a mouth-watering 3.2 dollars a pound (lb) – around 0.45kg.

“The buyer is an old customer and we signed the deal for the amount we have in stock,” Wondessen told Fortune.

Just a month and half earlier, a pound of exportable washed coffee was traded on the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) floor – the sole marketing venue for major coffee trading in the fifth biggest coffee producer in the world – for 1.15 dollars a pound. At the same time, at the end of January, a pound of coffee was sold for only 1.25 dollars on the New York Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) – the international price index.

The sudden surge in international coffee price, which began in mid February, was triggered by reports of drought in Brazil – the biggest producer of coffee Arabica, accounting for 29pc of the global coffee output.

Following the drought in the coffee producing belt of Brazil, the price of coffee in the futures market has shown an increment of 32.5pc in a matter of 20 days, according to the ICE. The export coffee market is a futures trade, where deals are made now for coffee shipments in months to come. Coffee, the second most sought after commodity, next to oil, has become a 100 billion dollar commodity, with 70pc of the global production being coffee Arabica.

This drought – which is being labelled as historic by the Brazilian media and has forced more than 140 cities in Brazil to ration water – has increased the price of not only coffee, but also sugar and soya bean. Brazil is the source of more than one-fifth of the world’s sugar output and about one-third of soybean production, according to the consulting firm Safras & Mercado.

Even before the drought began, there were concerns that there would be a global coffee deficit. At the beginning of the year, a closely-watched report by a commodities trading firm, Transworld Futures LLC, noted that the global coffee market could face a shortage for the first time in three years. The report predicted that coffee supplies will be about five million bags lower than consumption for the 2014/15 season.

The sudden price boom is not making everyone happy though.

Mormora Coffee Plantation signed a deal with its foreign partner for the supply of coffee before the start of the price surge – a benefit it will miss.

“We signed our agreement on June 6, 2013, for 2.4 dollars a pound, to supply for a year and we have to honour the agreement,” Hailesellasie Taddele, general manager of the company, told Fortune.

The plantation owns a 200ha coffee farm in Odo Shakiso, in Guji zone of the Oromia region.

But Hailesselasie believes some of his counterparts abroad would not have acted similarly under such situations.

“We have incurred huge losses in the past because of contractual breach,” Hailesselasie remembers. “There is no level ground for buyers and sellers, and the Ministry of Trade (MoT) is powerless to change this.”

He was recalling a deal he had two years ago with a customer in Panama.

Ethiopian exporters normally stick to their contract obligations, but the importers in the recipient countries may not respect their contract and refuse to open a Letter of Credit (LC), according to Wondessen. An exporter Wondessen knows in Limu Genet had to go through a similar ordeal when a buyer from Australia declined to make the purchase after signing an agreement when prices went down from 2.4 dollars to 1.7 dollars in 2013.

“We respect international trade laws and work to dismantle trade barriers for our exporters,” Amakele Yimam, public relation and communication head at the MoT, told Fortune.

Importers, especially those from the Middle East, are known for this kind of behaviour, according to an exporter who talked to Fortune on condition of anonymity.

Yet this is a rare incident, according to Yilma Gebrekidan, general manager of the Ethiopian Coffee Growers Association(EEA).

“Most of the importers that buy Ethiopian coffee are respected partners,” he said. “There are some dealers that want to take advantage of any gap in the market, yet these are very small in number.”

And such problems are better dealt with at the national level and through trade negotiations, rather than at the individual company level, says Seid Nuru, (PhD) Macroeconomic division head at the Ethiopian Economic Association.

“It all depends on the terms of trade and, with limited bargaining power, the terms may not be satisfactory for Ethiopian exporters,” he argued.

The Ministry is aware of the problem and hopes it will change in the future, as the country’s influence increases and with it its negotiation capacity, according to Amakele. But, for now, it has to settle for providing information to exporters.

The MoT, the governmental body designated to spearhead the growth in the export performance of the country and increase the size of foreign exchange that the country earns through trade – vital for financing major infrastructural projects in the country – has reported a dismal performance in its first six month report of the year.

The Ministry achieved only 65.49pc of its target of two billion dollars from the export sector in the first half of this fiscal year. The target for coffee during the same period was 333.2 million dollars, but the performance was only 222.5 million.

Following this result, the MoT has set up a command post to facilitate the achievement of the target export value, according to officials at the Ministry.

“We have enough product, but traders were not incentivised enough to bring their produce to the market,” Amakele said. “But now, the current price surge is expected to change the trend.”

The hopes of the ministry seems to be becoming reality, at least partially. Following the price increment, the volume of unwashed coffee traded on the ECX floor has increased by 500pc, in the last three months alone.

But the trend of volume sold in the normal washed and specialty coffee category does not show the same trend.

“There is always a lag witnessed in the increment on the volume of supply on such kind of products, due to the effects of prior contracts and the seasonal character of the product that takes time before the product is ready for market,” the macro economist explains.

An economy based on commodity exports, especially an agricultural export product is always volatile, according to Seid.

“Countries that depend on earnings from commodity exports, unless they are strategic minerals, will always stay at a disadvantage,” he said. “This has been clearly shown in the volatile coffee export of the country.”

Since there are limited barriers to entry, countries with no substantial background and technological base can become major competitors in the market in a relatively short period of time. Vietnam was able to take a prominent place in the international coffee market and Ethiopia did the same in the floricultural market, with limited experience very quickly.

Ethiopian exports of coffee, under the Harari and Abyssinian brands, started in the 1920s. Currently, up to twenty percent of the Ethiopian population, directly or indirectly, depends on coffee production and coffee trading for a living. The product earned close to 25pc of the foreign exchange that the country earned in 2012/13 and accounts for two percent of the country’s GDP, according to the ECEA.

The country’s coffee production has increased over the last five years from 230,000tns in 2008/09 to 400,000tns in the 2012/13 crop year, with an annual average growth rate of 11.3pc. Half of that is assumed to be consumed locally. And with the per capita consumption of 2.3kg, the country leads the continent in domestic consumption.

Though there is a marginal increment in the export of value added products like roasted and branded coffees, still it accounts for a very small portion of the total export, with nearly 70pc accounted for by sundried coffee and nearly 30pc by wet-processed (washed and semi-dried) coffee, according to the Association.

The government plans to increase the earning that the country gets from coffee to over two billion dollars by the end of the GTP and increase the volume of export to 800,000tns. It has managed to reach only around 1.1 billion dollars in the 2011/12 fiscal year – to date the biggest amount."|https://addisnews.net/brazilian-drought-brewing-ethiopian-coffee-resurgence/
Food crisis looming in Ethiopia after worst drought in 50 years|08/01/2016|"Tekle Birhan clutched her malnourished infant son as she waited to get a food supplement and treatment at an Ethiopian health clinic in early December. It was their third trip in as many months to the facility, located about an hour’s walk from her family farm that has seen almost no rain since July.

The worst drought in 50 years is eroding harvests of everything from corn to sorghum across Ethiopia, compounding a food shortage for a country where 30 percent of the population subsists on less than $1.25 a day. Already sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest wheat consumer, Ethiopia will need $1.1 billion to buy food for more than 18 million people this year, according to a report by the government and humanitarian partners including the United Nations.

“Because of the drought there is crop failure, so we don’t have any food,” Tekle, 30, said in an interview at a packed clinic in the Hintalo Wejerat district of the Tigray region. As her 18-month-old son nibbled on a cookie, Tekle said that the pulse, barley and wheat crops on her family farm got almost no moisture in July, and the normally wet month of August was dry.

Ethiopian droughts have become more frequent and severe in the past decade, and a lack of rain from El Nino weather patterns is fast becoming a problem in many parts of Africa. Zimbabwe, Zambia and South Africa have reported failed corn crops. Ethiopia, among the world’s poorest countries, will see the number of people that need food aid almost double this year. The nation has historically struggled with hunger, including in the 1980s, when famine and civil war left hundreds of thousands of people dead.

Ethiopia, which is the continent’s most-populous nation after Nigeria, is already buying more grain, purchasing 1 million metric tons of wheat in a tender announced in October. That’s about the same as it usually procures in an entire season. The country will need about another 500,000 tons in the next few months to replenish stockpiles, said Qaiser Khan, program leader for the nation at the World Bank, which is helping fund the grain purchases.

Farmers in Ethiopia usually harvest two grain crops a year, and problems started during the smaller “belg” season, when rains were about half the average from March to May. Erratic precipitation throughout the summer mean that the main “meher” harvest in most eastern areas also will be well-below average, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Famine Early Warning Systems Network. The country is normally Africa’s third-largest grain producer, after Nigeria and Egypt.

“It’s a really scary situation,” Mario Zappacosta, an economist at the U.N.’s Food amp; Agriculture Organization, said in an interview from Juba, South Sudan. “In part of the country, there were two bad seasons in a row.”

Ethiopia, with almost 97 million people, is just finishing up the harvest in some drought-hit areas, so shortages will probably be most severe from March or April, when stockpiles are depleted, Zappacosta said. Wheat imports into the nation will more than double to a record 2 million tons this season, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts.

Near the border of Ethiopia’s low-lying, arid Afar region, Abraha Haftu, 39, said he is facing a dry rainy season for a fourth year, and water shortages are adding to a lack of food supplies. Faced with crop failure, his family will once again have to count on the Productive Safety Net Program, an aid project run by the World Food Programme, he said.

“Water is very critical, as well as food,” he said, waiting in line at a government food-distribution warehouse in Hintalo Wejerat. “The government is trying, but some of the water sources are dry.”

Dried-out pastures have also killed off livestock, with 200,000 animals estimated to die in 2015 and an additional 450,000 this year, according to the U.N. That’s helping push up the food-import bill, putting more strain on the country’s already depleted foreign currency reserves, said Clare Allenson, an Africa-focused analyst at Eurasia Group, a Washington-based research and consulting firm.

“There’s already a lack of dollars available to the private sector,” Allenson said. “The livestock sector is really suffering, the same for milk and vegetables. This has led to major food-price inflation.”

Ethiopia has improved its defenses after previous famines. Better infrastructure, a growing economy, access to international aid and years of peace mean the country is more prepared to cope with crop failures than in the 1980s, FAO’s Zappacosta said.

The amount of international aid dollars available this year is likely to be stretched, with many crises cropping up around the world. The U.N. and humanitarian agencies released an appeal last month for a record $20.1 billion in funding, citing crisis situations in 27 countries.

“There are so many other emergencies in the world, and donors will have to decide where to put their money,” Zappacosta said. “There is some doubt that Ethiopia can pop up as a priority when you have Syria, South Sudan, Central African Republic and many other places in the world in bad situations.”

Drought takes terrible toll in Ethiopia – BBC Video|10/11/2015|"AddisNews – According to BBC the United Nations has warned that more than 15 million people in Ethiopia will be in need of food aid by the beginning of 2016 because of a severe drought.

BBC reporter Clive Myrie talk to residents affected by the current drought and compared it it the 1984 worst famine that puts the country in the map of the world as a symbol of famine and hunger.

A lack of rain has meant that crop yields in the worst-affected areas are down by 90% this year.

The Ethiopian government has set aside nearly £130m to deal with the crisis but the UN says a further £330m is needed.

Ethiopian children hit hard by worst drought in 30 years|25/01/2016|"An estimated 350,000 babies are expected to be born into Ethiopia’s worst drought in half a century over the next six months, campaigners warn today, amid calls for the United Nations to urgently raise the global alarm at a crisis gripping the African nation.

The drought will leave an estimated 10.1 million people in need of food aid, after two consecutive failed rains, the last one triggered by the El Niño which hit the globe last June. Save the Children has categorised the situation as the second worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world, behind only to Syria, with some 400,000 children suffering severe acute malnutrition as a result.

“The scale of the drought in Ethiopia is like nothing I’ve seen in the 19 years that I’ve lived in this country,” said Save the Children’s Ethiopia director, John Graham.

“This is a code red emergency, yet I have never seen such a small response to a drought of this magnitude from the UN or the international community.”

There is serious concern for the most vulnerable people – in particular newborns and their mothers.

At the Mender health centre in the northern Afar region, parents bring children suffering from hunger-related illnesses. Meron, 30, brought her one-year-old son to the centre after he began vomiting and wouldn’t eat.

“We had almost 100 goats before the drought, but now we have just five left,” she said. “We currently have no food, not even fruits. We have nothing.”

“Giving birth in a desperate situation where there are already serious food shortages and where livestock have died en mass, is extremely dangerous for both newborns and their mothers,” Mr Graham said. “There are an increasing number of pregnant and lactating mothers suffering from malnutrition.”

The drought has prompted fears of a repeat of the devastating famine in 1984, when nearly 1 million people died. Western governments were criticised at the time for ignoring warning signs during a drought three years earlier.

Since then, Ethiopia has seen significant economic gains and development and the government has allocated $300m (£210m) to deal with the crisis. But aid agencies say much more is needed. Only around a quarter of the $1.4bn required has been pledged, according to the UN.

Floods cause deaths and block food aid in drought-hit Ethiopia|26/04/2016|"



NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – Flash floods in drought-stricken parts of Ethiopia have killed people and livestock and are blocking food aid deliveries to hungry communities, a charity said.

Ethiopians have been waiting for the spring rains to replenish water sources and to plant crops after the most severe drought in decades pushed more than 10 million people into hunger.

But many livestock, weakened by the drought, have died following heavy rains in Ethiopia’s remote Somali and Afar regions, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said on Sunday.

“Not only are families losing their remaining livestock, but the heavy rain is making the roads inaccessible,” said Mohamed Hassan, who heads NRC’s work in the Somali region.

“Roads are turning into raging rivers and trucks carrying food assistance are unable to reach many communities.

“If people don’t get aid I am afraid that human lives might be lost,” he said in a statement.

Some 28 people were killed by flash floods in early April, the majority when a river passing through Jijiga, the capital of Somali region, burst its banks, the government said.

The two eastern regions, among the worst hit by the drought, are mainly home to herding communities. Cattle, sheep and goats often die after floods because infectious diseases increase and vegetation becomes toxic.

The government and aid agencies are revising upwards a joint appeal in December for $1.4 billion as the number of districts suffering a humanitarian emergency has widened.

The crisis is expected to deepen until August when people hope to harvest crops they will plant in June to catch the summer rains.

Floods can also contaminate water sources, causing diseases like cholera.

Ethiopia regularly suffers hunger crises as eight out of ten people are farmers who depend upon the rains.

“We will see this situation again and again,” said Hassan. “We must not only hand out food, but also help people find alternative livelihoods.”
