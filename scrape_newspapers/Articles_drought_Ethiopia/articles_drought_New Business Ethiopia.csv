UN food agency chiefs visit drought-hit Ethiopia|05/09/2017|"The heads of the United Nations food agencies made a joint call for greater investment in long-term activities that strengthen people’s resilience to drought and the impacts of climate shocks.

The officials made the statement at the conclusion of a four-day visit to Ethiopia, including to the drought-stricken Somali region. José Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and David Beasley, Executive Director of the World Food Programme (WFP), made their plea after they visited projects that treat dwindling herds to limit further livestock deaths and met drought-affected people receiving food rations.

“This drought has been going on for a long time and we have lost much of our livestock,” Hajiji Abdi, a community elder told them. “If we didn’t get food assistance, we would be in big trouble – but this is still not enough to feed us all.”

Back-to-back droughts have left at least 8.5 million people in Ethiopia in need of food aid. In the Somali region, rains have failed for the third consecutive year. The death of many livestock has caused a breakdown in pastoral livelihoods, contributing to soaring hunger levels and alarming increases in malnutrition rates. While the emergency response led by the Government has begun to stabilize the situation, additional resources are still urgently needed to prevent any further deterioration.







“It is essential to invest in preparedness and provide farmers and rural communities with knowledge and tools to safeguard themselves and their livelihoods. We’ve witnessed here that saving livelihoods means saving lives – it is people’s best defense against drought,” said Graziano da Silva, Director-General of FAO, the organization that is providing emergency livelihood support for drought-affected livestock owners and farmers, as well as support to stabilize communities’ long-term resilience.

“A drought does not need to become an emergency,” said Houngbo, President of IFAD, the agency that provides the government with loans, grants and technical expertise for rural development projects. “We know what works. In the Somali region, where there is investment in irrigation systems, water points, rural financial institutions, health and veterinary services and other long-term development projects, the communities can better sustain themselves and their livestock through this devastating drought. This is what we need to build on.”

“We have seen clearly here that working together the three UN food agencies can achieve much more than alone,” said Beasley, head of WFP, which is providing life-saving assistance to 3.3 million people in the Somali region, the epicentre of three years of drought.

“Of course we already collaborate, but now we will take these models and replicate them and scale them up across the world. We need to save lives while investing to support sustainable, resilient environment for communities across the globe so they prosper and succeed,” he added.

The impact of long-term development projects undertaken by the three food agencies was evident in the Tigray region, where agency heads saw irrigation schemes, fruit nurseries and health centres that are boosting productivity, increasing incomes and improving nutrition so that rural people can better withstand external shocks like droughts.

All three agencies are working closely with the Government of Ethiopia to eliminate hunger in the country. In meetings with Deputy Prime Minister, Demeke Mekonnen, and other high-level government representatives they discussed the need for greater collaboration and investment in resilience."|https://newbusinessethiopia.com/agribusiness/un-food-agency-chiefs-visit-drought-hit-ethiopia/
IBM researchers assist Kenya combat extreme drought conditions|30/08/2018|"IBM scientists in Kenya have unveiled a water management service platform (WMaaSP) to address the needs of approximately three million Kenyans living in the remote northern regions of the country.



The platform is part of the Kenya Resilient Arid Lands Partnership for Integrated Development (Kenya RAPID) under the coordination of the Millennium Water Alliance (MWA).







The IBM Cloud-hosted platform was developed in collaboration with various private and public sector partners, as well as representatives of the local governments in the northern counties of Kenya. The project was presented for the first time at the World Water Week conference in Stockholm, Sweden.

With a population of approximately 46 million, 41 percent of Kenyans rely on water sources such as ponds, shallow wells and rivers, a challenge especially in rural areas. Only nine out of 55 public water service providers in Kenya provide a continuous water supply.

Now, as part of the Kenya Resilient Arid Lands Partnership for Integrated Development (Kenya RAPID), IBM Research-Africa has created a water management platform to address the needs of these arid lands without access to safe water.

“The Kenya RAPID programme combines assets and experience of development actors, private and public institutions by leveraging their capital and investments, innovation and access to markets to address complex problems of inadequate water access, sanitation and poor governance of natural resources in the Arid and Semi- Arid Lands (ASAL) counties of Garissa, Isiolo, Marsabit, Turkana and Wajir in Kenya,” says Doris Kaberia Chief of Party for Kenya RAPID & Kenya Programs Director at Millennium Water Alliance.

The key product of IBM’s research is a software platform known as the Water Management as a Service Platform (WMaaSP), which provides decision support capabilities to county water officials and other partners.

The IBM Research-built platform can enable decision making by predicting water demand based on population trends, ground and surface water supply, climactic patterns and land use. This Water Management as a Service Platform (WMaaSP) is accessible on both web and mobile as an app.

The platform, which uses sensors to provide supply and demand patterns based on groundwater extraction data, can also help water service providers significantly reduce their non-revenue water (water that is “lost” before it reaches the customer through leaks, theft or metering inaccuracies).

“Through the support of IBM’s WMaaSP decision making tool, water service providers such as Londwar Water and Sewarage Company in Turkana or Dirib Gombo water scheme in Marsabit have significantly reduce their non-revenue water. For example, Dirib Gombo’s non-revenue water has reduced from over 40% to 30% and their revenues from Tarrif collection has also tripled ”, says Doris Kaberia, Chief of Party & Kenya Programs Director at Millennium Water Alliance.

The traditional approach to coping with water challenges, especially in water-scarce, arid environments has been to increase supply by investing unsustainably in decentralized water infrastructure (such as dams and boreholes) to meet growing domestic, agricultural and industrial demands.

Local governments and donor organizations typically finance expensive water infrastructures which are then handed over to communities with limited capacity to maintain them. Water managers also lack visibility into the location, status and performance of the water infrastructure, leading to an inability to respond to user feedback and a limited ability to provide repair and maintenance.

“For instance, if a citizen reports an issue to the sub-county water officer, the officer can use the mobile app to quickly locate the issue and assign the complaint to a repair officer who then inspects the issue and files a site report detailing the issue and/or required resources, also using the app. Once the repairs are complete, the assigned officer files a repair report detailing what was fixed to close the issue through the mobile app,” says Dr. Nathan Wangusi, the Principal Project Investigator from IBM Research – Africa.

SweetSense, a startup that works closely with IBM Research, is also installing sensors on electric water pumps to measure rates of utilization and infer levels of functionality to aid in the dispatching of crews for timely repair and maintenance for more efficient management of decentralized water infrastructure.

The platform can help water managers make decisions by predicting water demand based on population trends, ground and surface water supply, climactic patterns and land use. The platform also provides the following features:

• a database and interactive map for maintaining information about inventoried water points – or locations where water can be accessed throughout the counties.

• a historical record of water drawn from boreholes, breakages and repairs that are monitored by SweetSense.

• a view into the 3R and groundwater potential throughout the study region.

• a detailed view into water governance within each of the counties, associated responsibilities and contact information.

IBM has also established a Rotational Program with the counties which is focused on sharing software development skills with the county ICT representatives as these skills pertain to aspects of WMaaSP. The Program will allow the county representatives to work with IBM Research’s Engineering Team to learn first-hand how WMaaSP is designed and how it is being iteratively developed.

For more than seven decades, IBM Research has defined the future of information technology with more than 3,000 researchers in 12 labs located across six continents. Scientists from IBM Research have produced six Nobel Laureates, 10 U.S. National Medals of Technology, five U.S. National Medals of Science, six Turing Awards, 19 inductees in the National Academy of Sciences and 20 inductees into the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame.

Whether it’s data you possess, data outside your firewall, or data that’s coming, the IBM Cloud helps you protect it, move it, integrate it and unlock intelligence from it — giving you what it takes to prevail in a competitive market."|https://newbusinessethiopia.com/health/ibm-researchers-assist-kenya-combat-extreme-drought-conditions/
Saudi tycoon provides 55 trucks to drought affected in Ethiopia|20/04/2017|"Oromia receives Sheikh Mohammed Al-Amoudi’s 55 trucks of grain and 20 trucks of animal forage to support drought affected citizens in the Regional State.

The handing over of 55 heavy trucks of white maize and 20 heavy trucks of animal forage donated by Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Ali Al-Amoudi , Owner and Chairman of MIDROC Ethiopia, and his family to support drought affected citizens in three zones of the Oromia Regional State – Guji, Western Guji and Borena – held Tuesday – April 18, 2017.







The handing over held in Negele Borena town was attended by officials of the Regional State as well as from MIDROC Ethiopia, Traditional Chiefs and members of the local community.

During the handing over ceremony representative of Sheikh Mohammed, Esayas Kebede, indicated that the donation is part of the Ethiopians-for-Ethiopians effort to support drought affected citizens.

He also said that the transportation cost of 20,000 quintals of white maize and the 10,000 Belt (over 150,000 kg) ALFALFA animal forage was also fully covered by the Sheikh by deploying his own heavy trucks.

The representative also recalled that apart from hugely participating in investment activities and playing his own significant role in the country’s national income generation in terms of taxation and foreign currency earnings, Sheikh Mohammed has been making similar donations of grains from his agricultural firms during the previously occurred droughts in Ethiopia.

Head of Guji Zone Political Affairs Office Ato Tilahun Fikadu on his part pointed out that the volume of the donation made by Sheikh Mohammed H. Ali Al-Amoudi is the largest provided so far for the zone and indicated that various segments of the society are also doing their best to assist in the same effort.

Oromia Pastoralists Affairs Bureau Communication Head Ato Nasir Mohammed and the traditional chief also indicated that the donation made by Sheikh Mohammed is substantial and extended their appreciations to the Sheikh and his family.

In addition to providing emergency food donation, Sheikh Mohammed’s agricultural firms are relentlessly working to support local communities to ensure sustainable and modern agriculture and they are serving as centers of excellence for research and technology dissemination.

It is to be recalled that recently Sheikh Mohammed also made animal forage donation to farmers in the Guji Zone and a Birr 40 million cash donation to support victims of the Repi landslide tragedy occurred in Addis Ababa."|https://newbusinessethiopia.com/environment/saudi-tycoon-provides-55-trucks-to-drought-affected-in-ethiopia/
Were Egyptians hungry during frequent droughts in Ethiopia?|24/06/2020|"By Andualem Sisay Gessesse – In the past few years the tension between Ethiopia and Egypt has been escalating over the use of the water of the Nile River. Thought the reason for the dispute is said the Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which the country is set to start filling water this July, the issue is different.



Ethiopia proposed that it will fill GERD gradually without causing significant damage to water use of neighboring downstream countries – Sudan and Egypt. Ethiopia proposed that during the first year – this July rainy season -, to take 4.9 billion metric water and around 13 billion cubic water next year.







Meanwhile since the beginning of the construction of the dam, Egypt has been claiming that GERD will reduce the historical water volume from the Nile River (between 40 to 55 billion cubic meters of water). As July approaches, Egypt is currently trying everything that will force Ethiopia to ink a deal rather give assurance to Egypt that it will release at least 40 billion cubic meters of water annually from the River Nile.

Egypt, which is know as “the Gift of the Nile” argues that its people will starve and millions will be exiled to Europe if Ethiopia begins using the Nile River. But is Egypt’s claim true? To answer this it is good to know some basic facts.

Fact number 1 is to know the sources of the water of the Nile. Though around 15 percent of the water that flows into the the Nile River comes from other Nile Riparian countries mainly Uganda, Ethiopia contributes 86 percent of the water.

This 86% water is not coming from one river. It comes from tens of small water streams, which often almost dry or their water volume comes down by less than 50 percent during drought seasons.

Fact number 2 is that when these rivers dry in the absence of rain, Ethiopia, which relies in rain-fed agriculture was hit many times by severe droughts ,including the 1980s famine that claimed lives of millions of Ethiopian farmers.

But, during these drought periods in Ethiopia, which reduced the volume of the water flowing into the Nile River by more than half, Egyptians were not hungry.

Egypt somehow has managed to deal with the reduced reduced volume of water. If that is the case how come Egyptians become hungry today when Ethiopia begins filling about 5 billion metric cube water from the Nile? No! I will try to explain why at the end of this article. But will Ethiopia’s beginning to use the water reduce the current water volume of Egypt? Yes. Is there a solution? Yes many options. But before jumping into the solutions let’s first list out the major facts.

Fact number 3 is to know the final destination of the water of the Nile River. After leaving Ethiopia, the 86 percent of the water originated from Ethiopia, and the remaining from the other Nile riparian countries first arrives Sudan. In Sudan the water has been used for several purposes from irrigation, tourism to hydro-power and fisheries, among others.

Then the water of the River Nile directly goes to Egypt, where it has provided light to over 90 percent of the population, helping millions of farmers to grow rice and cotton, among others. In Egypt for centuries, the water of the Nile River has also been used for tourism, fishery and the like.







Fact number 4 is that Ethiopia’s beginning to use the water of the Nile River, which is its “natural right’, will indeed reduces Egypt’s current water volume coming from the River.

The about 5 billion cubic meters of water Ethiopia reduces from the Nile River to fill GERD this July and the total of 74 billion cubic meters, the country will take over the coming few years, will indeed affect Egypt’s current Nile River water use.

This is because of fact number 5, which is currently Egypt is using almost the whole water of the Nile River, leaving small amount to Sudan as per the colonial agreement the two countries / colonies inked in 1959 by ignoring the 86 percent water source of the water – Ethiopia.

The 1959 deal, which Ethiopia is not part of it, shares the water to Sudan and Egypt at 18.5 and 55.5 billion cubic meters, respectively. Egyptian politicians, who are now running from Arab League to the United Nations to stop Ethiopia from using its natural resource, are not worried about the about five billion water Ethiopia is using this rainy season for the GERD.

The Egyptian politicians are seeking a political pressure that will forces Ethiopia to ink a deal, which indirectly legalizes the unfair and immoral colonial agreement of the 1959.

But will Egyptian politicians political pressure on Ethiopia, whose 50 million population out of the total 110 million in darkness, succeed is the question for many.

In my view based on the above facts at least, Egyptian politicians effort, which at times mixed with lies or the attempt to threaten Ethiopia with military or sponsored cyber criminals will have a far negative impact on the people of Egypt.

All the current unwise moves of Egyptian politicians may force the government of Ethiopia to distribute water pumps to millions of its poor farmers to suck the water that flows into the Nile River and start small scale irrigation. That means, the current lies of Egyptian politicians that says, Egyptians will be hungry if Ethiopia fills GERD, will indeed be true.

As a verse of the Wholly Bible says. you eat the fruits of your tongue. Egyptian politicians wished hunger for their currently productive farmers instead collaborating with Ethiopia and Sudan to adapt with the water volume decline.

That means a few years later Ethiopia will be providing rice aid to hungry Egyptians. Even though I am an Ethiopian, I don’t wish that for Egyptian farmers. I believe punting myself in the shoes of those farmers. There are things the government of Egypt can do to balance the Nile water use of Ethiopia with use of the water by its farmers.

The first step for Egyptian politicians is to accept the above facts and the natural right of Ethiopia to use the water of the Nile River without causing significant harm to the downstream countries.

Once, the Egyptian politicians accepted the facts and acknowledge Ethiopia’s right to use the water reasonably, I am sure they can do adaptation actions like they did many times before when the water volume of the Nile River was declined during frequent droughts in Ethiopia. But most of all Egyptian politicians have to know that Ethiopians are tired of begging food aid from abroad while sitting on the Nile River, which can enable the country to feed its neighbors let alone its people.

As far as I know as a journalist, Ethiopia with its leadership, and the people who are contributing money from their pocket for GERD, are going to be unstoppable with current selfish attitude of Egyptian politicians.

Therefore, accepting these realities and taking some adaptation action is much better for Egyptian politicians than running up and down to keep millions of Ethiopian farmers in hunger, darkness and poverty.

Let me suggest the following five adaptation mechanisms Egyptian politicians can take to compensate the decline of the water from the Nile River when Ethiopia begins using.

Egypt can use the water going into the Mediterranean Sea. This will help Egypt to get billions of cubic meters of water that will compensate the water decline it will face when Ethiopia begins using the Nile water. Shift from water-intensive crops Rice and cotton farm to other less water consuming irrigation farming. It is clear that the water volume farmers need to grow rice and cotton is several times more than growing other crops. Helping Egyptian farmers to gradually shift or mix other less water consuming cash crops, can also compensate for Egypt the volume of water Ethiopia will be using from the Nile River. Cut evaporation from Nasser Dam. As we all know about ten billion cubic water is being evaporated from the Nasser Hydro dam of Egypt. By using technology, Egypt can also manage to reduce the volume of water that evaporates. This will help Egypt to secure billions of cubic meters of water that can also compensate the water Ethiopia will be using. Use some of its ground water, which can sustain the country for over a 1,000 year even without a drop of water from the Nile River. During the frequent drought seasons and even now, millions of Ethiopians are dependent on the use of ground water for drinking and cooking. Egypt, which has the potential of ground water that can last up to 1,000 years without even the water from the Nile River, can start using some of this potential to compensate the water decline when Ethiopia start using the water from the Nile River. Filter and use the sea water using the latest technology. While Ethiopia is land locked nation, Egypt which has access to the Mediterranean Sea can also get water using the latest technology that filters sea water. By the way, the Mediterranean Sea is also known for claiming lives of poor African youth including children of Ethiopian farmers, who try to cross to Europe escaping poverty.

As I indicated above, Egyptian politicians need to acknowledge that like Egyptian farmers need food, electricity, millions of Ethiopians also deserve the same right from the common gift of God to all the 11 Nile Riparian countries – Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt, Eritrea, Kenya, Rwanda, and South Sudan.







By the way Egyptian people and politicians should prepare themselves for the inevitable equitable and fair Nile River water share agreement among the 11 Nile Riparian Countries, which is now passed by parliaments of four countries. Egypt has prepare for the worst. If at least two more countries’ parliament approved that deal in their respective parliaments, the current 80 percent plus water share of Egypt will definitely go down to about 10 percent.

Rest assure, when these countries wake-up from their current deep sleep like Ethiopia, at least to feed their population using their potential and cut the billions of dollars they invest to import food, neither the Arab League nor the UN Security Council will hinder them from exercising their inherited natural right of equitably benefiting from this common gift – the Nile River."|https://newbusinessethiopia.com/nbe-blog/were-egyptians-hungry-during-frequent-droughts-in-ethiopia/
Nigeria, Somalia and Uganda set to improve drought resilience|21/11/2017|"A joint initiative of the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) is set to boost agriculture value chains and enhance drought resilience in Nigeria, Somalia and Uganda.

The initiative is part of a broad coalition to boost collaboration between the two institutions in agriculture, water and sanitation. The combined active portfolio of both institutions in these sectors in Nigeria, Somalia and Uganda is worth US$1 billion, with several projects in the pipelines to expand their support.

Stronger ties between AfDB and IsDB will help ramp up agricultural production along important crop and livestock value chains while preventing and mitigating climate change induced droughts will help achieve the objectives of “Say No To Famine/Alliance to End Famine in Africa.”

The investments are complemented with institutional capacity building to develop enabling environments for sustainable, green and inclusive growth. There is broad stakeholder agreement that collaborative and coordinated efforts are needed to swiftly deal with weather shocks that often have devastating consequences for the most vulnerable population.

“It is good to see this strong partnership between the African Development Bank and the Islamic Development Bank further evolving, in terms of depth, breath, resource commitments, leverage and speed of delivery“ says AfDB Vice-President for Regional Development, Integration and Business Delivery, Khaled Sherif.

VP Sherif recalled that the Presidents of the two institutions recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding that clearly outlines the way forward to strengthen the partnership.

“While the MOU is continent-wide and cross-sectoral, we jointly identified immediate synergies in the broader FEED Africa and Say No To Famine domain, which cover varying levels of short-term, medium-term and long-term interventions, to deliver even more efficiently and effectively to the benefit of communities in the three countries,” VP Sherif added.

IsDB Vice President, Mansur Muhtar stated: “Indeed, there is much to gain from the collaboration between our organizations. It is here that we can utilize our respective competitive advantages best and maximize the utilization of available resources.”

“This can be achieved in particular by avoiding duplication and concentrating the stipulated initiatives in support of our member countries in the identified sectors and areas that promise to be most impactful for local populations. We will also expand this partnership throughout the operationalization of upcoming initiatives by bringing in additional partners, especially the private sector,” VP Muhtar added.

For example, in Nigeria the Plateau State Potato Value Chain Support Project of the AfDB and the planned IsDB’s Agro Pastoral Development Project in Kano State will promote higher household incomes through productive agro-pastoral activities.

In Somalia, AfDB’s Say No To Famine project approved earlier this year is providing emergency assistance support and facilitating drought resilience building through the restoration of community assets which is complemented by IsDB’s ongoing Drylands Development Project.

Both at appraisal stages and a prime example of parallel co-financing, IsDB’s Irrigation Development Project and AfDB’s Agriculture Value Chain Development Programme showcase their commitment to help Ugandans benefit from the tremendous business opportunities that exist in agriculture, from the primary sector through manufacturing to agriculture produce-related services in collaboration with the government.

Discussions are also ongoing to scale up several projects, among them, the Strategic Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project in Uganda, which will be appraised later this year and presented to the AfDB Board of Directors for approval in early 2018."|https://newbusinessethiopia.com/environment/nigeria-somalia-and-uganda-set-to-improve-drought-resilience/
Japan assists drought affected Somalis in Ethiopia|06/04/2017|"To assist water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), nutrition and prevention of acute watery diarrhoea in drought affected Somali Region of Ethiopia; the Japanese government has provided $2 million.

The grant is given to the United Nations Childrens’ Fund (UNICEF), which is working in the region helping the children affected by the drought. The WASH sector will be taking the lion’s share with US$1,500,000 and the rest US$500,000 will be utilized by nutrition programme within an implementation period of six months.

This assistance is provided as a swift response to the joint call for support by Deputy Prime Minister Mr Demeke Mekonnen and United Nations Secretary-General Mr Antonio Guterres at UNECA on 29 January 2017 on the occasion of the High Level Forum on the humanitarian situation in Ethiopia.

The funding from the Japan Government aims to improve access to safe and reliable water to 115,000 women, men, boys and girls through drilling of new boreholes, rehabilitating non-functional water points and providing non-food items for distribution.

In addition, 9,000 children with severe acute malnutrition will receive adequate treatment and 31,488 mothers and caregivers will be trained on adequate infant and young child feeding practices during emergency.

The funding will also help prevent and control water-borne diseases, particularly the transmission of acute watery diarrhoea among affected and at-risk populations by securing access to safe water.

Ambassador of Japan to Ethiopia, Mr Shinichi Saida said, “We sincerely hope that Japan’s urgent humanitarian assistance for the drought response will reach the most vulnerable people as swiftly as possible and have a quick impact on the affected communities. Japan appreciates the WASH sector emergency response and its delivery promoted by Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Electricity in Ethiopia and UNICEF Ethiopia.”

“Children are extremely vulnerable in emergencies, often living in unhealthy and unsafe conditions and at high risk of contracting diseases,” said Ms Gillian Mellsop, UNICEF Representative to Ethiopia. “This contribution is a tangible demonstration of Japan’s commitment to safeguard children’s future and enhance resilience building of communities affected by the recurrent drought.”

Adding to an already dire situation, during the second half of 2016, a strong negative impact of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) led to below-average rainfall in different parts of Ethiopia including the Somali region. As a result, the water level declined significantly with seasonal rivers, springs and ponds drying up earlier than normal and increasing frequency of non-functionality of water supply schemes due to over utilization.

UNICEF is currently involved in operations across all the drought affected regions and contributes to the ongoing drought response effort through water trucking, rehabilitation of non-functional water supply schemes, building water storage capacity at critical and good yielding boreholes, provision of therapeutic food supplies, screening of children and pregnant and lactating women for malnutrition and monitoring for the provision of quality nutrition services.

UNICEF’s drought response activities are guided by its Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action, which prioritize timely response in key lifesaving sectors, namely nutrition, health, water, sanitation, and hygiene."|https://newbusinessethiopia.com/environment/japan-assists-drought-affected-somalis-ethiopia/
Germany assists drought affected people in Ethiopia|18/04/2017|"The Government of German provides 3.6 million Euros to support refugees, their host communities and drought affected people, German Embassy in Addis Ababa said.

The grant will be shared among three humanitarian projects in Ethiopia. The three projects aim at improving the living conditions of refugees from South Sudan in Ethiopia as well as those of Ethiopians living in drought affected areas, according to the statement.

One project is being implemented by OXFAM Germany. It will implement WASH measures (water, sanitation and hygiene) as well as nutrition, health and subsistence measures for South Sudanese refugees in the new Nguenyyiel Camp in Gambella. Nguenyyiel Camp, under the coordination of UNHCR, will receive a permanent water distribution system by producing drinkable water, which will be taken from the Baro River and benefit up to 60.000 persons. 333 private latrines will be built for two families each, equipped with solar lights, so that they can also be used safely at night. Additionally 333 wash- and bath facilities for two families each will be put, in addition to 1667 hand wash facilities. Furthermore, water committees will receive training about the proper use of the facilities to prevent diseases. The local Ethiopian population will be included in the activities of OXFAM and also benefit from the help for the refugees.

The second project is being conducted by HelpAge Germany. The overall objective is to improve the health situation and the conditions of life of elder refugees and refugees with disabilities in Gambella province. The following measures are planned, among others:

– Three Friendly Common Spaces for elderly people will be set up

– Trainings for 50 members of NGOs, UNHCR etc. for a better treatment of elderly people

– Public events and distribution of information leaflets for elder refugees

– 4200 other refugees will be trained to better understand and care for elderly persons in need

– 926 elderly persons get medical treatment including physiotherapy and prosthesis, if necessary

– 1500 elderly persons will get eye-treatment for improving their sight

– 270 elderly persons will get help in mobilization

– Business trainings, including financial help, for up to 80 elderly women

With the German Government´s financial support, Deutsche Welthungerhilfe will give emergency aid in supporting livestock and enhancing WASH infrastructure for the drought affected population in the regions of Dillo and Miyo of Oromia Province, the statement noted.

“These emergency measures shall support already ongoing projects in order to maintain and guarantee their success. The project includes sustainable provision of drinkable water for more than 4000 households. 1250 households will receive fodder and veterinarian treatment for the cattle,” it said.

“1300 households will participate in cash for work activities to construct 4 rain water catchments of 5000 m3 each and to rehabilitate 2170 hectares of land for agricultural use. 500 vulnerable households which cannot participate in cash for work activities like families with pregnant mothers or with children under the age of five years will get direct financial aid to survive until the end of the drought,” the Embassy added in its statement."|https://newbusinessethiopia.com/environment/germany-assists-drought-affected-people-ethiopia/
