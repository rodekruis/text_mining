EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

The  March,  2007  Rapid  Assessment  established  that  most  parts  of  Western,  North 
Western,  some  parts  of  Eastern,  Central  and  Northern  Provinces  experienced  severe 
flooding by second week of December 2006, resulting in damage to infrastructure, crop 
fields  and  disruption  in  service  delivery  as  well  as  reduction  in  the  grazing  land  for 
animals. This led the Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee (ZVAC) to conduct an 
In-depth Need and Vulnerability Assessment in order to determine the effects and extent 
of the floods and/or dry spells on infrastructure and habitations, health, nutrition, water 
and  sanitation,  education,  crops,  livestock  and  food  access  in  forty-five  (45)  districts. 
The findings from this assessment are the basis for interventions to mitigate the impact 
of the floods and/or dry spells. 

The In-depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment employed a combination of qualitative 
and  quantitative  approaches.  Within  the  quantitative  approach,  structured  household 
questionnaires  were  implemented.  A  complementary  qualitative  approach  relied  on  the 
Focus  Group  Discussions  as  well  as  District  Key  Informants.  Under  the  household 
questionnaire approach, a two (2) stage stratified sampling approach was used. A total 
of  630  Standard  Enumeration  Areas  (SEAs)  were  covered  bringing  the  total  of  12,000 
sampled households  in  the  forty-five (45) districts of the nine  (9) Provinces. Under the 
qualitative  approach,  a  total  of  180  Community  Focus  Group  Discussions  (CFGDs)  and 
forty-five (45) District Key Informant interviews were undertaken. 

Furthermore, anthropometric data collection methods were also employed for collection 
of nutrition data for the under-five children a total of 6,240 children were sampled. The 
field  data  collection  took  28  days  and  was  carried  out  by  thirteen  (13)  teams  of  VAC 
enumerators. 

Although 20  SEAs were selected  for  each district, the teams collected  information from 
at  least  14  SEAs  due  to  time  constraints.  The  14  SEAs  were  selected  purposively 
depending on the flood/dry spell status. However, caution was taken to ensure that the 
selected SEAs were well spread out to ensure maximum variability.  

Major findings 

•  Despite  varying  rainfall  intensities  experienced  in  most  districts,  the  2006/07 
production  was  above  average.  However,  in  some  of  the  assessed  districts, 
production of main staples at household level marginally reduced. 

•  About  fourteen  (14)  districts  of  Luapula,  Northern,  Western  and  North-Western 
Provinces  were  found  have  serious  food  access  problems  amongst  most 
households  that  had  a  production  gap  of  –70%  from  the  2006/07  production 
season.    Furthermore,  a  total  population  of  440,866  persons  in  these  districts 
were found to be food insecure and would require 31,742 tons of maize for the 
period  of  six  (6)  months  starting  in  September,  2007.  This  relief  should  be 
labour  based  in  nature  (80%)  and  the  remaining  20%  will  be  general  food 
distribution for the chronically vulnerable who were affected by floods such as the 
aged, disabled and not able to work and child headed households. It is also worth 
noting  that  the  assessment  did  not  look  at  the  chronic  versus  transitory 
vulnerability dynamics due to lack of baseline information. 

•  Major  income  sources,  expenditure  patterns  and  coping  strategies  employed 
generally remained the same compared to the previous season with most of them 
engaging  in  casual  labour,  sale  of  crops  and  petty  trading  as  the  three  most 
common activities 

•  A total of thirteen (13) districts have been placed under monitoring to evaluate 
the evolution of their food security situation among households whose production 
gap was less more than -70 but current response options were fairly sufficient to 
sustain bridge up the production gap.  

•  Maize  prices  in  visited  districts  have  remained  relatively  low  and  below  the  five 
year  average  in  most  districts  while  livestock  prices  have  also  recorded  an 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

viii 

increase  in  almost  all  the  assessed  districts.  These  prices  when  compared  to 
those  that  prevailed  during  the  lean  period  are  higher,  indicating  that  most 
households are not under food stress. 

•  The  overall  prevalence  of  global  acute  malnutrition  (GAM)  and  severe  acute  malnutrition 
(SAM) of the sampled population, using the weighted mean from all the 45 districts was 5.6% 
(1.09  -  1.62  CI)  and  2%  (1.35  -  1.84  CI)  respectively.  The  analysis  further  indicates  that 
children aged between 6- 41 months were more wasted than the older children. 

 

•  Global stunting from the assessed children stands at 34.2% ( 0.75 – 1.29 CI) while 20.3% ( 
0.31 - 1.82CI)20.3% were severely stunted. The prevalence of severe underweight was more 
(34.7%)  among  children  aged  between  18–29  months  while  there  was  no  significant 
difference in moderate underweight in almost all the age groups. The Global underweight rate 
of  18%  and  severe  underweight  rate  of  11.6%  was  found  among  all  the  children  in  the 
assessed districts.   
 

• 
•  Generally,  common  childhood  illness  were  high  among  under-five  children  two 
weeks prior to the assessment. Malaria (41%) was the most common household 
illness  with  23  %  reporting  cough  problems  while    fever  and  diarrhoea  cases 
affected  11%.    About  16%  of  the  visited  households  reported  at  least    a 
chronically ill adult member. 
 

• 
•  Despite  the  country  having  the  high  breastfeeding  rate  of  98%,  only  40%  of 

infants are exclusively breastfed.  
 

• 
•  Overall 

the  survey  established  an 

impressive  coverage  of  vitamin  A 
supplementation  (82%)  which  is  above  the  80%  threshold  from  bi-annual  child 
health week campaigns. The immunization coverage among eligible children was 
also  high  considering  that  the  assessment  was  conducted  before  the  campaign.  
Ninety (90%) of children had received BCG at birth, 86% had received DPT, Polio 
82% and measles 73% had received the vaccines.  
 

• 
•  Despite  most  households  having poor  access  to  poor safe water  only  23%  were 
treating  water  most  households  (75%)  reporting  diarrhoea  cases  did  not  treat 
water. There was high diarrohea case among households using borehole water as 
well as those using traditional latrines implying generally poor hygiene standards 
at household level. 
Infrastructure  (Roads,  bridges/culverts)  was  found  to  be  the  most  severely 
affected.  

• 

 CONCLUSIONS 

The  impact  of  floods  and/or  prolonged  dry  spells  on  crop  production  and  livestock 
was low as established in the March 2007 rapid flood assessment however fourteen 
(14)  districts  have  experienced  drastic  reduction  in  the  overall  harvest  of  main 
staples as a result of water logging and flash floods. 

The nutritional situation of children found in this survey is best described as 
“stable but precarious”, with a high likelihood of deterioration if interventions 
and/or if basic services, particularly provision of clean water and health care, 
are reduced.  
 

Access  to  safe  water  and  good  sanitation  in  rural  households  has  remained  poor 
while hygiene standards are very low.

 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

ix 

Food Security  
 

  Fourteen (14) districts would require 31,742MT of cereals targeting a population 
of  440,866  for  six  months  starting  from  September  2007  to  February  2008. 
Programming  options  should  include  food  for  work  (80%),  free  food  (20%). 
Moreover  there  is  need  for  redistribution  of  the  staple  food  from  surplus  areas 
within and outside the district to non surplus areas through the markets a source 
of income for surplus producing households 

  Enhanced  farmer  sensitisation  through  crop  and  livestock  extension  services 
which should  include  appropriate  Dambo  utilization  interventions,  good livestock 
husbandry practices and livestock disease surveillance system. 

  Support for small scale irrigation systems to targeted rural population with access 
to  streams  and  dambos  to  improve  on  their  productivity  in  vegetable  gardening 
as well as other winter crops like maize.  

  There is need for crop diversification and promotion of growing and consumption 
of  cassava,  sorghum,  millet  in  areas  that  predominantly  grow  maize  especially 
low  producing  areas.  In  addition,  the  non  cereal  crops  such  as  cowpeas  should 
also be considered. 

 
 

Nutrition 

            

 

  Programmes  aiming  to  reduce  and/or  prevent  malnutrition  must  focus  on 
increasing  access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation,  and  reducing  disease  incidence, 
particularly Fever/malaria, respiratory infections and diarrhoea. 
 Health and hygiene promotion should be strengthened to include all populations, 
supported  by  provision  of  appropriate  non-food  items  such  as  water,  mosquito 
nets, Chlorine etc where necessary. 
 Food  assistance  also  plays  a  vital  role  in  ensuring  good  health  and  nutrition 
status, and should be continued for those who are unable to provide adequately 
for themselves. 

 

  Nutrition  programmes  should  focus  mostly  on  children  under  the  age  of  three 

 

 

years, since this is where the majority of acute malnutrition is found. 
 Routine  immunizations and supplementation of vitamin  A for all children should 
be  strengthened,  and  health  clinics  supported  to  provide  these  vital  services. 
Campaigns to maintain high levels of measles and polio immunization are also a 
necessary strategy. 
 Outreach  and  early  case  finding  of  malnourished  children  in  the  communities 
should  be  strengthened  where  possible,  to  improve  coverage  of  therapeutic 
feeding programmes. 

  Supplementary  feeding  programmes  should  focus  more  on  education  for 
caretakers,  and  be  used  as  an  opportunity  to  raise  awareness  of  appropriate 
health, hygiene and caring practices, rather than simply a distribution of food 

  Routine surveillance activities should be strengthened to allow early detection of 
changes in nutrition and health status, and to remove the need for large surveys 
such  as  this.  Such  surveillance  systems  should  be  integrated  into  government 
structures and include food security monitoring I ndicators as well. 

 

Health 

  Intensify  information,  education  and  communication  to  mitigate  any  possible 

outbreak of communicable diseases 

  Continue  monitoring  of  disease  patterns  as  some  effects  can  appear  after  the 

floods. 

  Support the provision and distribution of essential drugs and supplies for malaria, 

diarrhoea and coughs/ARI through programmes  

  Scaling  up  of  programmes  such  as  Roll  Back  Malaria  and  Domestic  Water 

Chlorination Promotion in all districts. 

  Support  sustained  delivery  of  essential  health  services  such  as  immunization, 
child  growth  monitoring,  maternity,  HIV/AIDS,  TB  including  through  outreach 
where appropriate. 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

x 

  Support integrated disease surveillance and reporting (IDSR), especially measles 

and other common illnesses. 

  Intensification  of  community  sensitization  on  good  hygiene  practice  e.g.  waste 

disposal. 

  Primary  health  indicators  generated  by  HMIS  should  be  overlayed  with 

environmental  predictors  such  as  temperature,  rainfall  etc  in  order  to  provide  a 

comprehensive  secondary  analysis  that  could  be  used  for  epidermic  forecasting 

and preparedness at district level. 

 

 

 
Water and Sanitation 
Water 

 

  Intensify community sensitisation and participation in water programmes such as 

treatment and protection of water sources through D-WASHE programmes 

  Increase availability and affordability of chlorine (as chlorin) in collaboration with 

MoH under the Domestic Water Chlorination Promotion. 

  Increase  access  to  safe  drinking  water  by  constructing  water  facilities  such  as 
boreholes  and  dams  especially  in  areas  with  poor  access  to  safe  water  such  as

1.0 INTRODUCTION 

1.1  Background and Rationale 

During  the  2006/07  rainy  season,  Zambia  experienced  varying  rainfall  intensities.  Most 

parts  of  the  country  experienced  high  rainfall  that  was  characterized  by  flooding  while 

extreme  southern  parts  of  Western  and  Southern  Provinces  experienced  prolonged  dry 

spells.  This  was  established  during  the  Rapid  Flood  Assessment  in  March  2007.  Most 

parts of Western, North Western, some parts of Eastern, Central and Northern Provinces 

experienced severe flooding by second week of December 2006. This resulted in damage 

to infrastructure, crop fields and disruption in service delivery as well as reduction in the 

grazing land for animals.  

The  Rapid  Assessment  also  established  that  the  impact  was  cross  cutting  and  mostly 

affected  infrastructure.  The  risk  of  water  borne  disease  outbreak  was  also  found  to  be 

very  high.  Reports  of  adverse  impact  of  the  prolonged  dry  spells  on  crops  in  southern 

Zambia were also received from affected districts. 

In view of these varying impacts of floods and prolonged dry spells on different sectors 

and  the  inability  to  access  some  affected  areas  at  the  time  of  the  survey,  the  Zambia 

Vulnerability Assessment Committee (ZVAC) conducted an in-depth assessment aimed at 

determining  the  effects  and  extent  of  the  floods  on  infrastructure  and  habitations, 

health,  water  and  sanitation,  education,  crops,  livestock  and  food  access  in  forty-five 

(45) districts.  

1.2  Objectives of the In-depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment  

The  overall objective of the assessment was to determine the  effects and  extent of the 

floods  and/or  prolonged  dry  spells  on,  food  access,  crops  and  livestock,  water  and 

sanitation, health, education, infrastructure and habitations, in forty-five (45) districts. 

1.2.1  Specific Objectives 

The specific objectives were to: 

  Assess the impact of floods and/or prolonged dry spells on the 2006/07 crop and 

livestock production 

  Determine the impact of varied rainfall on WATSAN, Education and infrastructure 

  Determine the impact of varied rainfall on markets 

  Identify worst affected areas as well as the population affected. 

  Determine food and non-food needs if any 

  Determine  the  effects  of  varied  rainfall  on  health  and  nutrition  status  of  under-

five children in the affected areas. 

  Determine the communities’ preparedness to hazards

Scope of the In-depth vulnerability and needs assessment 

The floods and prolonged dry spells affected people in forty five (45) districts. The floods 

affected  all  sectors  of  the  economy.  These  include  health,  water  and  sanitation, 

education,  infrastructure  and  habitations,  and  agriculture.    In  order  to  ascertain  the 

extent to which people were affected, the survey employed three approaches that is, the 

household questionnaire approach, key informant interviews and focus group discussions 

at district and community levels.  

The household questionnaire covered the following topics: -  

•  Household demographics 

•  Productive asset ownership 

•  Household food security 

•  Agricultural inputs 

•  Health, water and sanitation 

•  Child nutrition 

•  Food consumption strategies 

• 

Income and Expenditure strategies 

The key informant and focus group discussions at district and community levels covered 

the following topics: 

•  Rainfall patterns and its effects 

•  Food security programmes  

•  Livelihood sources 

•  Food crop and livestock availability 

• 

Income source 

•  Health and nutrition 

• 

Infrastructure and habitations 

•  Water and sanitation.  

1.4 Methods and Procedures 

1.4.1 Sampling Frame 

Zambia  is  administratively,  divided  into  nine  provinces.  Each  province  is  in  turn 

subdivided  into  districts.  Each  district  is  further  subdivided  into  constituencies  and 

wards.  For  statistical  purposes  each  ward  is  subdivided  into  Census  Supervisory  Areas 

(CSAs)  and  these  are  in  turn  subdivided  into  Standard  Enumeration  Areas  (SEAs).  The 

1998-2000  mapping  exercise  in  preparation  for  the  2000  census  of  population  and 

housing,  demarcated  the  CSAs  within  in  wards,  wards  within  constituencies  and 

constituencies  within  districts.  In  total,  Zambia  has  72  districts,  150  constituencies, 

1,289 wards. Wards are further divided into Census Supervisory Areas (CSAs), which are 

in turn divided into Standard Enumeration Areas (SEAs). The SEAs are also stratified by 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

2 

urban and rural strata. The listing of SEAs has information on number of households and 

the population. However, for the purposes of this survey, SEAs constituted the ultimate 

Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). Therefore, the sample frame for this survey is the list of 

SEAs developed from the 2000 Population Census.  

 

1.4.2 Sample Stratification and allocation  

In order to have estimates at district level, as well as equal precision in the estimates in 

the  selected  districts,  the  Equal  Sample  Allocation  Method  (ESAM),  based  on  the 

established  minimum  samples  for  a  district,  has  been  adopted.  In  view  of  that,  each 

selected  district  had  a  sample  of  20  SEAs  /PSU’s.  In  addition,  the  SEAs/PSUs  were 

further stratified by flood and prolonged dry spell status for purposes of this survey.  In 

the  district  that  were  affected  by  floods,  allocation  of  the  20  PSUs  was  done  using 

proportional  allocation  i.e.  how  many  flood  and  non  flood  affected  areas  were  to  be 

covered  within  a  district.  The  allocation  of  sample  points  in  the  flood  and  non  flood 

strata,  and  the  dry  spell  areas  was  proportional  to  there  estimated  size  within  these 

strata.  

 

1.4.3 Sample Selection 

The In-depth vulnerability and needs assessment employed a two-stage stratified cluster 

sample  design.  In  the  first  stage,  20  SEAs  were  selected  from  each  of  the  45  targeted 

districts.  Due  to  time  constraints  only  70%  of  the  selected  areas  (14  SEAs)  were 

canvassed the field teams. 

 

1.4.4 First Stage Selection  

At  the  first  sampling  stage,  the  sampled  SEAs  were  selected  within  each  stratum 

(affected  and  non  affected  areas  within  district,  and  prolonged  dry  spell  areas) 

systematically with probability to estimated size (PPES) from the ordered list of SEAs in 

the In-depth vulnerability sampling frame. The measure of size for each SEA was based 

on  the  population  size  identified  in  the  2000  Census.  The  sorting  of  the  frame  of  SEAs 

within  each  district  provided  further  implicit  stratification  by  the  specified  criteria.  The 

following first stage sample selection procedures were used:  

 

(1)  Sort  the  SEAs  within  each  district  stratum  (flood,  non  flood  and  prolonged  dry 

spell  area)  by  the  following  codes:  region  (rural/urban),  Status,  constituency, 

ward, CSA and SEA. 

(2) Cumulate the measures of size (population) down the ordered list of SEAs within 

strata.  The  final  cumulated  measure  of  size  will  be  the  total  population  in  the 

frame for the strata in the district (Mds). 

(3)  To  obtain  the  sampling  interval  for  district  stratum  ds  (Ids),  divide  Mds  by  the 

total number of SEAs to be selected in district stratum ds (nds): 

 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007

Ids= Mds/nds  

 

The Excel software was used for selecting the sample of the initial 900 sample SEAs for 

the  In-depth  Vulnerability  Assessment  survey  following  these  procedures, based  on  the 

allocation  of  the  sample  SEAs  described  Sample  Stratification  and  allocation  section 

above. Separate  excel  files per province were used showing the ordered  frame  of  SEAs 

with  the  corresponding  2000  Zambia  Census  information.  It  documents  the  first  stage 

systematic  selection  of  sample  SEAs  with  PPS  for  each  district  stratum  within  the 

province for the selected districts.  The selected areas were arranged in a separate excel 

file used to calculate the weights for each selected HHLD in a district stratum.  

 

1.4.5 Second Stage Selection 

The second stage of the sampling procedure involved the selection of households in the 

SEAs selected at the first stage. Due to time and resource limitations, listing to get the 

updated  number  of  households  was  not  done.  For  the  purposes  of  this  survey  the 

measure  of  size  (NSEA)  for  the  PSUs  was assumed to be  that  in  Census  2000  frame.  In 

each SEA 20 households (nSEA) were selected. The sampling interval k was calculated as 

follows: 

 

 

k= (NSEA)/ (nSEA). 

Every  k-th  household  in  the  selected  area  was  canvassed  until  all  the  required  20 

households were covered. 

 

1.4.6 Weighting Procedure 

In order for the sample estimates from any particular survey to be representative of the 

population,  it  is  necessary  to  multiply  the  data  by  a  sampling  weight,  or  expansion 

factor. The basic weight for each sample household would be equal to the inverse of its 

probability  of  selection  (calculated  by  multiplying  the  probabilities  at  each  sampling 

stage). 

 

Based  on  the  sample  design  for  the  In-depth  Vulnerability  Survey,  the  probability  of 

selection  within  each  SEA  is  different  for  the  households  depending  on  which  strata  it 

was sampled  from  i.e.  flood,  non  flood and  dry  spell  areas.  The  probability  of  selection 

for  sample  households  in  each  stratum  within  a  selected  district  can  be  generalized  as 

follows:

Were: 

pdsi  =  probability  of  selection  for  the  sample  households  in    within  the  i-th 

sample SEA in district stratum ds 

mds= number of sample SEAs selected in district stratum ds. 

Ndsi  =  total  number  of  households  in  the  frame  for  the  i-th  sample  SEA  in 

district stratum ds. 

Nds = total number of households in the frame for district stratum ds. 

ndsi = number of sample households selected in Category s from the listing for 

the i-th sample SEA in district h 

 

The two terms in pdsi correspond to the first and second stage probabilities of selection; 

at the first stage the SEAs were selected with probability proportional to size PPS, and at 

the  second  stage  the  households  were  selected  with  estimated  equal  probability  within 

each SEA. 

 

The  basic  sampling  weight  is  equal  to  the  inverse  of  the  probability  of  selection. 

Therefore  the  corresponding  basic  weight  for  the  sample  households  in  stratification 

status in each district would be calculated as follows: 

wdsi

wdsi  =  the  basic  weight  for  the  sample  household  selected  within  the  i-th  sample

The first and second parts of the equation represents the weights for  the two stages of 

selection i.e. first stage weight and second stage weight, respectively. The excel file with 

the selected areas was  used to calculate these weights. Since  listing  was not done, the 

basic weights  for  this  survey  represent  the situation  as at 2000.  So  the  weights  had to 

be  adjusted  so  as  to  account  for  population  growth  to  represent  the  situation  for  the 

survey  period  June  2007.  Post  stratification  adjustment  to  the  weights  was  done  using 

the racking method as follow:

Dpdata=initial weighted district population using survey data. 

 

The  factor  Dp2007  over  Dpdata  can  be  considered  as  the  growth  rate  for  the  district.  The 

final  weights  were  there  was  to  calculate  survey  estimates  using  SPSS  and  STATA 

software.  STATA  was also used  to  calculate  variance  estimation using  the  Taylor  Series 

method in build in the software taking in account the complex survey design.     

 

1.4.7 Sampling for Nutrition 

1.4.7.1 Sample size and sampling process for the household survey 

Sample  size  estimates  were  made  to  ensure  that  key  nutrition  indicators  would  be 

statistically representative at the  individual and/or  overall population  level.  Sample size 

was  calculated  with  0.05  statistical  significance  (95%  confidence  interval-CI),  for  key 

nutrition indicators. Based on the national and NGO nutrition surveys, assumptions were 

made that each household would  have an average of one child aged 6 to 59 months, a 

household  size  of  six  members  and  one  mother.  Prevalence  estimates  were  based  on 

previous  surveys  carried  out  by  various  Government  departments  and  other  agencies 

national  wide.  Because  of  the  two-stage  sampling  technique  that  was  used,  it  was 

necessary to increase the sample size by a factor that would allow for the design effect, 

which  were  estimated  using  the  rapid  nutrition  Survey  2005  and  the  targeted  nutrition 

assessment  2006  conducted,  by  GRZ,  UNICEF  and  WFP  in  drought  affected  districts  in 

Zambia.  The  desired  precision  was  based  on  the  estimated  prevalence,  as  well  as 

consideration of relevant cut offs for programmatic action. 

 

The  primary  objectives  of  integrating  the  nutrition  component  in  this  survey  was  to 

determine  the  nutritional  status  of  populations  which  were  affected  by  floods  and/or 

prolonged dry spells, proxied by children aged between 6-59 months. 

 

1.4.7.2 Anthropometric measurement 

Survey workers measured children’s weight, height/length, and assessed the presence of 

bilateral oedema. Children were weighed to the nearest 100 grams using a digital SECA 

scale. For children younger than 2 years of age or less than 85 centimeters (cm), length 

was  measured  to  the  nearest  millimeter  in  the  recumbent  position  using  a  standard 

height board. Children 85 to 110 cm were measured in a standing position. Oedema was 

assessed by applying thumb pressure to the feet for approximately 3 seconds and then 

examining for the presence of a shallow print or pit.

1.4.8  Analytical Approach 

1.4.8.1 Estimating food production in maize equivalent 

In order to estimate the food production in maize equivalent for the 2006/07-production 

season,  each  of  the  main  cereals  and/or  tubers  (main  staples)  needed  to  be  converted 

into one common unit. In this regard, maize was used as a common unit as a result of it 

being the widely consumed staple crop. Furthermore, before performing any calculations 

involving  aggregating  across  the  different  crops,  each  of  the  main  cereals  (other  than 

maize) and/or tubers was converted to maize calorie equivalents as a common unit. To 

obtain  quantities  of  crops  in  maize  calorie  equivalents,  the  quantity  of  the  crop  was 

multiplied by the ratio of its unit calorie content to maize unit calorie content;

The calorie contents of various crop commodities were obtained from FAO (1997). With 

2005/06  crop  production  regarded  as  normal  (surplus)  the  drop  in  mean  cereal 

production  was  calculated  as  the  difference  per  household  between  cereal  production 

during  the  2006/07  marketing  season  and  quantity  produced  and/  or  expected  to  be 

produced at the beginning of the 2007/08 marketing season. The latter was computed as 

the  sum  of  production  and  carry  over  stocks  as  of  June  2007,  when  the  survey  was 

conducted. 

1.4.8.2 Identifying desperate areas and persons affected 

Using  the  2005/06  household  production  data  as  a  baseline  (surplus  year),  all  districts 

were  first  classified  using  a  process  that  determined  the  production  gap  by  comparing 

the current year’s production (2006/07) with the base  year  (2005/06).  All districts that 

had  a  gap  less  than  or  equal  to  -39%  were  eliminated.  The  assumption  is  that  their 

range of response options that includes a variety and number of livestock owned by such 

households  which  could  be  disposed  is  enough  to  help  bridge  up  the  gap  through 

different  means  which  are  quite  sustainable.  Districts  whose  production  gap  was 

between -40%-69% and their range of response options are unsustainable i.e. skipping 

meals,  over  reliance  on  consumption  of  vegetables,  working  too  long  in  other  people’s 

fields, were placed under monitoring so as to observe the evolution of the food security 

situation as the  lean period draws near. It is worth noting that these  districts go  either 

way  (severe  or  better)  determining  on  the  households  ability  to  employ  sustainable 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

7 

coping mechanism. All the districts where most households experienced a production gap 

of  -70%  from  the  base  year  (2006/07  season)  and  their  response  options  such  as 

skipping  meals,  over  reliance  on  consumption  of  vegetables,  working  too  long  in  other 

people’s  fields  were  not  enough  to  bridge  up  the  food  gap  were  classified  as  severely 

needy areas. The assumption is that as the season moves towards the  lean period, the 

response options will not be sustainable. 

The severity scale was estimated as the percentage gap of maize equivalent in a district 

as shown in the formula below:

Quantity of Cereal 

 

 

Produced (MT) -06 

The  number  of  the  affected  persons  in  need  of  the  food  interventions  was  derived  by 
averaging  the  percentage  of  the  persons  affected  in  wards  covered  during  the  rapid 
floods  assessment  by  district,  as  well  as  percentage  estimates  on  the  affected  derived 
through  proportional  pilling  approach  from  the  community  interviews  conducted.  This 
was  validated  by  the  district  %  of  the  HHLDs  in  the  total  sample  (12,000  HHLDS)  that 
reported having produced less than or equal to100kg in 2007. Of course the other issue 
taken  into  consideration  for  such  HHLDS  is  the  assets  owned  and  other  livelihood 
activities being done to complement the production.  

1.4.8.3 Determination of cereal requirements for the affected  population 

in food insecure District 

The assessment used the following formula to determine the amount of cereal required by those 

affected: 

 

 

 
MAIZE REQUIREMENT1 = STANDARD RATION2 X # OF MONTHS3 X # AFFECTED PEOPLE  

                                                                      1000

1.4.8.4 Assessing under five nutrition status 

The anthropometrical status of young children aged between 6-59 months was taken to 

reflect  the  nutritional  status  of  the  populations  which  were  affected  by  floods  and 

prolonged dry spells.  

This was done within the wider socio-economic and public health context for intervention 

recommendation 

in  the  broader  perspective.  This 

implies  that 

in  addition  to 

anthropometrical  data,  the  underlying  causes  of  malnutrition  and  the  health  risks 

associated with malnutrition were assessed. 

Severity  of  the  nutritional  situation  was  assessed  by  taking  weight  and  height 

measurements of all eligible children in the surveyed households.  In addition to weight 

and  height  measurements;  sex,  age,  pitting  bilateral  oedema  and  immunization  status 

was  collected  for  each  child.  Anthropometrical  data  provided  an  estimate  of  the 

prevalence  of  malnutrition  at  household  level  while  normal  seasonal  patterns  of 

malnutrition, food security and disease helped to determine whether this prevalence was 

flood/dry spell related or was a normal pattern.  

 

To help identify appropriate intervention responses, the ZVAC used an adapted version of 

the  UNICEF  conceptual  framework  on  causes  of  malnutrition  to  know  the  immediate  and 

underlying causes  of malnutrition and the  risks associated  with it. The immediate causes 

of  malnutrition  included  inadequate  food  intake  and  disease  while  underlying  causes 

comprised  household  food  security,  the  social  and  environment  care,  and  the  health 

service delivery 

 

Analysis  was  done  on  the  EPI-INFO  6.04,SPSS  and  STATA  software  to  determine  the 

prevalence of severe and moderate acute malnutrition on the basis of W/H Z-scores and 

%  of  the  Median.  W/H  Z-scores  are  used  because  this  is  the  most  reliable  statistical 

measure  of  malnutrition,  and  is  the  nutritional  indicator  recommended  by  WHO. 

Percentage of the median W/H was calculated because this is easily understood. Also, in 

most  feeding  programmes  children  are  admitted  on  the  basis  of  %  W/H,  hence  the 

prevalence of malnutrition according to % W/H provided a better estimate of the number 

that can be anticipated for feeding programmes.   

 

Cut-off points for children:  

Classification: Indicator 

Moderate malnutrition< -2 W/H Z-scores and >-3 Z-scores 

Severe malnutrition: <- 3 W/H Z-scores and/or presence of bilateral pitting (oedema) of 

the feet. 

 

The prevalence of malnutrition in children below <-2 and <-3 Z-scores, and the 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

9 

confidence  intervals  was  worked  on  to  indicate  the  precision  of  the  estimate  obtained. 

The  age  and  sex  distribution  of  the  population  was  analysed  to  see  whether  there  was 

any  abnormality.  A  high  prevalence  of  malnutrition  in  children  above  36  months  is 

usually an indicator of acute food insecurity.     

 

1.5 

Limitations 

     The In-depth Assessment faced a few limitations which included the following: 

•  Although  20  SEAs  were  selected  for  each  district,  the  teams  collected 

information from at least 14 SEAs due to time constraints. The 14 SEAs were 

selected  purposively  depending  on  the  flood/dry  spell  status.  However, 

caution  was  taken  to  ensure  that  the  selected  SEAs  were  well  spread  out  to 

ensure maximum variability.  

• 

Information on HIV prevalence could not be collected in this study, although it 

would have been useful, since HIV plays a key role in issues of food security. 

The  design  of  this  study  did  not  allow  for  collection  of  HIV/AIDS  prevalence 

information  since  such  meaningful  information  can  only  be  done  through 

actual testing of people in the visited households which was outside the scope 

of this study. However, proxy information on HIV was captured. This included 

information  on  chronic  illnesses  among  adults  and  also  information  on 

households  and  persons  benefiting  from  ART  programmes  from  district  and

CONTEXT 

2.1 

The Economy  

Although  the  target  growth  rate  of  6%  for  2006  was  not  achieved  the  economy 

performed  well.  The  real  gross  domestic  product  growth  rate  for  2006  was  5.8  percent 

increasing  from  5.2  percent  in  2005.  Annual  inflation  rate  dropped  to  its  lowest  in  the 

last 30 years reaching a low of 8.2 percent as of December 2006 compared to the annual 

targeted  inflation  rate  of 10  percent.  This  was  a major  achievement  compared  to  2005 

when  it  was  17.5  percent.  Growth  rate  was  largely  driven  by  mining,  construction  and 

transport sectors. Agriculture, tourism and manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade and 

other  service  sectors  registered  positive  growth.  Interest  rates  have  been  gradually 

falling  though  still  prohibitive  for  borrowing.  This  impediment  to  borrowing  has  kept 

private investment in agriculture very low. The low investment in agricultural equipment 

and early warning/preparedness systems has left the sector highly vulnerable to climatic 

change. 

 

The agriculture sector grew by 3.9 percent in 2006. This was mainly on account of high 

production  of  crops.  In  particular  a  surplus  harvest  of  1.4  million  MT  of  maize  was 

recorded  during  the  2005/06  farming  season  compared  to  886,000  MT  in  the  2004/5 

farming season. This was as a result of not only the favourable weather conditions and 

increased  credit  but  also  government  programmes  such  as  the  fertilizer  support 

programme,  food  security  Pack  and  out  grower  Schemes  which  boosted  production  of 

food  and  cash  crops  among  the  1.3m  small  scale  farmers.  Although  the  2006/7 

production  season  was  characterised  by  localised  adverse  rainfall  conditions  it  has 

recorded  surplus  production  of  1.36  MT  with  only  marginal  reduction  of  4%  in 

comparison  to  previous  years.  In  this  regard  the  government  intends  to  continue 

focusing on increasing food security, crop diversification and opening up new agricultural 

production areas. The fertilizer support program will continue at 50% subsidy level. 

 

2.2 

Input Distribution 

The various Input Distribution Programmes have continued to have a positive impact on 

access to inputs for farmers in the past agricultural season since the programmes started 

more  than  five  (5)  years  ago.  Unfortunately,  most  farmers  remain  substantially 

dependent  on 

inputs  distributed  by  the  Government  and  Non  Governmental 

Organisations  without  graduating  into  self  sustaining  farmers.  The  major  input 

programmes  are  GRZ  Fertilizer  Support  Programme  (FSP),  PAM’s  Food  Security  Pack 

(FSP)  and  the  FAO  input  programme.  All  these  programmes  were  necessitated  by  the 

need to facilitate farmers’ recovery from previous droughts.

Since 2005/06 agricultural season, there has been a general increase in the quantity of 

inputs  as  well  as  beneficiaries  targeted.  The  total  maize  seed  and  fertilizer  distributed 

rose  by  50%  and  55%  respectively  in  the  2006/7  season  with  respect  to  the  previous 

season  while  targeted  beneficiaries  increased  by  42%  in  comparison  to  the  2005/6 

season.  This  increase  is  a  deliberate  move  by  government  to  increase  production  and 

enhance food security both at household and national level. 

 

The  input  support  for  wetland  production  which  could  have  helped  the  severely  flood 

affected farmers fill in the food gap during the lean period (November to February), has 

significantly  dropped.  Apart  from  the  EU  supported  programmes  in  North  Western  and 

Western province and PAM, there has been poor response for the wetland input support 

programme.   

 

2.3 

Food Supply and Access 

Among  major  crops  produced,  maize  and  cassava  continue  to  rank  high  in  terms  of 

output. The production levels of other crops have remained significantly low. Zambia has 

attained  surplus  maize  production  for  the  second  consecutive  year.  This  is  despite  the 

floods and prolonged dry spells experienced in localized areas during the critical part of 

the  growing  season.  However,  the  estimated  maize  output  for  2006/07  dropped 

marginally  (4%)  with  respect  to  the  previous  season,  but  remained  30%  above  the 

recent five year average (2001/2002 to 2005/2006) (figure 1).  Cassava output which is 

also  significant  exceeded  the  previous  year’s  output  and  is  17%  above  average.  This 

could  imply  that  overall;  flood  impact  on  cassava  fields  was  insignificant  in  the  major 

cassava  producing  areas  of  northern  Zambia.  At  national  level,  small  cereals  (sorghum 

and millet) production dropped with respect to the 2005/6 season and five year average 

due  to  reduction  in  the  total  area  planted.  Generally  there  was a reduction  in  all  major 

cash  crop  production  due  to  reduced  area  with  the  exception  of  groundnuts  for  which 

reduced production has been caused by a reduction in yield. For cotton and tobacco, the 

reduction could also be attributed to poor prices during the last marketing season.

Based on the Ministry of Agriculture crop estimate data, maize output in Central Province 

substantially  increased  during  the  2006/07  production  season  from  a  low  figure  of 

210,607MT  to  405,282MT  marking  a  92%  increase.  This  unusually  high  level  of 

production  surpassed  that  of  the  other  high  producing  areas  of  Eastern  and  Southern 

provinces. This increase could be attributed to increased production by small commercial 

farmers in Central Province. 

 

The  20%  drop  in  production  in  Eastern  Province  during  the  2006/07  production season 

with respect to the 2005/06 production season can be attributed to reduced yield due to 

the  adverse  rainfall  impact.  The  drop  in  production  is  highest  in  Katete  and  Chadiza 

Districts  which  have  recorded  at  least  40%  reduction.  Apart  from  Nyimba  whose 

production  dropped  by  26%,  the  reductions in  the  other areas  that  were  visited  by  the 

assessment  team  were  insignificant.  Overall,  the  output  is  at  average  level  for  the 

province.  Conversely,  production  for  Southern  Province  increased  marginally  over  the 

previous  season  despite  experiencing  prolonged  dry  spells  during  part  of  the  growing 

season.  Of  the  nine  districts,  only  Livingstone,  Mazabuka  and  Monze  had  marginal 

production  reductions  of  up  to  10%  while  in  all  other  districts,  production  substantially 

increased including valley areas (Siavonga, Sinazongwe and Gwembe).   

 

For the relatively low producing areas, Western, Northern and Lusaka Provinces all show 

increase in maize production in comparison to the previous season. There was a marked 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

13 

reduction  in  production  in  some  districts  of  North-western  (Kabompo  and  Mwinilunga) 

and Luapula (Samfya, Nchelenge, and Milenge) Provinces. 

 

Cassava is a staple crop for most parts of Luapula, Northern, North Western and Western 

provinces.  The  total  area  planted  for  cassava  increased  by  8  percent  in  the  2006/7 

season  with  respect  to  the  previous  season.  In  the  past  five  years,  cassava  production 

has steadily increased.  In line with the surplus production, maize prices have remained 

relatively  low  and  below  average.  This  has  made  staple  food  accessible  for  most 

households relying on the market. 

 

2.3.1  Crops and Food Supply in 2006/07 Marketing Season 

Despite localised unfavourable weather patterns, the cereal staple supply for the 2006/7 

increased  to  1.84  million  MT  as  compared  to  1.52  million  MT  for  2005/6  season 

representing  a  21%  increase.  Based  on  MACO  data  the  total  available  maize  has 

exceeded the total requirement by 250,000 MT, implying a surplus production year. For 

maize  alone,  the  Government  has  allowed  exports  of  up  to  200,000  MT  for  2007/8 

marketing season as compared to about 200,000 MT for the previous season. 

The  last  three  seasons  saw  the  recovery  of  maize  after  two  years  of deficit production, 

which led Zambia to move from a maize importing country to a major Southern African 

Regional  maize  exporter.  The  WFP  has  in  the  past  three  marketing  seasons  purchased 

substantial  amounts  of  maize  from  Zambia  for  both  its  regional  and  local programmes, 

having  bought  8,904  MT  in  2006/07  season  alone.  Informal  maize  and  mealie  meal 

exports have continued into neighbouring countries like Democratic Republic of Congo.  

 

2.4 

Livestock Situation  

Production of major livestock is concentrated in the three provinces of Central, Southern 

and Western Provinces with cattle contributing  at least 55% share of major livestock  in 

Zambia.  The  other  major  livestock  include  goats  (35%)  and  pigs  (10%).  Cattle 

population  was  estimated  at  2,790,965  at  the  end  of  2006  representing  a  16.1% 

increase  from  the  2004  estimate.  Poultry  continues to  play  a major  role as  a  source  of 

income and food with most household rearing it.  

 

In  the  past  twelve  years,  cattle  production  has  severely  been  disrupted  by  recurring 

disease  outbreaks,  the  common  ones  being  Foot  and  Mouth  Disease  (FMD),  East  Coast 

Fever, Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and New Castle. The FMD is endemic 

in  Sesheke  (Western  Province),  Kazungula  (Southern  Province),  Mbala  and  Nakonde 

(Northern Province), but in 2004 spread to parts of Central and other Southern Province 

districts.  CBPP  is  endemic  in  areas  of  Western  Province,  North-western,  Southern  and 

extreme  Northern  Province  Districts.  East  Coast  Fever  areas  include  Eastern,  Central, 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

14 

Lusaka  and  Northern  Provinces.  Most  of  the  areas  affected  by  these  diseases  are  also 

prone to drought. This often exacerbates farmers’ vulnerability to the effects of drought 

especially  in  Southern  province  by  taking  away  the  means  to  cultivate  their  land 

(draught power) as well as one of the most reliable income sources (Tembo et al, 2006). 

Under  normal  circumstances,  in  these  farming  systems,  livestock  acts  as  some  form  of 

insurance against poor weather and subsequent crop failure. 

 

These  diseases  have  affected  the  farmers  in  terms  of  loss  of  draft  power  and  income 

source.  East  Coast  Fever  has  resulted  in  significant  loss  of  cattle  in  recent  years  and 

continues to be a major threat to cattle population.  

 

Since  May  2007,  cattle  have  been  dying  of  CBPP  in  Chavuma  and  Zambezi  no  control 

measures have yet been put in place. In Western Province (Mongu and Kaoma), despite 

the severe  CBPP outbreak, only 50,000 cattle  out  of target  of 450,000 were  vaccinated 

against  CBPP.  Recurrence  of  outbreaks  will  only  be  effectively  handled  if  vaccination 

control programmes scaled up. 

 

 

2.5  Water and Sanitation 

Zambia has vast water resources in form of rivers, streams, lakes and ground water. The 

country  generates  an  estimated  100  Km  3  per  year  of  surface  water  and  an  estimated 

annual renewable groundwater potential of 49.6 Km 3 per year (DWA/JICA, 1995). Most 

of  the  surface  water  is  poorly  distributed  while  groundwater  is  fairly  well  distributed. 

However, declining rainfall patterns over the years have had a significant adverse impact 

on  the  country’s  water  resources.  In  terms  of  groundwater,  Zambia  has  favourable 

geological  conditions  for  accessing  groundwater  with  regard  to  depth,  storage capacity, 

available yields and exploitation potential.  

 

However,  water  resource  management  has  not  succeeded  to  substantially  improve 

access  to  water  or  prevent  the  pollution  of  both  surface  and  groundwater.  Similarly, 

access to sanitation especially in rural areas is still very low.   

In  view  of  these,  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Zambia  through  its  responsible 

Ministries  of  Energy  and  Water  Development  and  Local  Government  and  Housing  and 

stakeholders  including  private  sector,  NGOs  and  Cooperating  Partners,  has  formulated 

the  necessary  policies  and  legal  instruments  and  is  implementing  strategies  and 

programmes  aimed  at  increasing  access  to  safe  water  and  proper  sanitation.  The 

National Water Policy of 1994 (currently under review), Water Supply and Sanitation Act 

of  1997,  the  1994  National  Environmental  Support  Programme,  the  Water  Resources 

Master  Plan  (1995  to  2015),  National  Irrigation  Plan  and  the  Water  Resources 

Management Bill give evidence to Government’s commitment to improving the quality of 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

15 

life of its people through effective development, use and management of water resources 

as well as provision of proper sanitation. 

  

Furthermore,  the  Government  has  over  the  years  implemented  a  number  of  water  and 

sanitation  programmes  such  as  the  Water  Resources  Action  Programme,  Rural  Water 

Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) Programme and the District-Water, Sanitation and Health 

Education (D-WASHE) support programme. 

 

By 2003, 53% of the population had access to improved water sources. The majority of 

the  rural  people  access  their  water  from  rivers/lakes  and  unprotected  wells,  which  are 

not “safe” or “improved”.  

 

The Millennium Development Goals Status Report of 2005 states that access to improved 

sanitation in Zambia was 65% (80% urban and 57% rural) in the year 2003.  

 

2.6 

Child  Health  and  NutritionThe  induction  of  an  immune  response  through 

vaccination  is  a  widely  accepted  public  health  strategy  for  the  prevention  of  vaccine-

preventable  infectious  diseases.  To  be  considered  fully  vaccinated  a  child  should  have 

received one dose of BCG, three doses each of DPT and four polio vaccines and one dose 

of measles vaccine. The WHO recommends that a child should complete the schedule of 

vaccinations before the age of 12 months.  

 

The national level malnutrition status is high. According to the 1992 ZDHS data, Stunting 

40% of the children were reported to be stunted, 25% underweight and 5% wasting. In 

1996, 42% of the children were stunted, 24% underweight and 4% wasting. In 2002 the 

figures  increased  to  47%,  28%  and  5%  for  stunting,  underweight  and  wasting 

respectively. According to the Annual report 2004 the underweight Prevalence were 21% 

in 2003 and 17% in 2004.  

 

2.6.1  Child Feeding Practices 

The  pattern  of  infant  feeding  has  an  impact  on  both  the  child  and  mother.  Feeding 

practices are the principal determinants of child’s nutritional status.  

 

Breast-feeding  as  one  of  the  child  feeding  strategies  is  universal  in  Zambia,  although 

exclusive Breast-feeding is not widely practiced. The Global strategy for infant and young 

child  feeding  adapted  by  Zambia,  recommends  that  the  child  should  be  exclusively 

breastfed  for  the  first  six  months  of  life.  During  the  first  six  months,  exclusive 

breastfeeding  plays  an  important  role  in  the  survival  of  the  child.  In  rural  areas  62 

percent  of  children  were  fed  at  least  three  times  in  a  day  compared  to  70  percent  in 

urban  areas.  About  60  percent  of  children  in  age  category  10  –  12  months  were  fed 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

16 

three  or  more  times  in  a  day  (LCMS,  2002-2003).  Poor  nutritional  status  in  young 

children exposes them to greater risks of morbidity.  

 

In  view  of  this  situation  the  government  is  committed  to  promoting  health  child  and 

nutrition through a number of strategies which includes the following: infant and young 

child  feeding  promotions,  growth  monitoring  promotion,  micro  nutrient  control  and 

management of severe malnutrition. 

 

2.7  Health  

Health is one of the major factors with significant impact on the living conditions of the 

population. The Government of the Republic of Zambia has committed itself to improving 

the quality of health for all Zambians through its efforts to improve health care delivery 

by  reforming  the  health  sector.  An  important  component  of  the  health  policy  reform  is 

the  restructured  Primary  Health  Care  (PHC)  programme,  which  aims  to,  among  other 

things; deal with the main health problems in the community.   

 

Government  is  committed  to  provide  cost  effective,  quality  health  services  as  close  to 

the family as possible in order to ensure equity of access in health service delivery and 

contribute to the human and socio-economic development of the nation. 

 

According  to  the  annual  statistical  bulletin  of  2005  the  top  ten  causes  of  health  facility 

visitation  were  malaria,  respiratory  infection  (non  pneumonia),  diarrhoea  (non  bloody), 

trauma,  respiratory  infections  (pneumonia),  skin  infections,  eye  infections,  ear/nose 

throat  infection,  digestive  system  (non  infection)  and  muscular  skeletal  and  connective 

tissue. 

 

2.7.1 HIV/AIDS 

The 2001-2002 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) reported that a total of 

15.6 percent of population aged between 15 and 49 years was found to be HIV positive. 

The  epidemic  is  at  different  levels  of  evolution  in  Zambia  with  urban  having  a  stable 

epidemic while the rural areas are yet to stabilize. More women (17.8%) than men (12.9 

%) were affected. It also showed that except  for the  older women aged 40 and above, 

more women than men below 40 were infected. The prevalence was higher in urban than 

in rural areas. 

 

2.8 

Education  

Education  attainments  of  individuals  have  a  bearing  on  their  well  being  in  terms  of 

health,  poverty  and  other  characteristics  such  as  employment  and  earnings,  and 

nutrition  status.  The  official  entry  age  into  grade  one  in  Zambia  is  seven  (7)  years 

although some children start school earlier (5 or 6 years).  

 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

17 

The LCM 2002/2003 showed that thirteen percent of individuals aged 5 to 6 years were 

reported to be attending school. The results also showed that 68 percent, 85 percent, 75 

percent,  56  percent,  and  21  percent  of  lower  basic,  middle  basic,  upper  basic,  high 

school and post high school age respectively, were attending school. More females than 

males started school earlier as suggested by the attendance rates for  age group 5 to 6 

years. The gross school attendance rates were at 94 percent and 30 percent for primary 

and  secondary  school  levels,  respectively.  The  gross  attendance  rates  for  primary 

schools  were  93  percent  for  rural  and  96  percent  for  urban  areas.  Gross  attendance 

rates  for  males  were  relatively  higher  than  females  nearly  at  all  grades.  The  gross 

attendance  rates  for  primary  schools  were  higher  than  those  for  secondary  schools.  In 

rural  areas  the  gross  school  attendance  rates  at  secondary  level  were  very  low,  at  16 

percent  compared  to  55  percent  in  urban  areas.  In  urban  areas,  the  lowest  gross 

attendance  rate  for  secondary  school  was  for  persons  in  the  low  cost  areas  with  48 

percent. The highest rate was for persons in the high cost stratum with 81 percent. 

 

The LCM  report further showed that about 27.2 percent  of the population aged 5  years 

and above had never attended any formal education. About 25 percent of those with no 

formal  education  are  males  and  30  percent  females.  These  were  attributed  to  lack  of 

financial support, the perception that school is not important and never being enrolled. 

 

Adult  illiteracy  averages  33%  while  in  the  young  adult  group  of  15  to  24  years  it  is 

around  30%.  Illiteracy  is  mostly  high  among  females  than  males.  This  is  due  to  the 

negative  attitudes  to  girl  child  education.  Parents  attach  greater  importance  to  the 

duration  of  the  male  children  and  see  education  of  girls  as  only  good  for  marriage  and 

not for employment. Eastern, Northern and Western Provinces have the highest illiteracy 

levels  of  over  40%.  There  is  a  correlation  between  level  of  under  development  and 

illiteracy.  The  regions  with  high  illiteracy  are  generally  those  that  have  low  per  capita 

income (UNDP, Zambia Human Development Index, 2006).  

    

2.9 

Infrastructure and Habitations 

Development of  infrastructure is one of the key poverty reduction mechanisms that the 

government has put in place to contribute towards improving the living conditions of the 

poor and vulnerable communities. In most of the rural areas government in collaboration 

with  co-operating  partners  set  up  institutions  such  as  the  Zambia  Social  Investment 

Fund  and  the  Micro  Projects  Unit  to  undertake  community  based  infrastructure 

development  projects.  According  to  the  LCMS  2004  the  most  widespread  infrastructure 

projects  in  the  rural  areas  are  rehabilitation/resurfacing  of  roads,  provision  and 

improvement of education infrastructure and health facilities. 

 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

18 

About 80% of the country depends on gravel  and feeder roads connecting districts and 

wards to each other. This is a vital and strategic link for the supply of goods and services 

to the communities in various parts of the country.  

Government has encouraged the establishment of schools and health centres in the rural 

areas  through  community  development  programmes  such  as  rehabilitation  of  existing 

infrastructure.  However,  most  of  the  infrastructure  especially  in  the  educational  sector 

remains in a poor state as most community schools are built from pole and mud.   

 

A  list  of  affected  roads,  bridges  and  buildings  of  economic  importance  affected  by  the 

floods was compiled during the Rapid Flood Assessment. The report recommended that a 

more  detailed  and  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  extent  of  the  damage  to 

infrastructure in the affected districts be undertaken. 

 

In terms of human settlements and habitations, most houses in rural Zambia are below 

standard in terms of durability. This is as a result of people using inappropriate building 

materials such as pole and mud. Due to the livelihood pattens such as livestock rearing, 

wetland  farming  and  fishing,  some  houses  are  built  along  river  banks.  However  these 

areas are prone to floods.

It is also worth noting that elderly headed households (60 years and above) were quite

households was between 5 to 6 members, which is in line with the findings of the Living 

Conditions  Monitoring  Survey  (LCMS,  2004).  The  assessment  also  revealed  that 

household  heads  had  diverse  educational  levels.  Majority  of  household  heads  have 

primary education (55%).  

Furthermore,  63%  of  the  spouses  have  also  attained  primary  education.  About  14%  of 

the  sampled  households  indicated  having  an  orphan  in  their  households  and  of  these, 

98% had at least one orphan. 72% of the sampled households indicated having at least 

one under five child.   

 

3.1.2  Household Food Security  

The  needs  and  vulnerability  assessment  covered  mainly  rural  households  in  forty  five 

(45) districts of Zambia. Despite varying rainfall intensities experienced in most districts, 

the 2006/07 production was above average. Most households have continued to display 

diverse  food  sources  such  as  purchases,  casual  labour,  and  barter,  in  addition  to  own 

production.

3.1.2.1 Contribution of Own produced Maize Equivalent and Other Means 

to Total Maize 

Although  households  have  a  diversity  of  livelihoods,  it  is  evident  that  own  production 

remains a dominant source  of staple food. Contribution of own production to household 

staple  consumption  was  found  to  be  82%  with  the  remaining  18%  coming  from  other 

sources (purchases, remittances, gifts)-Figure 3.

Source: 2007 In-depth 

This  dominance  of  own  production  in  most  rural  household  provides  an  insight  into  the 

possible  food  insecurity  risk  resulting  from  hazards  such  as  floods  and  droughts.  

Generally in some of the assessed districts, production of main staples at household level 

marginally  reduced.  The  reduction  in  the  yields  during  the  2006/07  season  was  mainly 

attributed to flash floods, water logging and prolonged dry spells. However, the level of 

impact  was  minimal  on  the  overall  harvest  as  most  households  still  managed  to  get 

substantial amount of food for their own consumption. 

 

The  level  of  production  with  respect  to  sex  of  household  head  still  remains  unbalanced 

with  male  headed  households  taking  dominance.  On  average,  most  male  headed 

households  produce  more  than  those  that  are  female  headed.  About  40%  of  male 

headed  households  produced  more  than  600Kg  as  compared  to  only  26%  of  female 

headed households. More female headed households (50%) produced less than 300Kg in 

comparison to their male counterparts (36%).

It  is  also  evident  that  most  rural  households  have  poor  access  to  animal  and/or 

mechanical draught power. In view of this, households with a high number of household 

members produced more than those that had a smaller number.

 Figure  5  shows  that  during 

the  2006/07 

production 

season, 

out 

of 

the 

households  with  more  than 

seven  (7)  members  20.7% 

to  37.1%  of  them  produced 

more  than  1,200  kg  maize 

equivalent. 

This 

is 

in 

comparison  to  10.3%  to 

18.4%  of  households  with 

less  than  seven  members 

that  produced 

the  same 

amount.  This  implies  that  households  with  few  members  who  have  limited  access  to 

mechanical and/or draught power will continue to cultivate and produce less even if the 

climatic conditions are favourable.   

 

The  Impact  on  livestock  diseases  was  generally  moderate  with  only  a  few  areas  being 

severely affected. Only 20% of the assessed communities indicated experiencing severe 

impact of floods on livestock diseases which could be as result of animals being confined 

in  limited  grazing  land  which  increases  the  potential  for  disease  outbreak.  The 

consequences  of  this  disruption  in  cattle  movement  have  been  seen  in  the  increase  of 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

22 

CBPP,  Anthrax  and  Haemorrhagic  Septicaemia.  Although  pasture  was  also  impacted 

through  flooding  there  was  plenty  of  pasture  for  animals  following  the  receding  of  the 

water which was a positive development. 

3.1.3  Livelihoods 

3.1.3.1 Income Sources  

The  assessment  revealed  that  most  rural  households  have  diverse  sources  of  income 

(Figure 6) Major income sources for most households have generally remained the same 

this  marketing  season  compared  to  the  last  marketing  season  with  most  of  them 

engaging  in  casual  labour,  sale  of  crops  and  petty  trade  as  the  three  most  common 

activities

These  are  followed  by  sale  of  fish  and  formal  employment.  The  major  difference  in 

income  sources  from  the  previous  season  is  in  the  reduction  of  households  (13%) 

intending  to  sale  cereal.  This  suggests  that  slightly  more  households  will  keep  their 

harvest for own consumption either due to reduced availability or increased consumption 

requirement.  Furthermore,  additional  households  intend  to  engage  in  casual  work  and 

petty  trade  compared  to  the  previous  season  which  is  a  response  to  reduced  income 

from cash crops. The reduction in cash crop (cotton and tobacco) sale can be attributed 

to  reduced  production  of  these  crops  in  response  to  poor  prices  that  prevailed  in  the 

2006/07 marketing year. 

 

3.1.3.2 

Expenditure Pattern  

Expenditure on key elements such as agricultural inputs, health and other food items is 

significantly  low.  The  pattern  has  remained  the  same  as  the  previous  season.  However 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

23 

there  is  a  marginal  drop  (3%)  in  households spending  on  household  items  while cereal 

expenditure  has seen a marginal  increase of 2%(Figure 7).  This suggests that there is 

no  major  shift  in  household  expenditure  patterns  compared  to  the  previous  season. 

Major  expenditure  shift  on  items  such  as  transport  and/or  poultry  products  (e.g.  milk, 

eggs) are insignificant. 

 

The  assessment  results  revealed  that,  most  households  use  their  income  to  purchase 

cereal and household items followed by non staple and education expenditure.

3.1.3.3 Seasonal Calender 

Out of 143 communities sampled in the forty five districts visited, it is evident that most 

of  the  livelihood  activities  that  sampled  communities  are  engaged  in  vary  in  their 

temporal characteristics. In terms of the agronomic practice calendar, it was evident that 

most  communities did  their land  preparations  from  July through  to  September  of  every 

year  while  planting  starts  in  November  through  to  December  as  outlined  in  Annex  9 

Weeding  on  the  other  hand  starts  in  December/January  depending  on  how  early  the 

planting is done. 

 

In terms of the food source calendar, it is evident that consumption of green food starts 

in February through March. However this very much depends on the start as well as the 

stability of the rainy season. Overall, harvest in most these sampled communities starts 

in  April  through  June  depending  on  the  varieties  of  crops  grown  (e.g.  early  or  late 

maturing  varieties).  It  is  however  worth  noting  that  while  consumption  of  green  food 

done  by  most  households  in  sampled  communities,  collection  of  wild  foods  is 

concurrently being done as well. These alternative wild foods do provide the households 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

24 

a diversity of  foods consumed. For the communities where fishing was the main  or one 

of  the  main  sources  of  food  and/or  income,  it  was  evident  that  most  of  it  started  in 

March and ended  in December when the  fishing ban is on. The assumption  here is that 

these  households  would  have  generated  enough  money  to  buy  extra  food  to  bridge  up 

the food deficits if any. Furthermore, it was also evident that the majority of the sampled 

communities  indicated  that  consumption  of  own  produced  food  started  February  2007 

and will last them up to December 2007. This implies that most of the households in the 

sampled  communities  will  manage  to  consume  own  produced  food  with  little  or  no 

reliance on other sources. 

 

Furthermore, the income sources calendar reveals that a diversity of income generating 

activities are being implemented by most of the households in the sampled communities.  

These range from labour exchange on farms that start in December through to February, 

off farm  labour activities such as small scale trading that starts in May/June through to 

August.  These  income  sources  provide  an  avenue  for  these  households  to  acquire 

additional foods from other sources such as purchases, payment in kind from working on 

farms etc.  The synergy between agronomic, and income source food calendars confirms 

how  sustainable  and  reliable  these  livelihood  components  have  on  the  general  food 

security  situation  of  the  sampled  communities.  It  is  also  evident  that  when  own 

produced food is finished, it will definitely be supplemented by other sources described in 

the food and income source calendar. 

 

3.1.3.4. 

Coping Strategies 

The  assessment  findings  show  that  the  main  coping  strategy  employed  by  most 

households is consumption of meals with vegetables only (65%) followed by reduction in 

number  of  meals  (55%)  and  reliance  on  less  preferred  foods  (41%)(Figure  8).  The 

results also show that the major coping strategies employed by most households relate 

to reduction of food intake in terms of amounts or quality. The non- direct food related 

strategies such as pulling children out of school, sale of productive assets, and increased 

sale  of  livestock  are  employed  less.  This  implies  that  in  case  of  food  deficit,  most 

household’s  immediate  response  is  to  reduce  food  consumption  which  has  serious 

implications  on  the  nutrition  status  of  the  households.  Also  notable  is  that  more 

households would rather reduce health expenditure than pull their children out of school. 

However, more households would rather cut back on both health and education than sell 

additional livestock which can be used to cover such costs.

3.1.4  Market Situation 

Generally,  maize  prices  have  remained  relatively  low  and  below  average  in  rural  areas 

(Figure  8).  However,  findings  show  that  nominal  prices  in  Chilubi  and  Kalabo  districts 

during  the  month  of  May  2007,  were  exceptionally  high  at  K1,200/Kg  which  is  about 

58%  higher  than  the  FRA  maize  purchasing  price  of  K760/Kg  and  100%  above  the 

average  price  for  the  assessed  districts.  Compared  to  the  same  period  in  2006,  most 

districts  recorded  price  increases  with  Mpika,  Lukulu  and  Shangombo  recording  price 

increments  of  over  80%.  Other  notable  areas  with  high  price  increases  (at  least  60%) 

were  in  Southern  Province  (Gwembe,  Kazungula,  Mazabuka,  Monze);  and  Northern 

(Kaputa, Mporokoso) respectively. It is worth noting that maize prices in May 2006 were 

exceptionally low following the surplus harvest of 2005/06 production season. Therefore 

these  price  increases  do  not  necessarily  imply  a  maize  supply  problem.  Maize  prices  in 

May  2007  were  in  the  range  of  K278/Kg  in  Kazungula  to  K833/Kg  in  Kafue  and 

Sinazongwe (when Chilubi and Kalabo are excluded). Most districts (60%) recorded low 

maize prices  of  below  K600/Kg. These  price  levels  are  associated  with adequate  supply 

of the commodity for that time of the year.   

 

In  the  case  of  cassava,  only  three  districts  (Mporokoso,  Isoka,  Sesheke)  recorded 

significant price increases (50% and above) in comparison to the prices that prevailed in 

May 2006. Of these, only one district (Mporokoso) consume cassava as a staple while in 

Isoka and Sesheke districts, maize is predominantly consumed.  

 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

26 

The price of small grains (sorghum and millet)  has remained stable  in  almost all of the 

assessed districts, with the exception of Mporokoso and Isoka where prices increased by 

100%.  The  two  districts  do  not  consume  the  small  grains  as  staple  food.  Price  of  rice 

either remained the same or rose to the advantage of producers, this being a cash crop. 

 

Most  of  the  districts  whose  maize  prices  rose  significantly  are  also  major  livestock 

rearing  areas.  Cattle  prices  in  most  of  the  assessed  districts  either  rose  sharply  or 

remained  stable  with  respect  to  the  month  of  December  (lean  period).  Only  three 

districts  (Mazabuka,  Chibombo  and  Kaoma)  registered  moderate  price  drops.  The  fact 

that prices in most districts rose suggests that there is no desperation for households to 

sell  off  their  cattle  at  low  prices  as  they  are  able  to  negotiate  for  higher  prices.  This 

situation is very much associated with good food availability. The situation is similar for 

the other types of livestock. However Monze and Luwingu registered a drop in prices of 

pigs (25%), while Luwingu also registered drops in goats and poultry prices of 33% and 

40% respectively  

 

Generally,  although  maize  prices  have  increased  in  comparison  to  the  same  period  in 

2006, the price levels are still low in most districts. Only Chilubi and Kalabo are showing 

exceptionally high maize prices suggesting a possible low supply of maize on the market. 

Other districts exhibiting moderately high prices were Sinazongwe, Siavonga, Lukulu and 

Kafue  districts  which  are  pre  dominantly  low  maize  producing  areas.  The  fact  that 

livestock  prices  in almost  all  assessed  districts  have  significantly  increased  with respect 

to  the  situation  that  prevailed  during  the  lean  period  suggests  low  pressure  on  food 

situation.   

 

3.1.5 Food Needs 

The finding established that only 14 districts out of the 45 assessed districts will require 

food assistance 6 months (September,2007 to February,2008) while thirteen districts will 

be  placed  under  monitoring  from  now  until  the  next  harvest(Annex  3).  These  were  the 

only districts that could not fill up the gap after considering all livelihood options. 

 

3.2  NUTRITION  

A  total  of  6,240  children  aged  between  6  -  59  months  were  assessed  from  the  12,000 

households  from  the  45  districts.  Approximately  3.8%  of  the  records  were  flagged  and 

excluded  from  the  analysis  process;  hence  6001  records  were  included  in  the  final 

analysis  for  anthropometrical  indices.  However,  the  flagged  records  were  incorporated 

into the analysis when estimating the morbidity prevalence of the studied population.  

 

Table  2  shows  the  age  and  sex  distribution  of  the  sampled  children.  There  are  no 

significant differences in the age and sex distribution of the children (p>0.05)

3.2.1 Acute Malnutrition or Wasting (Weight for Height) 

The overall prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) and Severe Acute Malnutrition 

(SAM)  of  the  sampled  population,  using  the  weighted  mean  from  all  the  45  districts  is 

shown in the table 3 below.

There are significant differences in acute malnutrition by age group. The analyses further 

indicate  that  children  aged  between  6-  41  months  were  more  wasted  than  the  older 

children. 

 

3.2.2 Chronic malnutrition 

The  survey  also  estimated  prevalences  of  stunting  (low  height-for-age),  which  reflects 

chronic malnutrition and underweight (low weight-for-age) which reflect both acute and 

chronic  malnutrition  (see  Table  5).  All  efforts  were  made  to  record  the  age  of  the 

children as accurately as possible, as described in the methodology section.

3.2.3 Health Status of the sampled population 

Caretakers were asked if the child had been ill during the two weeks prior to the survey. 

The survey specifically asked about diarrhoea (watery and/or bloody), cough, fever and 

measles.  Figure  9  shows  the  overall  prevalence  of  illness  among  children  6-59  months 

from the 45 districts that were surveyed.

Fever  Cough  Diarrhoea  Skin Infection 

Cough was the most commonly reported problem, with 30.9% of children (6-59 months) 

having  had  suffered  from it  in all  the districts  visited.  Fever  affected  14.5%  of  children 

and 14.5% had suffered from diarrhoea in the fortnight before the survey. None of these 

were reported to have had bloody diarrhoea (this was not verified by the survey workers 

or health practitioners). Overall, the rates of reported illness were high though fever and 

diarrhoea were substantially lower as compared to the same time last year during June 

2006  rapid  vulnerability  assessment  survey.  This  finding  is  somewhat  surprising  given 

the  reported  effect  of  floods  on  sanitary  facilities  and  water  sources  in  the  surveyed 

districts.  One  possible  explanation  could  be  attributed  to  the    responses  made  by 

Government and partners during the flood period. 

 

3.2.4 Child Feeding Practices 

Appropriate  feeding  practices  are  of  fundamental  importance  for  the  survival,  growth 

development,  health  and  nutrition  status  of  infants  and  children.  Feeding  practices  are 

one of the underlying determinants of child nutrition status, which in turn influences the 

risk of illness and ultimately death. Despite the high breastfeeding prevalence (98%) in 

Zambia, only 40 % of the infants are exclusively breastfed (CSO, 2001/2).  

 

Breastfeeding Practices 

Breastfeeding  status  was  based  upon  maternal  recall.  Mothers  were  first  asked  if  they 

were  still  breastfeeding  any  child  at  the  time  of  the  survey.  Overall,  65%  of  mothers 

were  currently  breastfeeding  a  child  at  the  time  of  the  assessment.10%  had  received 

solid/semi solid foods in the past 24 hours.  

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007

3.2.5 Vitamin A Supplementation 

3.2.5.1 Vitamin A Coverage 

Due to the importance of Vitamin A, and its relationship with malnutrition and measles, 

all  eligible  children  aged  between  6-59months  were  assessed  if  they  had  received 

Vitamin  A  supplement  over  six  months  prior  to  the  assessment.  Out  of  the  sampled 

children from the 45 district, 82.5% had received the Vitamin A supplement. This figure 

is similar to the 80% threshold from bi-annual child health week campaigns (vitamin A is 

distributed as part  of the health care package) and routine  Vitamin  A supplementation; 

however, 17.5% of eligible children did not receive the Vitamin A supplement. This was 

attributed  to  logistical  constraints  in  the  districts  to  access  some  areas  and  also 

inadequate health personnel. The high vitamin A supplementation coverage is indicative 

of mothers becoming more enlightened on the importance of vitamin A, through the bi-

annual  child  health  week  events  campaign  programme  and  routine  vitamin  a 

supplementation in the health facilities.

Fever Cough Diarrhea

Malnourished children were likely to have been sick two weeks prior to the survey. About 

50.8%  of  the  malnourished  children  had  suffered  from  fever  in  the  two  weeks  prior  to 

the  assessment,  hence  there  was  a  strong  relationship  between children  suffering  from 

fever  and  being  malnourished  –this  association  may  be  a  reflection  of  high  prevalence. 

Fever  was  self-reported  by  the  caregiver  but  not  clinically  verified;  the  survey  did  not 

record  cases  of  diagnosed  malaria  separately.  The  same  was  observed  for  cough  with 

wasting  prevalence  of  61.7%  children  6-59  months  who  had  suffered  from  it.  The 

prevalence of malnutrition amongst children who had had diarrhoea was 21.4%. Chronic 

malnutrition  is  a  long-term  process  and  therefore  the  recent  bout  of  diarrhoeal  illness 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

31 

was not  directly  related  to  stunting,  but  of  their vulnerability  to  illness  because  of  their 

condition. 

 

3.2.6 Relationship between nutritional status and source of water 

Wasting  (mean  weight  for  height  Z-score)  was  strongly  significantly  associated  with 

unsafe  drinking  water  source.  Malnutrition  prevalence  was  62.6%  for  those  consuming 

water from unsafe water source.  

 

3.2.7 Relationship between nutritional status and type of latrine 

There  was  a  slight  association  between  wasting  and  the  type  of  latrines  used  by 

households (significant at p<0.05 based on mean Z-score). The prevalence of wasting in 

households using traditional latrines was 13% compared to 12% with improved latrines. 

 

3.2.8 Household food security situation and malnutrition 

Household food security was not significantly associated with child malnutrition, whether 

acute (wasting) or chronic (stunting). This however does not mean that no malnourished 

children were found in severely or moderately food insecure households, but it indicates 

that other factors seemed to play a stronger role as determinants of malnutrition.  

 

3.2.8.1 Food availability, proxied by cultivation and Livestock Ownership- 

Relationship between total staple production and nutrition status  

Severe  acute malnutrition  (SAM)  was slightly  lower  (  2.2%)  -for  children  in  households 

having  produced  none  of  the  staple  crop  during  the  2005/6  season  compared  to  2.5% 

for children from similar household during the 2006/7 season (Figure 11).

3.3  HEALTH 

 

Health is an important component of one’s life in so far as human survival is concerned. 

In a bid to try and alleviate the health problems that may have been caused by floods or 

prolonged  dry  spells,  the  in-depth  vulnerability  assessment  collected  information  on 

immunizations,  illnesses  in  the  households,  chronic  illnesses,  deaths  in  the  households 

and age at death.  

 

3.3.1  Immunizations 

Generally  immunization  coverage  of  children  (0-59  months)  was  high  in  the  forty-five 

(45) districts assessed. BCG had the highest coverage with 90%, immunizations against 

DPT averaged 86% and polio vaccinations averaged 82%.  A total of 5% of the children 

had  measles;  73%  were  vaccinated  against  the  disease.  Despite  the 

floods, 

immunisation services were still accessible.

Vaccine

 

 
Clinical data on measles vaccinations was also collected during the assessment. The data 

shows that 21% of the communities indicated that at least one child received a measles 

vaccine in the first quarter of 2005 compared to 8% in 2006 and 12% in 2007.   

 

3.3.2   Illness 

Out  of  the  assessed  households,  a total of 7,828  people  reported  ill  two  weeks  prior to 

the survey, 49% were male and 51% female. Figure 1 shows that malaria was the most 

common  illness,  reported  by  41%, 11%  reported  to  have  had diarrhoea,  23%  reported 

to  have  been  coughing  and  2%  reported  to  have  had  scabies.  Out  of  the  total  children 

under  5,  who  were  reported  to  be  ill,  45%  were  reported  to  have  had  malaria,  17% 

reported to have had diarrhoea, 25% reported to have been coughing and 2% reported 

to have had scabies.

Generally it has been noted that malaria, diarrhoea and RTI/cough cases in the under 5 

was far below the average for the past three (3) years during the second quarter, while 

that of those above the age of five was high. These cases could have been lower in those 

below  five  years  since there were  immediate  measures taken  to mitigate  the  impact of 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

35 

the floods especially targeting this age group and pregnant women. Further, those aged 

above 5 years are more exposed to disease as a result of their outdoor activities. 

 

3.3.3. Deaths in Households 

A  total  of  92%  of  the  12,001  households  interviewed  reported  no  deaths  in  the 

household  in  the  last  6  months,  4%  reported  to  have  had  one  (1)  death,  another  4% 

reported two (2) deaths and the percentage with three (3) deaths or more in the family 

was negligible. 

 

In 113 households, at least one death of a person who was above 16 years and was sick 

for more than three months was reported. Of these, 94% reported one such death, 5% 

reported two deaths and 1% reported at least 3 deaths.  

 

3.3.4  Chronic illness among adults in the past 12 months 

The survey results showed that 16% of the households had at least one adult (16 years 

and  above)  who  was  ill  for  more  than  3  months  in  the  12  month  period  prior  to  the 

survey. Out of these households with chronically ill adults, 64% reported one chronically 

ill  adult,  35%  had  two  while  1%  had  three  or  more.  Furthermore,  about  a  third  of  the 

household members that were reported chronically ill were household heads. 

 

3.3.5  Access and use of health services 

Formal health care was sought by the majority (78%) of the persons in households out 

of  the  total  number  that  recorded  sickness  (Figure  15).  Own  medication  and  visits  to 

traditional healers accounted for 5% and 3%, respectively. The percentage of those who 

did not seek any health was 11%.

Reasons  for  not  seeking  health  care  included  lack  of  money,  lack  of  transport, 

respondents  perception  on  quality  of  health  care,  preference,  severe  illness  which 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

36 

disenabled  a  person  to  be  moved,  home  based  care  and  inaccessibility  of  the  health 

facility.  The  most  common  reason  for  not  seeking  health care  was  inaccessibility of the 

health  facility  reported  by  followed  by  home  based  care.  The  proportion  that  reported 

that  the  patient  was  too  ill  to  be  moved  was  low.  The  proportions  for  the  rest  of  the 

reasons were negligible.  

 

3.4  WATER AND SANITATION 

 In  this  survey  “access  to  clean  and  safe  drinking  water”  was  considered  the  same  as 

“access  to  an  improved  water  source”.  Boreholes  and  protected  sources  were  regarded 

as safe sources while rivers or lakes and unprotected sources were considered unsafe. 

 

3.4.1 Water 

3.4.1.1 Types of Drinking Water Sources and Water Quality  

The  three  most  common  drinking  water  sources  in  the  assessed  districts  were 

unprotected shallow wells, boreholes and river or lake.  Village boreholes were found to 

be the commonest source of water, accounting for about 29% of all households (12,001) 

interviewed  in  the  45  surveyed  districts  (see  Figure  16).  However  overall,  unprotected 

sources  such  as  unprotected  shallow  wells  and  river  or  lakes  were  the  major  source  of 

drinking water accounting for 48% of households.

This  implies  that  a  significant  number  of  households  have  no  access  to  safe  drinking 

water. This is most prevalent in Northern (Mpika, Luwingu, Chinsali, Isoka, Mporokoso), 

North-western  (Mwinilunga,  Zambezi,  Chavuma,  Kabompo)  and  Western  Province 

(Kalabo and Shangombo) 

 

Based  on  the  community’s  perception  of  water  quality,  the  majority  of  them  (58%) 

reported that the water was mostly fair to good while the rest reported poor quality. The 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

37 

quality  of  the  water  was  based  on  aesthetic  characteristics  e.g.,  colour,  appearance  and 

taste.  Despite  the  negative  impact  on  water  quality  during  the  flood  period,  most 

households (75%) did not change the main source of drinking. This suggests that most 

rural households lack alternative sources of safe drinking water. 

 

Very  few  (23%)  households  treat  their  drinking  water  leaving  the  majority  of  the 

households vulnerable to waterborne diseases. The commonest method of treating water 

was the use of chlorine (78%), followed by boiling  (21%) which are very effective. The 

findings  show  that  75% of households  that  reported diarrhoea  cases  did  not  treat  their 

drinking  water.  While  poor  drinking  water  quality  can  significantly  contribute  to  the 

diarrhoea  disease  burden,  poor  hygiene  practice  has  been  linked  to  high  diarrhoeal 

diseases in other surveys. 

 

3.4.1.2 Water Availability 

Compared  to  last  year  (2006),  very  few  of  households  (15%)  had  reduced  water 

quantity at their main water source- Figure 17.

For  most  households  water  quantity  either  remained  the  same  (47%)  or  increased 

(38%). This shows that there was an overall increase in the amount of water, which can 

be attributed to the floods. Only 25% of assessed households reported water drying up.

The results show that majority (83%) of respondents had access to water sources within 

1 kilometre from their houses (Figure 18). Though most households had easy access (< 

1KM distance) the  quality of water remains a challenge as only 23% were treating their 

drinking water. 

 

3.4.1.4  Comparison  of  main  drinking  water  source  with  diarrhoea 

prevalence 

Figure  2  shows  that  out  of  the  total  number  of  households  that  reported  cases  of 

diarrhoea,  31%  used  the  borehole,  21%  used  the  unprotected  shallow  well  while  17% 

used the river or lake (Figure 19). 

 

Although borehole water is considered to be clean and safe, the contamination of water 

could  have  occurred  during  handling  e.g.,  through  poor  hygiene  practice  at  household 

level.

3.4.2 Sanitation 

In  this  report  sanitation  access  is  regarded  as  access  to  improved  sanitation  based  on 

the  United  Nations  (2003)  definition  of  “improved  sanitation”.  This  definition  assumes 

that  facilities  such  as  septic  tank  system,  pour  flush  latrines,  simple  pit  or  ventilated 

improved  pit  latrines  are  likely  to  be  adequate,  provided  that  they  are  not  public  as 

stated  in  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  Zambia  Status  Report  of  2005.  The  report 

puts national coverage for improved sanitation at 65% in 2003. 

 

Despite water and soap being available in the majority (70%), of the households a large 

number  (over  60%)  of  them  do  not  wash  their hands  with  soap before  preparing  food, 

eating and after using the toilets/latrine. 

 

Findings show that the majority (58%) of respondents used traditional pit latrines while 

29%  had  no  sanitary  facility  at  all  (Figure  20).  Areas  with  no  access  to  improved 

sanitation  include  Southern  (Gwembe,  Kazungula,  Namwala,  Sinazongwe),  Eastern 

(Lundazi,  Nyimba), 

 

  Central  (Chibombo)  and  Western  (Kalabo)  provinces.   

Furthermore, about 65% of the assessed households had access to improved sanitation. 

This is in line with the findings of 2003 (MDG Zambia, 2005).

About  64%  of  households  that  reported  diarrhoea  cases  did  not  wash  their  hands  with 

soap  after  using  the  latrine  or  toilet.  The  remaining  diarrhoea  cases  (36%)  could  be 

attributed to other routes of infection like contaminated drinking water or food.  

 

Out of the total number of households that reported cases of diarrhoea, most (56%) use 

traditional latrines while 7.1% use shared latrines and 32% have no facility at all (Figure 

21).

3.5.1  Levels of Education 

On  average  about  56%  of  the  household  heads  have  undergone  primary  school 

education  but  the  majority  failed  to  make  it  into  secondary  school  (only  30%  attained 

secondary education)(Figure 22). There are more women (16%) that have never been to 

school  than  men  (9%).  However,  more  women  attended  primary  education  (66%)  as 

opposed to men  (34%).  This  is mostly  for  Grades 1  to  Grade  5.  The  attendance  of  the 

girls  reduces significantly  from  Grades 6  onwards due to factors such  as coming of age 

and early marriages. More men reached secondary and tertiary education (24% and 2% 

respectively)  than  women  (23%  and  1%  respectively).  The  number  of  people  who 

advanced  to  higher  levels  of  education  decreased  from  one  level  to  a  higher  level  with 

only  2%  reaching  tertiary  education.  The  other  forms  of  education  included  adult 

literacy, vocational skills training and short courses.

Reasons for School Drop outs

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.5.2  School Attendance 

According to the figure 23 for reasons for dropping out of school, 56% (36% males and 

20%  females)  of  the  children  dropped  out  because  the  family  could  not  afford  to  meet 

their  school  requirements.  The  drop  outs  were  mostly  unrelated  to  the  impact  of  the 

floods.  The  results  show  that  more  boys  than  girls  dropped  out  of  school.  On  the 

contrary  the 2005 Educational Statistical Bulletin established that there were more girls 

dropping  out  than  boys  as  families  would  rather  finance  boys  education  than  the  girls 

education because of the belief that the girls would no sooner than later get married.  

 

Secondary school going children prematurely stop school because of the requirement to 

pay school fees, where as in the case of primary school going children paying school fees 

and  also  wearing  uniforms  are  not  a  requirement.  This  confirms  the  results  of  the 

assessment that attendance reduces from lower to higher education. 

 

There  were  more  males  who  dropped  out  of  school  than  females  on  account  of  not 

having interest in school while the differences in numbers between male and female drop 

outs  was  negligible  for  reasons  like  work  for  food/cash,  help  with  household  activities, 

caring  for  sick  family  members  and  hunger  in  the  homes.  However,  it  is  common 

practice  for  girl  children  to  be  more  involved  in  looking  after sick  family  members  than 

boys. 

 

The LCMS of 2004 also established that school attendance rates at primary school were 

marginally  higher  for  female  children  than  for  male  children.  However,  in  terms  of 

secondary  school,  attendance  among  male  children  was  higher  than  that  of  females. 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

43 

More  females  than  males  dropped  out  of  school  because  of  other  reasons,  such  as 

personal  inhibiting  circumstances  like  early  pregnancies,  becoming  of  age  and  early 

marriages. 

 

The  results  of  the  In-depth  assessment  further  showed  that  few  children  (about  1%) 

dropped  out  of  school  because  of  inaccessibility  to  the  schools  and/or  collapsed  school 

buildings,  as  a  result  of  the  floods  experienced.  Furthermore,  in  some  of  the  flood 

affected  areas  the  school  children  shifted  to  the  higher  and  drier  lands  where  they 

continued with their education. In other areas the learning processes continued in make 

shift  structures  and/or  other  community  centres.  However,  this  was  not  conducive  for 

learning  and  the  quality  of  education  was  compromised.  Furthermore  the  relocation  to 

the drier lands and alternative learning environments, took away valuable learning time 

from  the  school  children.  This  has  compelled  government  to  issue  a  directive  to  the 

school  authorities  in  the  affected  areas  to  continue  with  the  school  sessions  during  the 

school holidays. Government  has  focussed  its  attention  on the replacement  of  pole  and 

mad schools with permanent structures (schools). 

 

3.5.3 Household Expenditure on Education 

The  assessment  also  established  that  in  the  forty-five  (45)  districts  assessed  there  has 

been  no  significant  shift  in  the  household  expenditures  on  education  fees  and  costs 

during  the  period  December  2006  to  April  2007  as  compared  to  the  period  December 

2005 to April 2006. A total of 20% of the households interviewed reported to have had a 

reduction  of  overall  expenditure  on  education  costs.  This  was  especially  so  for 

households with children attending secondary school because primary education cost did 

not  include  school  fees.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Ministry  of  Education’s  policy  of  Free 

Primary  Education  in  the  rural  areas.  The  reduction  of  household  expenditures  on 

primary education costs consisted mostly  of expenditure  on PTA funds, school  uniforms 

and  scholastic  materials  such  as  books  and  pens.  However  only  8%  of  the  people 

interviewed reported to have taken children aged 6 to 15 years out of school, because of 

vulnerability. 

 

3.6 INFRASTRUCTURE 

In order to assess the effects of the floods and/or prolonged dry spells on infrastructure, 

it  was  necessary  to  identify  the  types  of  infrastructure  existing  in  the  communities 

sampled. The assessment established that all the communities visited have at least one 

or  more  of  the  following  infrastructure;  gravel  roads,  bridges/culverts,  clinics,  schools 

and boreholes. Total of 92% of the key informant focus groups confirmed the existence 

of  these  infrastructures  in  their  communities.  However,  paved  roads,  markets, 

community halls, dip tanks and storage tanks are not very common in the communities 

assessed. 

 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

44 

The  assessment  further  established  that  infrastructure  was  among  the  most  severely 

affected sectors (61 to 100%) by the floods.  The level of effects differed from one type 

of infrastructure to the other.  

 

3.6.1  Roads and Bridges/Culverts 

Gravel roads and bridges/culverts were the most affected. This was established from key 

informant  interviews  at  both  community  and  district  level  where  an  average  of  55%of 

the  respondents  indicated  that  the  damage  to  roads  was  severe  and  another  54% 

indicated  that  the  damage  to  bridges/culverts  was  severe.  The  roads  become  flooded 

making  them  unusable.  The  affected  bridges/culverts  either  collapsed  or  were  washed 

away.  The  effect  on  paved  roads  on  the  other  hand  was  minimal.  At  the  time  of  the 

assessment  both  the  affected  roads  and  bridges/culverts  were  still  in  a  poor  state  and 

had not been repaired. 

 

A  Technical  Assessment  report  has  been  prepared  by  the  Road  Development  Agency 

(RDA) detailing the nature and extent of the damage to the roads and bridges/culverts in 

the affected districts. The report also provides recommendations for the repairs and cost 

estimates for the works.  

 

3.6.2  Habitations (Houses) 

The  impact  on  habitations  was  moderate  as  54%  of  respondents  reported  that  houses 

collapsed.  At  the  time  of  the  assessment  the  people  whose  houses  had  collapsed  were 

moulding bricks to rebuild their houses. 

 

3.6.3  Health Facilities 

The level of damage to health facilities attributable to the floods was low (an average of 

93% of the key informants at both district and community level confirmed that there was 

no or low effect on the health facilities). The assessment established most of the health 

centres  are  still  in  good  condition.  However  the  health  centres  have  been  dilapidated 

over time due to lack of maintenance.  

 

 

3.6.4  Schools 

The damage to school infrastructure was moderate as indicated by an average of 56% of 

the respondents from the community and district interviews. The damage was mostly on 

community  schools  made  of  pole  and  mud  but  also  included  teachers’  houses  made  of 

poor  quality  materials.  There  were  also  incidences  of  damage  to  the  permanent 

structures  at  the  schools  where  the  roofs  were  blown  off.  The  current  condition  of  the 

physical structures at the schools with permanent buildings is fair. However, the affected 

schools remain in a poor state and need replacement with permanent buildings.   

 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

45 

3.6.5 

 Boreholes and Water Points 

The  assessment  established  that  there  was  no  physical  damage  to  the  boreholes. 

Although  there  were  indications  that  the  quality  of  water  was  poor.  The  other  water 

points such as hand dug wells were flooded and collapsed.  

 

 

3.6.6  Others 

There  was  no  effect  on  markets  as  most  of  the  communities  visited  do  not  have 

physical  markets.  The  trading  is  usually  informal  exchange  of  commodities  (barter 

system).  The  physical  markets  are  located  at  the  district  administrative  centres.  These 

were found not have been impacted upon. 

 

There  was  no  effect  on  churches/community  halls  at  both  district  and  community 

levels.  The  condition  of  the  churches/community  halls  is  poor  because  they  have  not 

been maintained for a long time and not because of the floods. 

 

Information  collected  on  effects  on  dip  tanks  in  the  assessed  areas,  established  that 

there was no effect on dip tanks as these are still in good condition.  

 

The  assessment  established  that  there  was  no  effect  on  storage  sheds  (80% 

response). However the storage sheds are in a bad condition due to lack of maintenance 

over the years.  

 

3.7 VULNERABILITY SITUATION 

The level of vulnerability has been exacerbated by lack of preparedness measures in the 

assessed districts and communities. The assessment established that there are no major 

preparedness  measures  put  in  place.  From  the  focus  group  discussion  at  community 

level and district, 14% and 17% respectively said there are no measures put in place to 

deal  with  hazards  such  floods  and  hazards.  The  major  things  that  were  mentioned  as 

measures put in place  were sensitisation of people along river banks to move to  higher 

ground,  cultivation  of  drought  resistant  crops  and  planting  of  early  maturing  crops. 

These  are  not  preparedness  measures  as  such  but  mitigation.  Given  the  above,  it  is 

inevitable  to  carry  out  the  comprehensive  Vulnerability  Assessment  and  Analysis  to 

identify the hazards, associated risks and the level of vulnerability. This will be the basis 

for any meaningful preparedness measures at district and community levels. 

 

4.0 CONCLUSIONS  
 

4.1.  Food Security  

The  Crop  Forecasting  Survey  has  established  that  the  2006/7  production  season  has 

recorded  a  surplus  for  the  main  staples  (maize  and  cassava)  for  the  second  year 

running.  However  the  assessment  results  show  that  despite  this  national  surplus  there 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

46 

are  some  districts  that  have  recorded  a  reduction  in  production.    Inspite  of  this,  the 

prices  of  these  commodities  in  most  of  the  visited  districts  have  remained  low. 

Furthermore, livestock prices have significantly increased with respect to the lean period 

suggesting  that  there  was  no  desperation  for  households  to  sell.  This  confirms  the  fact 

that  the  impact  of  floods  and/or  prolonged  dry  spells  on  crop  production  and  livestock 

was low as established in the March 2007 rapid flood assessment.  

 

The  assessment  revealed  that  fourteen  (14)  districts  from  Luapula,  Western,  North-

western  and  Northern  Provinces  have  experienced  drastic  reduction  in  the  overall 

harvest of main staples as a result of water logging and flash floods. 

 

The assessment also revealed that input support for rural households has still remained 

inadequate  prompting  most  of  them  to  resort  to  recycled  hybrid  seed  which  are  low 

yielding. 

 

4.2 Nutrition 

The nutritional situation of children found in this survey is best described as “stable but 

precarious”,  with  a  high  likelihood  of  deterioration  if  interventions  and/or  if  basic 

services, particularly provision of clean water and health care, are reduced. Malnutrition 

levels  are  still  below  emergency  levels,  Children  under  the  age  of  three  years  are 

significantly  more  malnourished  than  children  over  three  years.  This  is  consistent  with 

localized  nutrition  surveys-  Rapid  Nutrition  assessment  2005  and  targeted  nutrition 

assessment 2006 in drought affected districts 

 

4.3.  Health 

Access to health services such as immunisation was still high during the period of the 

floods. The interventions taken to mitigate the impact of the floods were effective as 

demonstrated by the low disease prevalence among the children below five years of age, 

who were in the target group. 

 

4.4 Water and Sanitation 

From  the  findings  it  is  clear  that  the  floods  or  heavy  rains  in  the  2006/2007  season 

increased  water  availability  but  caused  wide-spread  water  contamination  especially  in 

unprotected shallow wells and surface water sources such as rivers, dams or lakes. The 

impact  on  water  quality  was  severe  during  the  rainy  season  in  areas  that  experienced 

floods  and  heavy  rainfall.  After  the  rainy  season  (during  the  survey)  the  quality  was 

reported  to  have  improved.  The  major  sources  of  drinking  water  were  borehole, 

unprotected shallow  well and  river  or lake.  Only  52%  of  households  had  access  to safe 

drinking  water.  Most  households  (77%)  do  not  treat  their  drinking  water.  Most 

households  (75%)  have  no  access  to  alternative  sources  of  safe  drinking  water  in  the 

event of floods.  

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

47 

 

The  majority  of  households  (65%)  have  access  to  improved  sanitation,  which  largely 

consists  of  traditional  latrines.  However,  a  number  of  these  latrines  are  susceptible  to 

floods  and  heavy  rainfall.  Generally,  the  level  of  hygiene  in  most  households  was 

observed to be low. Diarrhoea cases were highest in households that used traditional pit 

latrines.  Poor  hygiene  practices  could  have  also  greatly  contributed  to  high  diarrhoea 

incidences. 

 

4.5.  Education 

The  assessment  established  that  there  was  more  attendance  at  primary  school  than  at 

higher levels  of  education  in  the  assessed  districts. There  were  more  women  than men 

that  had  undergone  primary  education  but  the  situation  changed  at  secondary  school 

level  where  there  were  more  men  than  women  due  to  due  to  personal  circumstances. 

Furthermore,      the  main  reason  for  children  dropping  out  of  school  was  because  the 

families could not afford to meet their school requirements. 

 

The effect of the floods on school attendance was low because learning continued under 

alternative  arrangements  even  though  the  quality  of  education  was  poor  because  the 

alternative learning environment was not conducive. 

 

4.6. 

Infrastructure 

As  reported  in  the  Floods  Rapid  Assessment  of  March  2007,  the  In-Depth  Assessment 

confirmed the impact on roads (gravel) and bridges/culverts was severe ranging from 60 

to  100%.    The  extent  of  the  damage  is  contained  in  a  supplementary  Technical  Report 

prepared by the Roads Development Agency.  

 

The  effect  on  Health  facilities  was  low  as  there  was  minimal  damage  to  the  health 

infrastructure. The assessment established that the condition of the hospitals, clinics and 

rural health centres in the districts visited was still good.  

 

School  infrastructure  was  moderately  affected  by  the  floods.  The  community  schools 

suffered  the  most  damage  as  the  pole  and  mud  structures  at  these  schools  collapsed. 

The schools with permanent structure had minimal damage from blown off roofs. 

 

The  effect  on  other  infrastructure  such  as  boreholes,  markets,  churches/community 

halls, dip tanks and storage shed was minimal. Most of these were not damaged due to 

floods and/or prolonged dry spells but are in a poor state due to lack of maintenance.

5.0  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

5.1 Food Security  

Short term  

  The  assessment  recommends  that  fourteen  (14)  districts  (Samfya,  Mungwi, 

Mpika,  Chavuma,  Kabompo,  Mwinilunga,  Zambezi,  Kalabo,  Lukulu,  Mongu, 

Senanga,  Shangombo,  Kaputa  and  Mporokoso)  where  households  experienced 

drastic reductions in their overall harvest be targeted for relief.  Bearing in mind 

that this is just the beginning of the consumption period, there is need to provide 

31,742MT  of  cereals  for  a  total  of  440,866  persons  from  September  2007  to 

February 2008 (six months).  It is recommended that this relief be labour based 

in  nature  (food  for  work  e.g.  infrastructure  rehabilitation  in  collaboration  with 

RDA).  The  food  will  be  distributed  per  district  as  per  the  attached  distribution 

graphs in Annex 8. 

  There  is need  for  redistribution  of  the staple  food  from  surplus  areas within  and 

outside  the  district  to  non  surplus  areas  through  the  markets.  This  will  increase 

income  for  producing  households.  Market  programs  can  include  the  WFP  local 

purchase, use of FRA stocks within districts.  

Medium to long term 

  Extension  services  to  be  enhanced  and  should  include  appropriate  Dambo 

utilization interventions bearing in mind that these are fragile environments 

  Support for small scale irrigation systems be provided to targeted rural population 

with  access  to  streams  and  dambos.  This  will  improve  their  productivity  in 

vegetable gardening as well as well as production of other winter crops like maize  

  Enhanced  sensitisation  of  farmers  in  good  livestock  husbandry  practices, 

improved extension services and enhanced livestock disease surveillance system. 

  There is need for crop diversification and promotion of growing and consumption 

of  cassava,  sorghum,  millet  in  areas  that  predominantly  grow  maize  especially 

low  producing  areas.  In  addition,  the  non  cereal  crops  such  as  cowpeas  should 

also be considered. 

 

 

 

 

 

5.2 Nutrition 

Medium to Long-term 

 Programmes  aiming  to  reduce  and/or  prevent  malnutrition  must  focus  on  increasing 

access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation,  and  reducing  disease  incidence,  particularly 

Fever/malaria, respiratory infections and diarrhoea. 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

49 

 

 Health and hygiene promotion should be strengthened to include all populations, 

supported  by  provision  of appropriate  non-food  items such  as  mosquito  nets  etc 

where necessary. 

 

 Food  assistance  also  plays  a  vital  role  in  ensuring  good  health  and  nutrition 

status, and should be continued for those who are food insecure. 

  Nutrition  programmes  should  focus  mostly  on  children  under  the  age  of  three 

years, since this is where the majority of acute malnutrition is found. 

 

 Caring  practices  are  a  key  factor  in  young  child  nutrition  and  health  status: 

exclusive  breastfeeding  must  be  promoted  and  fully  explained  to  mothers  and 

midwives as a key starting point 

 

 Routine  immunizations  and  supplementation  of  vitamin  A  for  all  children  should 

be  strengthened,  and  health  clinics  supported  to  provide  these  vital  services. 

Campaigns to maintain  high levels of measles and polio  immunization are also a 

necessary strategy. 

 

 Outreach  and  early  case  finding  of  malnourished  children  in  the  communities 

should  be  strengthened  where  possible,  to  improve  coverage  of  therapeutic 

feeding programmes. 

  Supplementary  feeding  programmes  should  focus  more  on  education  for 

caretakers,  and  be  used  as  an  opportunity  to  raise  awareness  of  appropriate 

health, hygiene and caring practices, rather than simply a distribution of food 

  Routine surveillance activities should be strengthened to allow early detection  of 

changes in nutrition and health status, and to remove the need for large surveys 

such  as  this.  Such  surveillance  systems  should  be  integrated  into  government 

structures and include food security monitoring indicators as well. 

  Support  the  mitigation  of  nutritional  impact  of  floods  on  health  especially  the 

under five children 

 

5.3  Health 

 

Short-term 

  Intensify  information,  education  and  communication  to  mitigate  any  possible 

outbreak of communicable diseases 

  Continue  monitoring  of  disease  patterns  as  some  effects  can  appear  after  the 

floods. 

 

Medium to Long Term 

  Support the provision and distribution of essential drugs and supplies for malaria, 

diarrhoea and coughs/ARI through programmes  

  Scaling  up  of  programmes  such  as  Roll  Back  Malaria  and  Domestic  Water 

Chlorination Promotion in all districts. 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

50 

  Support  sustained  delivery  of  essential  health  services  such  as  immunization, 

child  growth  monitoring,  maternity,  HIV/AIDS,  TB  including  through  outreach 

where appropriate. 

  Support integrated disease surveillance and reporting (IDSR), especially measles 

and other common illnesses. 

  Intensification  of  community  sensitization  on  good  hygiene  practice  e.g.  waste 

disposal. 

  Primary  health  indicators  generated  by  HMIS  should  be  overlayed  with 

environmental  predictors  such  as  temperature,  rainfall  etc  in  order  to  provide  a 

comprehensive  secondary  analysis  that  could  be  used  for  epidermic  forecasting 

and preparedness at district level. 

 

5.4.  Water and Sanitation 

 

 

 

5.4.1.  Water: 

Short-term 

  Intensify community sensitisation and participation in water programmes such as 

treatment and protection of water sources through D-WASHE programmes 

  Increase availability and affordability of chlorine (as chlorin) in collaboration with 

MoH under the Domestic Water Chlorination Promotion.  

 

Medium to long term 

  Increase  access  to  safe  drinking  water  by  constructing  water  facilities  such  as 

boreholes  and  dams  especially  in  areas  with  poor  access  to  safe  water  such  as 

Northern 

(Mpika,  Luwingu,  Chinsali, 

Isoka,  Mporokoso),  North-western 

(Mwinilunga,  Zambezi,  Chavuma,  Kabompo)  and  Western  Province  (Kalabo  and 

Shangombo). 

  Promote rainwater harvesting facilities and spring utilisation to improve access to 

safe drinking water. 

  Strengthening and institutionalisation of WASHE programmes in all districts. 

         

5.4.2.  Sanitation: 

 

Short-term 

  Intensify  community  sensitisation  and  participation  in  sanitation  programmes. 

This should be an on going programme. 

  Promote  and  encourage  construction  of  strong  and  recommended  structures  for 

sanitary or excreta disposal  in areas with no access to improved sanitation such 

as    Southern  (Gwembe,  Kazungula,  Namwala,  Sinazongwe),  Eastern  (Lundazi, 

Nyimba),   Central (Chibombo) and Western (Kalabo)   

 

Medium to long term 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee - 2007 

51 

  Increase awareness of household and personal hygiene and promote behavioural 

change initiatives 

  Formulation  and  enforcing  of  policies  that  promote  construction  of  strong  and 

recommended structures for sanitary or excreta disposal 

  Strengthening and institutionalisation of WASHE programmes in all districts 

 

5.5. 

Infrastructure 

5.5.1. Roads and Bridges/Culverts 

Short-term: 

  Refer  to  the  In-depth  Report  on  the  Washed  Away  and  Affected  Drainage 

Structures by the 2006/7 Heavy Rains, RDA, July 2007 

  

 

 

5.5.2 Schools 

Short-term 

  Repair school infrastructure with blown off roofs 

 

       Medium-term 

  Rehabilitate  school infrastructure which was  damaged as a result of floods 

 

        Long-term 

  Reconstruct    schools  which  collapsed  due  to  the  floods  including  community 

schools     

 

5.5.3 Habitation (houses) 

Short-term 

  Community sensitization programs to build durable houses 

 

 

Medium-term 

  Community  sensitization  programs  to  help  households  in  flood  prone  areas  to 

appreciate the need to relocate to non flood prone areas. 

 

5.6 General Recommendation 

Short- term 

  There  is  still  need  for  ZVAC  to  carry  out  a  Comprehensive  Vulnerability 

Assessment and Analysis to establish baseline information that will not only help 

in  disaster  preparedness  but  also  in  designing  relief  and  social  protection 

interventions.  This  will  help  distinguish  between  the  chronic  and  transitory  food 

insecure areas.
