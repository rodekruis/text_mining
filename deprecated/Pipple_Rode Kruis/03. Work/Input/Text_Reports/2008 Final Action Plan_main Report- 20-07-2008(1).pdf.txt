EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
The  Zambia  Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee  (ZVAC)  undertook  the  In-Depth 

Vulnerability  and  Needs  Assessment  in  thirty-nine  (39)  districts.  The  assessment 

report  recommended  key  interventions  necessary  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  floods 

and /or water logging in the affected districts.  

 

In  order  to  ensure  speedy  implementation  of  these  recommendations,  it  became 

necessary to translate the recommendations into a Recovery Action Plan with specific 

activities and the costing. 

 

This Recovery Action Plan should therefore be seen as a follow up document on the 

In-Depth  Vulnerability  and  Needs  Assessment  report  aimed  at  rationalising  the 

implementation of recommendations of the report. 

 

The  document  starts  with  an  introduction  that  discusses  the  structure  and 

management of the Recovery Action Plan. 

 

Required sector specific interventions and costing are discussed focussing on Health 

and  Nutrition,  Water  and  Sanitation,  Agriculture  and  Food  Security,  Infrastructure, 

Human Settlement and Shelter and Education. 

 

It  is  important  to  note  that  recommended  interventions  reflect  sectoral  needs  in 

short, medium and long-term perspectives. 

In specific terms the summary of the financial requirements per sector is reflected in 

the table below:

Implementation  of  the  action  plan  is  to  be  done  with  full  participation  of  all 

stakeholders  such  as  relevant  Government  agencies,  donors,  UN  System,  private 

sector and NGOs.  

NGOs  in  conjunction  with  the  district  and  satellite  committees  will  be  the  front  line 

implementers at the district level.  

Timeframe  for  the  implementation  of  interventions  is  projected  to  be  twelve  (12) 

months. 

The  Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Unit  (DMMU)  will  spearhead  coordination 

and  monitoring  of  implementation  of  the  action  plan  with  the  support  of  the  core 

coordination team, drawing membership from Government, UN, and NGO agencies. 

Monitoring and evaluation of the Recovery Action Plan will be based on sector specific 

performance indicators that form part of this action plan document.

1.0  INTRODUCTION 
 
The  2007/08  rainy  season  started  on  a  good  note  with  the  southern  half  of  the 

country  experiencing  an  early  onset  while  the  extreme  northern  parts  had  a  late 

onset.  From  the  month  of  November  2007  to  January  2008,  the  rainfall  activity 

increased  substantially  in  the  southern  half  of  the  country  resulting  in  widespread 

heavy rains. 

The desktop analysis of the dekadal rainfall for the period November 2007 to January 

2008 revealed that this year’s rainfall performance has proved to be in excess of last 

year’s  (2006/07  season)  with  most  southern  half  of  the  country  (Western,  Eastern 

and  Southern  provinces)  experiencing  severe  flash  floods  in  low  lying  areas 

(Luangwa  and  Zambezi  Rift  Valleys)  and  water  logging in  the  central, southern  and 

western plateaus.  

The Rapid Assessment conducted in February 2008 established that the floods and / 

water logging resulted into destruction of crops and damage of infrastructure such as 

bridges,  culverts,  habitations,  school  buildings  and  health  centres.  It  was  evident 

from the rapid assessment that in most of the districts where infrastructure damage 

was  prominent,  easy  access  to  basic  services  such  as  health,  schools  and  markets 

had been hampered.  

In  view  of  the  varying  impact  of  floods/water  logging  on  different  sectors  and  the 

inability  to  access  some  affected  areas  at  the  time  of  the  rapid  assessment,  the 

Zambia  Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee  (ZVAC)  undertook  an  In-depth 

Vulnerability and Needs assessment in thirty-nine (39) districts.  

In  order  to  ensure  a  speedy  and  coordinated  response,  the  Government  of  the 

Republic of Zambia decided to put this document with annexes from 1 to 8 in place.  

 

The  document  will  act  as  the  general  framework  within  which  all  stakeholders  will 

undertake  all  interventions  related  to  floods.    The  plan  defines  the  scale  of  the 

problem and the rationale for the implementation of the recommended interventions. 

It brings out the general response strategy and outlines sector based interventions in 

short and medium to long-term perspectives. Implementation, reporting, monitoring 

and coordination arrangements are also spelt out.

2.0. SCALE OF THE PROBLEM 
 
Zambia  is  one  of  the  countries  in  the  Southern  African  Development  Community 

(SADC)  sub-region  which  have  been  negatively  affected  by  the  floods  resulting  in 

damage  to  Infrastructure  mainly  Roads,  Culverts  and  Bridges  as  well  as  Crops.  The 

floods  and/or  water  logging  exposed  the  affected  Population  to  the  risk  of  outbreak 

of  waterborne  diseases  and increased  the  likelihood  of  animal  disease  incidences  to 

rise.  The  damage  to  crops  created  food  insecurity  problems  in  thirty-nine  (39) 

Districts in  all  the  nine (9)  Provinces.  In  order  to  mitigate  the impact of  the  floods, 

Government will need to implement short to medium and long-term interventions in 

all the eight (8) sectors identified to have been affected.  

 
 
3.0  RATIONALE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDED 

INTERVENTIONS 
 

The  2007/08  rainfall  was  generally  heavy  resulting  in  floods  and  water  logging  in 

valley  and/or  low  lying  areas.    The  floods  and/or  water  logging  caused  varying 

impacts on a number of sectors (Infrastructure and Habitations, Agriculture and Food 

Security, Education, Health, Nutrition and Water and Sanitation.   

 

In  order  to  address  the  negative  impact  of  the  floods  the  Government  should  as  a 

matter  of  urgency  implement  sector  specific  interventions  which  range  from  those 

addressing  short  term  needs  to  those  that  seek  to  address  medium  to  long  term 

needs.  The  implementation  of  the  recommended  interventions  will  help  open  up 

places  that  were  cut  off  due  to  damage  to  infrastructure,  thus  effectively  restoring 

the movement of people. The interventions will further help mitigate other negative 

effects in the identified sectors, maintain economic viability and reduce if not prevent 

increase in the levels of malnutrition among affected communities.  

 

 
4.0    GENERAL RESPONSE STRATEGY 

 

To  ensure  that  the  recommended  interventions  achieve  their  objectives,  the 

government’s  strategy  is  to  mobilize  all  available  human,  financial  and  material 

resources  and  redirect  these  to  areas  that  were  affected  areas.  This  strategy  also 

entails  cooperate  approach  by 

involving  all  relevant  Government,  Donor 

community,  UN  System,  Private  sector  and  NGOs  agencies  (both  local  and 

international).

 5.0      REQUIRED INTERVENTIONS 

 

As  reflected  in  the  floods  In-Depth  Vulnerability  and  Needs  Assessment  report,  the 

required interventions involve eight (8) sectors with activities ranging from those of 

short  to  medium  and  long  term.  The  main  sectors  involved  are  those  that  the 

assessment established as having been severely affected by the floods.  

 

These  are  Health  and  Nutrition,  Water  and  Sanitation,  Infrastructure,  Human 

settlement and Shelter, Education, Agriculture and Food Security. 

 

It is important to note that there is some level of response going on in each of these 

sectors. This level of response however, falls short of meeting the demands/needs in 

the  floods  affected  districts.    What  is  required  therefore  is  the  scaling  up  of  the 

interventions so as to make them more effective and responsive to the needs of the 

floods affected districts.  

In  specific  terms  the  required  interventions  are  as  summarised  in  the  sector  by 

activity table below:

6.0    IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 

 

In  order  to  ensure  maximum  participation  of  all  stakeholders  and  at  the  same  time 

ensure  that  Portfolio  institutions  and  agencies  take  up  their  responsibilities  as  we 

scale-up  the  operation,  the  affected  sectors  in  conjunction  with  relevant  UN,  NGO 

and  Private  sector  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  their 

activities based on the sector needs as per attached sector specific annexes. Satellite 

Disaster  Management  Committees  in  conjunction  with  NGOs  will  be  front  line 

implementers  while  District  Disaster  Management  Committees  will  be  the  overall 

district supervisors. 

 
 
6.1 
 
As mentioned earlier, it is important to recognize that a lot has already been 

Current level of response 

done  by  Government  in  collaboration  with  its  co-operating  partners  in  terms 

of response interventions.   

 

The  implementation  of  this  action  plan  should  therefore  be  seen  within  the 

context  of  scaling  up  of  the  existing  interventions  based  on  the  February, 

2008  Rapid  Assessment  and  not  necessarily  kick-starting  of  the  recovery 

operation. 

 

6.2 

Scaling Up 

 In  order  to  scale  up  the  level  of  current  response  and  make  the  operation 

more  effective  and  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  affected  populations,  it  is 

important 

that 

the  sector-based 

interventions  are 

implemented  as 

recommended (see annexes 1 to 8 for more details).

7.0    ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
It  is  expected  that  the  major  stakeholders  like  the  Ministries  of  Health,  Education, 

Agriculture,  Works  and  Supply,  Finance  and  Donor  community,  the  UN  system, 

Private sector including NGOs both local and international will play an important role 

to  ensure  that  the  planned  programmes  are  timely  and  efficiently  implemented  in 

order  for  the  programme  to  be  effective  and  responsive  enough  to  achieve  the 

programme  objectives.  Each  Ministry/Department  will  nominate  a  dedicated  officer 

who will be part of the coordination core team to overseer the implementation of the 

recommended 

interventions. 

  Satellite  Disaster  Management  Committees 

in 

conjunction with NGOs will be the front line implementers of the interventions while 

District  Disaster  Management  Committees  (DDMC)  will  have  the  district  overall 

supervisory responsibilities.  

  
8.0    TIMEFRAME 
 
The  implementation  of  the  activities  will  be  done  within  twelve  (12)  months.  This 

period  will  cover  the  implementation  of  short  to  medium  and  some  long-term 

interventions. 

 

9.0    REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS 

All implementing agencies will generate progress reports and submit them to DMMU 

through  the  National  Coordinator  on  monthly  basis.    DMMU  will  in  turn  consolidate 

the  sector  reports  in  one  document  and  submit  it  to  Government  and  other 

stakeholders for decision-making and information sharing. 

 

10.0   COORDINATION 

 

The  coordination  of  the  implementation  of  the  rehabilitation  plan  (short  to  medium 

and  long  term)  will  be  spearheaded  by  DMMU  supported  by  the  Coordination  Core 

Team with representation from Government, Donors, UN system, private sector and 

NGOs.  

 
11.0   MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
 

Monitoring of the implementation of interventions will be based on the indicators as 

brought  out  in  the  monitoring  and  valuation  indicators  table  and  will  be  done  at 

different  levels  namely:  through  reports,  field  trips  involving  a  combined  team  of 

main stakeholders  or individual institutions and organizations. Political leadership at 

 

6 

national,  provincial  and  local levels  will  be  critical in  ensuring  that  the  objectives  of 

this recovery action plan are achieved in line with its rationale. 

  

Effectiveness of the interventions will be evaluated in terms of outcomes and impact 

on  the  target  population  and  districts.  A  final impact  assessment  will be  conducted. 

The  report will be presented to  Government and shared with other stakeholders for 

important reflections on the response and recovery programme.

ANNEXES 
 
Annex 1: Health and Nutrition 
 

Floods  are  likely  to  cause  numerous  health  problems  in  the  country.  An  anticipated 

increase  in  waterborne  diseases  and  diseases  related  to  overcrowding  is  inevitable.  The 

broad health sector challenges include the following: 

 

•  Disruption of health services such as inaccessible health facilities and the resulting 

surge  in  demand  at  other  service  delivery  points  is  likely  to  result  in  shortages  of 

essential medicines/supplies and overburdened health staff.  

  

•  Cross-contamination  of  drinking  water  sources  and  faecal  disposal  facilities  may 

result in epidemics of diarrhoeal diseases such as Cholera and Dysentery. 

 

•  Overcrowding of displaced people in their places of resettlement is likely to lead to 

Respiratory  Tract  Infections  and  outbreak  of  immunizable  diseases  especially 

Measles.  

•  Pooling  of  water  leading  to  an  increase  in  the  mosquito  breeding  places  and  a 

possible increase in cases of Malaria especially after the flood water recedes.  

•  The  displaced  people  in  particular,  women  and  children,  are  likely  to  miss  their 

immunisation  schedules  leaving  them  vulnerable  to  contracting  preventable 

diseases  including  those  from  contacts  displaced  from  neighbouring  countries  and; 

are likely to walk long distances in search of safe and clean water.  

 

•  Resultant  household  food  insecurity  will  lead  to  malnutrition  and  increased 

susceptibility to infectious and immunizable diseases such as measles. 

  

           Activities 

The mitigation measures for Health and Nutrition fall under the broad categories as shown 

in table1 below.

Target 
 
This plan targets the districts moderately or severely affected by floods. The classification is based 

on  reports  sent  to  DMMU,  field  reports,  key  informant  interviews  and  the  in-depth  vulnerability 

assessment.  

 

Implementing Agency 

 

The Ministry of Health and its various Cooperating partners in the sectors will implement this plan. 

 
Annex 2:  Water and Sanitation 
 
Problem Statement and Rationale 
 

Floods  are  likely  to  cause  numerous  health  problems  in  the  country.  An  anticipated  increase  in 

waterborne  diseases  and  diseases  related  to  overcrowding  is  inevitable.  Most  of  the  water  wells 

submerged  and  some  of  the  water  points  had  their  walls  collapsed.  The  communities  move  to 

higher dry grounds that have no provision of safe clean water. The sources of safe water are very 

far  from  the  current  locations  where  the  displaced  people  have  moved.  It  will  be  inevitable  to 

provide protected sources to new places so that these are made permanent dwellings. The areas 

that are flooded and whose water points can be sustained later after the floods have rescinded. All 

the boreholes will be equipped with Indian Mark II Hand pumps. The drilling and costing of each 

borehole varies from one province to the other due to different types of drilling methods and cost 

of fuel.  

 

The broad health sector challenges include the following: 

 

 

•  Cross-contamination  of  drinking  water  sources  and  faecal  disposal  facilities  may  result  in 

epidemics of diarrhoeal diseases such as Cholera and Dysentery. 

 

•  Pooling  of  water  leading  to  an  increase  in  the  mosquito  breeding  places  and  a  possible 

increase in cases of Malaria especially after the flood water recedes.  

•  Pooling  of  water  leading  to  an  increase  in  the  groundwater  contamination  in  the  areas  of 

high infiltration rates.  

•  The  displaced  people  in  particular,  women  and  children,  are  likely  to  miss  their 

immunization  schedules  leaving  them  vulnerable  to  contracting  preventable  diseases 

including those from contacts displaced from neighbouring countries and; are likely to walk 

long distances in search of safe and clean water. 

 

Activities 

The  mitigation  measures  for  Water  &  Sanitation  will  fall  under  the  following  broad  categories  as 

shown  in  the  Water  and  Sanitation  below  table.  The  sector  will  address  household  level  and 

community water safety and awareness rising on waste disposal.  

 

SECTOR 
Water

and 

of 

to 

affected 

communities                   

safe  water 

(boreholes)  and  sanitation 

ACTIVITY 
Water and Sanitation 
Provision 
(Household Chlorine, HTH Chlorine)  
Provision  of  water 
infrastructure (rehabilitation and sinking/digging of new ones) 
Provision  of  water  storage  containers,  soap  and  hand  washing 
facilities. 
Training: 
Hygiene promoters and V-WASHE committees 
Water quality monitoring, proper usage of home chlorination and 
HTH,  management  of  water  and  sanitation  facilities  and  safe 
excreta disposal. 
Proper garbage handling and disposal 
Monitoring and Evaluation 

(latrines) 

  

The activities will include supply of chlorine for treatment of domestic water and granular chlorine 
for  communal  water  sources  to  the  identified  districts  (39),  strengthen  community  sensitization 
programmes on public health and hygiene, drilling of boreholes to ensure access to safe drinking 
water and promotion of construction of adequate sanitary facilities. 
 
Implementing Agencies 
 

•  Ministry of Local Government and Housing 
•  Ministry of Energy and Water Development 
•  Ministry of Health 
•  Cooperating Partners 
•  Private Sector 
•  Non Governmental Organizations

Annex 3: Infrastructure 
 
Problem Statement and Rationale:  

 

Road  infrastructure,  such  as  embankments,  bridges  and  culverts,  has  been 

damaged in some parts of the country due to  heavy rains. The hardest hit areas 

are  the  Eastern,  Southern,  Lusaka,  Western  and  Northern  parts  of  the  country 

that  received  above  normal  rains.  This  has  impacted  negatively  on  the  social 

service delivery and economic development. 

 

There  is  therefore  need  to  carryout  urgent  reinstatements  to  the  affected  road 

infrastructure in order to ensure that: 

•  Access  to  health  centers,  schools, market  places  and  agricultural  areas  is   

restored; 

•  The  much-needed 

relief  supplies  are  delivered 

to 

the  affected 

communities.  

 

Activities  

 

The proposed intervention measures are outlined below: 

• 

Installation of washed away pipe and box culverts; 

•  Reinstatement of washed/eroded embankments and stone pitching; 

•  Replacement of rotten timber bridge decks; 

•  Reinforcing the existing bridge decks; 

•  Reinstatement of washed away bridges with permanent structures; 

•  Provision of concrete drift on top of approaches to allow for overtopping;  

•  Heavy dredging works using plant machinery for the construction of channels. 

 

Target  

The target is to reinstate the following infrastructure in fifty six (56) districts:  

•  Twenty Seven (27) Bridges;  

•  One hundred and Eight Seven  (187) Culverts; 

•  Fourteen (14) Embankment structures; and 

•  Five (05) road sections that have experienced severe erosion.

Education 

Annex 4:  
 
Problem statement and rationale 

Reference  is  made  to  the  2007/2008  heavy  rains,  which  have  caused  floods  in  the  9 

Provinces  of  Zambia  and  had  adverse  effects  on  the  people  and  infrastructure.  The 

Education Sector as expected was not spared from the consequences of the floods. Arising 

from  that,  School  Infrastructure  was  submerged  and  damaged  resulting  in  some  schools 

being closed or operating at half capacity. This meant that the pupils and teachers were not 

able to access schools.   

 

 

The Ministry of Education has assessed the impact of the floods and prioritised interventions 

as  medium  and  long  term  to  enable  the  pupils  and  teachers  to  continue  learning  and 

teaching, respectively.

Protection 

Annex 5:  
 
Problem statement and rationale 
 
The affected communities moved to higher dry grounds that have no provision of safe clean 

water nearby, medical services and psychosocial support systems. The sources of safe water 

are  very  far  from  the  current  locations  where  the  displaced  people  have  moved.  It  will  be 

inevitable  to  provide  protected  sources  to  new  places  so  that  these  are  made  permanent 

dwellings to ensure protection of children and women. The areas that are flooded and whose 

water points can be sustained later after the floods have rescinded.   

 

The broad sector challenges include the following: 

•  Lack of doctors to sign on forensic examination forms in case of defilement or sexual 

abuse of children and women 

•  Lack  of  access  to  constitutional  legal  systems  that  will  expedite  cases  of  physical, 

sexual and emotional abuse of children and women 

•  The  displaced  people  in  particular,  children  are  likely  to  miss  their  school  activities 

leaving them vulnerable to child labour; are likely to walk long distances in search of 

safe and clean water. 

Activities 

The  mitigation  measures  for  the  Protection  sector  will  address  family level  and  community 

level safety (prevention), capacity building and awareness raising on children’s and women’s 

rights.  

 

The activities to be undertaken under the protection  sector will include; awareness raising 

on  the  code  of  conduct  for  humanitarian  workers  and  all  relevant  stakeholders  to  be 

identified  in  the  39  districts,  strengthening  community  sensitization  and  service  provision 

programmes  on  defilement  and  sexual  abuse  of  children  and  women,  provision  of 

professional  psychosocial  services  to  victims  of  defilement,  sexual  and  physical  abuse  as 

well as emotional support to  caregivers due to the  stressful environment care givers  could 

be  exposed  to.  Additionally,  the  Protection  sector  will  promote  establishment  of  child 

friendly spaces.

Annex 6:  Agriculture 

 

Problem Statement and Rationale 

 

The  major  impact  of  the  floods  has  been  on  crop  production  (maize),  pre-disposition  of 

cattle  to  Foot  and  Mouth  disease  (FMD)  and  the  destruction  of  agricultural  roads  (feeder 

roads), making transportation of agricultural produce difficult.  In comparison to last year’s 

production, floods resulted in reduced maize production ranging from 24.1 % (Sesheke) to 

85.1%  (Sinazongwe)  in  the  21  most  affected  of  the  39  assessed  districts  (Table  1).  

Southern province bore the blunt of the flood impact on agriculture and food security with 9 

out  of  the  11  districts  recording  reductions  in  production.  Country  wide,  the  assessments 

have indicated that a total of 444,624 people representing 74,104 Households (HHs) in the 

21 districts will require assistance until the next harvest.  The in depth vulnerability survey 

indicates that three quarters (55,578) of the flood affected HHs were dependant on farming. 

 

Loss  of  crops  due  to  floods  will  reduce  the  capacity  of  farmers  to  purchase  inputs  such  as 

seed  and  fertilizers  for  the  coming  planting  season.  This  situation  is  likely  to  be  further 

aggravated  by  the  rising  cost  of  agricultural  commodity  prices  such  agricultural  inputs  on 

the local market. Most affected farmers will thus not be able to access the yield enhancing 

technologies that are necessary for increased crop productivity and production. 

 

There is therefore need to restore the production capacity of affected farmers through input 

and agricultural extension support.  Government is likely to provide support to a projected 

200,000 beneficiaries under the Fertiliser Support  Programme (FSP) and 20,000 under the 

Food  Security  Pack  programme  (FSP)  during  the  2008/09  cropping  season.  It  is  expected 

that  70%  of  flood  affected  households  will  access  input  support  from  the  two  FSP 

programmes.  The  remaining  30%  (16,674  HHs)  would  require  urgent  input  support  to  be 

able to cultivate one lima of maize and legume. 

 

The  outbreak  of  FMD  during  floods  in  Namwala,  Mazabuka,  Monze,  Choma,  Senanga  and 

Mongu  poses  a  major  risk  to  people  livelihood  in  the  affected  provinces.  The  livestock 

movement  ban  means  that  flood  affected  households  that  are  dependent  on  livestock 

production  have  no  alternative  sources  of  income,  thus  reducing  the  available  coping 

strategies. So far, the Zambian Government has procured the FMD vaccine and vaccinated 

 

38 

most  of  cattle  in  affected  areas.  FAO  has  provided  support  to  complimented  government 

efforts for vaccinations and surveillance.

Occurrence of floods and drought has been linked to climate change. These climatic shocks 

are likely to be more frequent in future. There is therefore need to increase the capacity of 

affected households to be more resilient to the effects of floods and drought in the high risk 

areas. Recovery interventions should therefore ensure the integration of this aspect in non 

food assistance. Conservation Agriculture (CA) which involves the adoption of a package of 

agronomic  practices  covering  minimum  tillage,    early  planting,  incorporation  of  legume 

rotations,  precise  input  application  ,  retention  of  at  least  30%  crop  residues  and  effective 

weed control have been found to minimize the impact  of climatic shocks. The integration of 

small  livestock  (chickens  and  goats  etc)  in  the  farming  systems  of  households  in  high  risk 

 

39 

areas  increases  coping  strategies  available  for  the  farmers  and  spreads  climate  change 

related risks.  

 

Plan of Activities 
As  part  of  the  flood  recovery  plan  a  recovery  matrix  covering  the  following  activities  are 

recommended to be undertaken. 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Control  of  Foot  and  Mouth  Disease  in  districts  affected  by  floods  in  Southern, 

Northern  and  Western  province  through  vaccinations  and  training  of  district 

Veterinary Staff in Trans-boundary Animal Diseases (TADs).   

 

•  Production  capacity  restoration  through  input  support  to  main  season  cropping 

corresponding to 1 Lima (0.25 Ha) per HHs to 30% (16,674) of affected Households. 

•  Support  to  building  of  capacity  in  Conservation  Agriculture  to  5000  of  the  affected 

HHs  so  as  to  increase  adaptation  and  resilience  to  climatic  changes  in  high  risk 

areas. 

 

•  Capacity  building  for  MACO  at  various  levels  to  provide  timely  agricultural  and  food 

security information to VAC/DMMU for disaster preparedness, response and recovery. 

•  Enhancement  of  coordination  and  linkages  between  VAC  and  MACO  through 

employment of liaison staff. 

•  Livelihood  support  such  as  provision  of  small livestock  to  increase  coping  strategies 

to 4,000 flood affected HHs.

Annex7: Human Settlement and Shelter 
 
   
Problem Statement and Rationale 

 

During the 2007/08 floods, the rural areas were the most affected mainly due to high vulnerability as a 

result of the combined factors regarding the poor location of settlements being in the flood prone areas 

coupled  with  the  inappropriate  and  weak  building  materials,  which  are  mainly  pole,  mud  and  grass, 

used in building the shelters.  

 

The  impact  of floods  on  human  settlements  was low in terms  of  number  of  households  affected  while 

the impact on individual households affected was critical.  Other effects of the floods on the displaced 

households  were  loss  of  livelihood  sources,  hunger  and  disease,  lack  of  access  to  basic  services  like 

clean drinking water, health and education.    

  

In  view  of  the  foregoing,  there  is  need  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  and  impact  of  floods  by  realigning 

the  settlement  patterns  of  low-lying  areas  prone  to  flooding  and  relocate  them  to  higher  and  safer 

lands. There is also need to sensitise the communities to BUILD BETTER ON SAFER LANDS. Sustainable 

settlement  planning  and  management  (at  local  level)  may  be  the  durable  option  to  saving  costs  on 

relief and rehabilitation. 

 

Plan of Activities 

 

1.  Consultations  with 

local 

leadership  (traditional  rulers  and  district  administration)  on 

identification of safer lands and the concept of building better on safer land. 

 

2.  Identify  and  or  acquire  higher  and  safer  lands  to  relocate  the  displaced  population  from  low-

lying flood prone areas. 

 

3.  Carry out a survey among the concerned communities to determine their willingness to relocate 

to  such  higher  lands  once  the  land  is  acquired  and  educate  them  on  the  possible  alternative 

livelihood sources (especially farming) in the new settlement.  

 

4.  Site preparation of the new settlement:-  

a)  Plot demarcation 

b)  road clearing where necessary 

c)  borehole drilling 

d)  plot allocation 

e)  resettling of the new settlers

Phase I Targets  

 

In  pahse1,  districts  along  the  Zambezi  River  catchment  are  targeted  under  severely  impacted 

districts.  All  the  communities  settled  in  flood  prone  areas  will  be  targeted  for  resettling  to 

nearby higher lands. The districts targeted are: - 

i. 

ii. 

iii. 

iv. 

Kazungula 

Chavuma 

Zambezi 

Lukulu 

v. 

Senanga 

vi. 

Kalabo 

vii. 

Sinazongwe 

 

Phase II Targets 
 

Under this phase, the Kafue and Ngwezi River catchments are targeted as well as Shangombo. 

The districts targeted are: - 

i. 

Kafue 

ii.  Mazabuka 

iii. 

iv. 

Namwala 

Itezhi-tezhi 

v. 

Shangombo 

Implementing Agency 

  Department  of  Resettlement  (With  cooperation  of  Department  of  Physical 

Planning and Housing, UN-HABITAT, IOM, District Councils, Red cross, etc) 

  Office of the Vice President-DMMU to coordinate the implementation. 

Financial Requirement: 

 

An estimated budget total of K1, 456,100,000 is required to undertake these activities in both phases 
one and two to be implemented.

Annex 8:  Relief Food 
 
Problem Statement and Rationale 

The  floods  of  2006/08  season  have  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  lives  of  affected  communities. 

According  to  the  In-  depth  Vulnerability  and  Needs  Assessment  on  the  impact  of  floods  and/or 

prolonged  dry  spells  conducted  by  the  VAC  in  2008,  heavy  rains  and  floods  have  severely  affected 

small  scale  farmers’  crops  in  21  namely;  Chibombo,  Choma,  Chongwe,  Gwembe,  Itezhi-Tezhi,  Kafue, 

Kalabo,  Kalomo,  Kapiri  Mposhi,  Kazungula,  Luangwa,  Mazabuka,  Monze,  Milenge,  Ndola,  Namwala, 

Serenje, Sesheke, Shangombo, Siavonga and Sinazongwe. Specifically for the agriculture sector, floods 

and water logging impacted adversely on staple crops (maize, millet, sorghum, and cassava) followed 

by livestock, cash crops (rice, soya beans and groundnuts), aquaculture (flooded fish ponds) and finally 

wildlife being marginally affected.   

 

Considering  the  wide  spread  negative  impact  of  excessive  rains  and  floods,  there  is  need  to  urgently 

address the resultant problems with specific interventions that will mitigate the effects of loss of crops, 

food  and  assets  of  the  affected  households.  Interventions  that  include  relief  food,  provision  of 

agricultural inputs and vaccinating livestock will help address the core  problems in the short, medium 

to long term. 

 

Activities 

The following three activities should be undertaken to mitigate the negative impact of heavy rains and 

floods  on  food  security  in  the  severely  affected  districts  mentioned  above.  These  activities  are 

procurement, transportation and distribution of relief food   

 

Target 

A  total  of  444,624  people  in  twenty-one  (21)  affected  districts  mentioned  above  will  be  targeted  for 

relief food.  

 

Implementing Agencies 

Office of the Vice President as well as relevant NGOs and cooperating partners. 

 

Financial Requirements 

A total of K44, 979,854,220.00 will be needed to implement the activities as reflected in the activity 

matrix below:
