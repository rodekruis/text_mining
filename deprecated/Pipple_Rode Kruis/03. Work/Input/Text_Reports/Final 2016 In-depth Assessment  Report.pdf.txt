EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The  2015/2016  strong  El  Nino  event  classified  as  one  of  the  worst  in  the  last  fifty  (50) 
years  resulted  in  significant  rainfall  reduction  in  the  southern  half  of  the  country 
impacting negatively on water supply and crop condition.  The situation was exacerbated 
by the fact  that  it followed a previous  year of erratic rainfall in  the southern half of the 
country.  This prompted the Zambia Vulnerability and Assessment committee to conduct 
an In-depth Vulnerability and Needs assessment to determine the impact of prolonged dry 
spells  on  selected  sectors  of 
(42)  districts  of 
Central(Chibombo,  Chisamba,  Luano),  Eastern(Chadiza,  Mambwe,  Nyimba,  Petauke, 
Vubwi),  Lusaka(Chongwe,  Chirundu,  Kafue,  Luangwa,  Rufunsa,  Shibuyunji), 
Southern(Choma,  Chikankata,  Gwembe,  Kalomo,  Kazungula,  Mazabuka,  Monze, 
Namwala,  Sinazongwe,  Pemba,  Siavonga,  Zimba)  and  Western(Kalabo,  Mwandi, 
Senanga, Sesheke, Shangombo,  Nalolo,  Sikongo, Sioma,  Mulobezi,  Limulunga, Kaoma, 
Nkeyema,  Luampa,  Mitete,  Lukulu.  Mongu)  Provinces.    This  assessment  was  mainly 
rural based with 92 percent of the households residing there.  

the  economy 

in 

forty-two 

The  assessment  showed  that  50  percent  of  the  assessed  households  were  female  headed 
households. Further, the results established that the main livelihoods of the people in the 
assessed  districts  were  farming  (crop  and  livestock  production).  Other  livelihoods 
mentioned were trading, fishing, formal employment and agriculture labour. 

On the overall maize production, the assessment established a reduction of 34 percent in 
the  assessed  districts.  The  highest  decline  was  observed  in  Southern  Province  while  the 
least  was  in  Western  Province.  In  terms  of  districts,  Luangwa  had  the  highest  with  83 
percent  while  6  districts  in  Western  Province  recorded  an  increase  in  production 
compared  to  the  2014/15  production  which  in  retrospect  was  also  not  a  good  season. 
Further,  results  showed  that  93  percent  of  the  assessed  households  indicated  that 
household own produced stocks will last for 6 months. Out of this, 62 percent indicated 
that stocks will last for 3 months or less. The results showed that there will be increased 
demand for food from the market as households deplete own produced stocks. 
 
The assessment showed that there was a reduction in production for most livestock types 
with  the  main  reason  for  a  reduction  being  disease  outbreaks  attributed  to  the  high 
temperatures that prevailed during the dry spells. This resulted in deaths of livestock. In 
term  of  fish,  the  survey  results  indicated  that  fish  catches  had  reduced  compared  to  the 
same time last year due to reduced water levels in the water bodies. 
 
Further,  the  assessment  results  have  shown  that  the  sale  of  agriculture  produce  mainly 
crops was the major income source for most households in the assessed districts. Further, 
the majority of the households spent most of their money on food items. About 61 percent 
of  households  from  the  assessed  districts  indicated  spending  49  percent  or  less  of  their 
household  income  on  food.  In  addition,  16  percent  of  households  indicated  spending 
between  50  and  64  percent  of  their  incomes  on  food.  This  trend  is  likely  to  change  in 
some districts whose production will not cover the desirable food requirement for the next 
eight (8) months especially their main income source (agriculture)  which was somewhat 
adversely affected by El Nino this year.  
 
The assessment indicated that most of the people in the assessed districts have acceptable 
food  consumption  scores  (41  percent)  followed  by  those  with  borderline  food 
consumption  scores  (33  percent).    The  assessment  results  showed  that  despite  most 
households having fairly good consumption scores, a challenge still exists in terms of the 

7 

 

number of times households from the assessed districts consumed food particularly those 
rich in nutrients that can be used to determine adequacy nutrients. 
 
The results have shown that the mean Reduced Coping Strategy Index (RCSI) increased 
in  most  assessed  districts  compared  to  last  year  and  this  was  mainly  attributed  to  the 
reduced access to seasonal foods owing to the late onset of rainfall which affected much 
of December, 2015 and part of January, 2016.  
 
In terms of health, Malaria and diarrhea diseases were the most prevalent similar to what 
came  out  of  the  previous  year.  There  is  need  to  strengthen  Malaria  Control  Programs 
especially in the districts that are currently showing an increase in malaria. There is need 
to strengthen water quality monitoring in all the districts to ensure safe water sources.  
 
The  findings  from  the  survey  showed  that  there  is  a  high  proportion  of  stunting  in 
children  under  five.  Equally  important  to  note  is  the  high  levels  of  wasting  (Weight  for 
Height). Nutrition results indicated that Stunting was 49.5 percent while underweight was 
14.7 percent. Both stunting and underweight were higher among boys than girls.  
 
For water, sanitation and hygiene, the assessment revealed that household access to total 
improved  water  supply  by  main  sources  was  at  55  percent  of  which  41  percent  was 
borehole,  8  percent  piped  water  and  6  percent  protected  well.  The  household  access  to 
total  unimproved  water  supply  was  at  45  percent  of  which  25  percent  was  unprotected 
well, 18 percent river or lake. Although the assessment also revealed that 51.7 percent of 
the  households  had  their  water  sources  affected  by  the  dry  spells,  no  household 
abandoned their primary water sources as their main water sources did not dry yet.  
 
The  results  have  also  shown  that  larger  proportion  of  households  had  no  sanitation 
facilities at all and opted to use open defecation. 
 
On Education, the numbers of children absent from school due to the effects of prolonged 
dry  spell  was  not  much.  However,  the  possibility  of  this  trend  increasing  is  there  if 
appropriate  interventions  are  not  put  in  place  to  reduce  the  withdrawal  of  children  to 
handle household chores which include looking for food during hunger peaks and caring 
for the sick at the expense of school.  
  

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

Early Warning 

Conclusions 

•  Despite  the  increase  in  the  number  communities  receiving  early  warning 
messages,  there  is  need  to  strengthen  the  nationally  managed  systems  and 
packaging to facilitate wider utilization by different community stakeholders. 

Recommendations 

•  ZMD  together  with  key  stakeholders  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture, 
Community  Development  and  Social  Welfare  and  DMMU  should  generate 

 

8 

information  packages  that  will  assist  the  public  stakeholder/communities  in 
accessing early warning messages on time. 

 

Agriculture and Food Security 

Conclusions 
 

•  Livelihood diversification has continued to be low for most households with crop 

production being the main livelihood and trading as the second most. 

•  Over dependency on crop farming especially maize is  risky considering the high 
sensitive  to  climate  changes  as  was  the  case  when  prolonged  dry  spells  affected 
the first part of 2015/16 rainfall season due to a strong El Nino. 
 

•  Households  did  not  utilize  all  the  available  land  for  cultivation  due  to  drought 

conditions and limited access to agricultural inputs. 

•  The promotion of maize production at the expense of other crops has made maize 
the  most  cultivated  crop  in  almost  all  these  areas.  However,  during  the  2015/16 
production  season  there  was  an  increase  in  production  of  sorghum,  rice,  millets 
and cassava. This  could  be partly attributed to the inclusion of rice and sorghum 
seed  in  the  Farmer  Input  Support  Programme  (FISP).  The  production  of  maize 
even in the marginal areas of south -western and extreme southern Zambia where 
conditions are not favourable for good growth exposes farmers to poor yields and 
consequently impact food security. 

•  Overall  maize  production  was  negatively  impacted  by  the  dry  spells  and 
production  reduced  in  comparison  to  previous  season.  Other  reasons  limiting 
production for the 2015/2016 season was lack of inputs; fertilizer, improved seed, 
inadequate  labour  and  lack  of  draught  power.  Southern  province  recorded  the 
highest  decline  in  production.  The  main  reason  for  not  acquiring  inputs  was  the 
high cost of fertilizers and seed in addition to not benefiting from the FISP. 

•  Out  of  a  total  maize  production,  407,049  MT  will  be  retained  by  households. 
Household  own  produced  stocks  for  93  percent  of  the  households  will  last  for  6 
months only compared to 23 percent in a good year and by November (start of the 
lean  period)  nearly  all  households  will  have  run  out  of  own  produced  stocks 
compared to 56 percent in a good year. 

•  Households  with  financial  capabilities  will  resort  to  markets  when  own  staple 
foods  run  out.  While  41  percent  of  the  communities  indicated  that  staple  food 
would  be  readily  available  at  local  markets  in  the  next  six  months,  the  rest  will 
have difficulties accessing staple food markets. The major limitation is distance to 
markets. 

•  While  markets  play  a  major  role  in  household  food  access,  the  above  five-year 
average maize and maize meal prices will limit market access for poor households 

9 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without sustainable incomes.  Households will have to resort to markets and other 
sources of food and/or coping strategies for the rest of the consumption season. 
 

•  Generally, all households in the assessed districts indicated having some form of 
storage  facilities  within  their  homesteads,  though  majority  are  not  that  climate 
sensitive to ensure their produce are safe guarded and/or last longer with minimal 
damage. 
 

•  The  most  common  foods  majority  of  the  households  preserved  for  future 

consumption included vegetables, cereals mainly maize and tubers. 

• 

Inadequate  pasture  and  water  availability  will  impact  negatively  on  livestock 
production  and  productivity.  As  a  result,  livestock  will  have  to  be  moved  or 
migrate long distances to access pasture and water mainly along major rivers and 
lakes.  The  large  flock  of  animals  in  these  areas  may  increase  the  probability  of 
livestock contracting diseases.  

•  Livestock  disease  incidences  continue  to  be  the  major  cause  of  livestock  deaths 
and  the  prolonged  dry  spells  experienced  in  the  previous  season  impacted 
negatively  on  pasture  and  water  availability  which  may  have  contributed  to 
disease outbreaks such as New castle for chicken.    

•  Fish catches have reduced, compared to the same time last year due to low water 
levels in water bodies (rivers, lakes, dams and ponds). Although the reduction in 
fish  catches  has  been  gradual  over  the  years  (due  to  bad  fishing  methods),  the 
negative effects of the poor rains for the past two seasons could have aggravated 
the  situation.  Affected  households  will  have  reduced  incomes  and  reduced  fish 
consumption.  

 

 

 

 
Recommendations 
 
Food requirements: 
 
Short Term 

•  A  total  of  975,738  People  (162,623  severely  and  moderately  affected  households)  from  the 
assessed  districts  will  require  support  for  the  period  of  eight  (8)  months  (August,  2016  – 
March, 2017) in thirty one (31) districts broken down as follows: 

o  For  the  period  August  to  December,  2016,  support  will  only  target  257,592  people 
(42,932 households) severely affected with food supplies constituting cereals (10,729 
MT),  pulses  (1,288  MT)  and  oil  (644  MT)  totaling  12,661  MT  in  twenty-six  (26) 
districts; 

o  From  January  to  March,  2017,  support  will  be  provided  through  the  Social  Cash 
Transfer (SCT) for the ZVAC caseload of 975,738 People (162,623 households for a 
period of three (3) months in thirty-one (31) districts. 

o  As this is the first time support is being provided through the current SCT, not all the 
affected  households  may  be  absorbed.  The  ZVAC  caseload  of  975,738  People 
(162,623 households) that may not be absorbed will be assisted for a period three (3) 
months starting January to March 2017, with relief food support constituting cereals 

10 

 

(24,384  MT),  pulses  (2,927  MT)  and  oil  (1,464  MT)  totaling  28,775  MT  will  be 
provided. 

•  Provision  of  emergency  input  support  to  households  (13,699)  whose  incomes 
from agriculture livelihoods were adversely affected by dry spells and will not be 
able  to  procure  through  markets  and/or  benefit  from  existing  input  support 
programmes.  

Medium Term 

•  Support for increased food crop productivity at household level so as to enable them 

to have adequate own produced food and cash crops through: 

o  Mechanization  for  farmers  to  put  more  land  under  cultivation.  This  can  be 
done  through  provision  of  loans  for  farm  implements  such  as  the  ZNFU 
mechanization programme.   

o  Increased  access  to  fertilizers  and  improved  seeds  through  diversified  input 
packs  such  as  E-voucher  that  provides  for  farmers  to  access  inputs  of  their 
choice. 

o  Provision of emergency inputs to households whose incomes from agriculture 
livelihoods  were  adversely  affected  by  dry  spells  and  will  not  be  able  to 
procure 
input  support 
programmes 

through  markets  and/or  benefit  from  existing 

o  Increased 

in  small  scale 
technologies for off-season production.   

investment 

irrigation  and  water  harvesting 

o  Scaling up of conservation agriculture practices among small scale farmers in 

drought prone areas. 
 
Long Term 
• 

Improving access to markets by: 

o  Investing in improvement of road infrastructure specifically feeder roads.  
o  Open up rural areas through improved services for ease of doing business and 

thus increase establishment of small businesses in outlying areas. 
 

• 

Improving  storage  facilities  at  homestead  level  to  ensure  food  materials  last  longer, 
help  optimize  farmer’s  gains  and  help  in  preserving  the  nutrition  quality  of  foods. 
This  can  ride  on  existing  Post  Harvest  Loss  initiatives  and./or  projects  that  are 
promoting  the  construction  of  durable  concrete  and  covered  cribs,  use  of  Pandew 
Improved Crop Storage bags, concrete and metal silos.  

•  Livestock productivity improvement 

o  Improve  water  supply  for  livestock  through  construction  of  dams,  weirs,  and 

water harvesting and deepening of natural ponds.  

o  Dissemination  of  technologies  on 

improved  pasture  management  and 

preservation of crop residues for stock feed. 

o  Enhanced  immunization  programmes  and  intensified  extension  services  for 

livestock disease control and management. 

•  Fisheries development 

o  Fish  restocking  in  major  fisheries  and  intensified  education  on  sustainable 

fishing methods. 

o  Expansion  of  aqua  culture  support  programmes  to  increase  number  of 

households with ponds, and providing services for supply of fingerings

Health 

Conclusion 

•  There  is  generally  an  increase  in  the  number  of  households  reporting  having  a 
member or more that suffered from  malaria and  diarrhea in  the first  quarter of 2016 
compared to the same period in 2015. 

o 

 Malaria was highest in Luano and Chirundu (Valley districts) districts while 
diarrhea disease was high in every district 

• 

 There was an improvement in health seeking behavior with majority going to formal 
health  facilities  though  a  small  proportion  opted  not  to  seek  for  formal  care  due  to 
lack of money. 

•  The assessment has shown that despite the disease patterns not changing significantly 
between  2015  and  2016,  Malaria,  Diarrhoea  and  respiratory  tract  infections  are  still 
the leading causes of illness in the assessed communities. Changes in weather patterns 
have  potential  to  increase  risks  associated  with  these  conditions.  Particularly  low 
water levels  that is  associated with  the El Nino phenomena has potential to  increase 
the  incidence  of  diarrhoea  diseases.  There  is  need  to  enhance  WASHE  programs  in 
affected communities.  

•  Heat  stress  has  also  been  associated  with  increased  incidences  of  respiratory  tract 
infections hence the need for increased surveillance in the affected communities. The 
country has observed reduced malaria incidences in the past few years though malaria 
still remains among the top 10 causes of ill health.  

•  The addition of reproductive health aspects in this assessment opens another window 
of opportunity to assess the impact of adverse weather patterns on reproductive health 
services.  In  the  Zambian  setting,  women  play  a  key  role  in  the  wellbeing  of  their 
families  and  changes  in  social  economic  situation  and  weather  patterns  such  as  that 
brought about by the El Nino phenomenon could lead to women failing to attend their 
routine  health  care  services  such  as  scheduled  antenatal  care,  post-natal  care,  and 
family planning services. 

 
•  The reduced number of women visiting health facilities for family planning, antenatal, 
postnatal, and delivery services in  the first  quarter 2016 needs further  attention with 
increased awareness raising through community agents and other means. Since there 
are no fees for primary health care services including reproductive health services in 
the  public  health  sector,  the  reduced  numbers  of  women  accessing  these  services  in 
2016  compared  to  2015  cannot  be  attributed  to  lack  of  money  but  to  other  factors. 
Further  assessments  need  to  be  done  on  this  aspect  to  come  up  with  targeted 
interventions. What is of particular note is the significant reduction in cases of sexual 
violence reported in 2016 compared to 2015. Further, investigations need to be done 
to establish the real reason for the reduced numbers of sexual violence cases.  

 
• 

 

 

It is encouraging to note that majority of households are seeking health care from the 
formal health systems. This is an opportunity to ensure information sharing regarding 
behavioural  change  for  aspects  such  as  malaria  prevention,  prevention  of  diarrhoea, 
antenatal  and  postnatal  clinic  attendance,  and  the  importance  of  delivering  at  health 
facilities by skilled attendants regardless of the social economic situation.  

12 

•  These interventions include use of community agents such as safe motherhood action 
groups,  use  of  maternity  waiting  homes  for  women  who  come  from  long  distances. 
This  also  applies  to  women  who  have  identified  risks  and  require  to  deliver  in 
facilities with highly skilled staff and specialised equipment. Delivery of reproductive 
health  services  through  outreach  to  communities  is  critical  in  such  communities 
especially that the main reasons given for not going to seek care from health facilities 
was lack of transport or lack of transport money. 
 

Recommendations 

Short term 

•  Enhanced programs to address malaria to include social and environmental 

determinants to ensure targeted interventions. This will include the following: 

o  Community sensitizations on preventions of Malaria.  
o  Increase the coverage of indoor-residual spraying districts. 
o  Supporting communities to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds. 
o  Increased  distribution  of  insecticide  treated  mosquito  nets  in  the  affected 

areas. 

•  There  is  need  for  enhanced  campaigns  to  encourage  women’s  utilisation  of 
maternal  and  reproductive  health  services  from  health  facilities.  This  could  also 
include  increased  coverage  with  integrated  outreach  services  for  maternal  and 
other reproductive health services such as family planning.   

•  One cost effective and efficient way to address reduced utilisation of reproductive 
health services would be to take the integrated approach. This includes integrating 
reproductive health services with other primary health care services such as HIV, 
Malaria preventions, etc. This can be done both through static or integrated mobile 
outreach  service  delivery  and 
through  other  communication  engagement 
approaches.  

•  Since  only  selected  diseases  were  assessed,  there  is  need  to  have  further 
assessments of a broader spectrum of health services across the affected areas to 
understand the impact of prolonged dry spell on overall health care delivery. This 
could  involve  surveys  or  desk  review  of  the  health  management  information 
systems data.  

Medium to Long term  

•  Enhance malaria and diarrhoea surveillance at community level. 
• 

 Need  for  sustained  commodity  supply  for  treatment  of  all  infections  especially 
Malaria, diarrhea diseases, and reproductive health services. 

•  There  need  for  a  multi-sectoral  and  multi-disciplinary  approach  to  enhance  the 
health  response.  This  includes  incorporating  messages  on  better  health  seeking 
behaviours  into  other  interventions  such  as  nutrition,  agriculture  input  support, 
etc. 

 

13 

•  Need to carry out a detailed financial and programmatic gap analysis of the health 
care delivery system in the affected areas to help in designing of medium and long 
term interventions to mitigate the impact of prolonged dry spells on health.   

•  There is need for creation or enhancement of a multidisciplinary response team to 
design  a  health  surveillance  and  response  plan  for  current  and  future  adverse 
weather and other related events.  

Nutrition 
 
Conclusion 
 
•  The  findings  from  the  survey  showed  that  there  is  a  high  proportion  of  stunting  in 
children  under  five.  Equally  important  to  note  is  the  high  levels  of  wasting  (Weight 
for  Height).  Using  MUAC  measurements,  it  showed  that  there  was  an  increase  in 
wasting  over  a  period  of  2  years  (2015  and  2016  VAC  results).  Evidence  show  that 
high  and  increasing  undernutrition  levels  as  the  case  was  for  this  survey,  poses  a 
serious impact on morbidity and mortality on children under five. 

 
•  All  the  factors  that  have  been  discussed  as  risk  factors  to  nutrition  are  further 
illustrated  in  the  UNICEF  causality  conceptual  framework  as  either  immediate  or 
underlying causes of undernutrition.  

 
Recommendations 
 
Short term measures 

• 

Integration of nutrition in health-promotion strategies especially those addressing 
maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy and lactation, these should include 
interventions that address adolescent nutrition. 

•  Scaling  up  coverage  and  rolling  out  of  stunting-prevention  interventions  in 

emergency areas. These may include: 

o  Infant and young child interventions. 
o  Increased  micronutrient  intakes  especially  during  the  1,000  most  critical 

days.  

o  Interventions for addressing severe acute malnutrition.  
The  above  may  include  promotion  of  consumption  of  healthy,  diversified 
diets, including high quality nutrient rich foods for both men and women. 
 

Long term measures 

•  Promotion  of  livelihood  diversification  to  include  crops  beyond  maize,  fisheries 

and animal products for vulnerable but viable households to address poverty. 
 

Water, Sanitation and Hygiene 

Conclusions for WASH 

•  Generally,  households  reported  that  their  main  water  sources  got  affected  by 

prolonged dry spell. 

•  Some  water  sources  were  perceived  to  be  contaminated  but  majority  of 

households in the surveyed districts did not treat their drinking water. 

Recommendations for WASH 

 

14 

Short – term (Water) 

•  Continue to drill boreholes in areas where water sources are unimproved, where 
the water levels reduced and where the distance from household to water point is 
more than 500m.  

•  Continuous monitoring of the situation in the affected districts in case of water 

points drying out and determining alternative water sources.   

•  Rehabilitations, improvements and maintenance of existing water infrastructure 

that are affected by dry spells. 

Short – term (Sanitation) 

•  Promote community wide sanitation improvement using CLTS as part of the ODF 

Zambia 2020.  

•  Promote a community wide handwashing campaign as part of the implementation 
of the ODF Zambia 2020 program to increase the practice of proper handwashing. 
•  Promoting CLTS monitoring and maintaining ODF status, clean environment, and 

partnering with traditional leaders, local religious leaders and the influence and 
opportunities they have in bringing messages of personal cleanliness and well-
being to their community.  

•  Promote private sector involvement in sanitation marketing to support 

communities and households to build robust and appropriate latrines versions 
from the start (taking the transformation agenda, Vision 2030 for Zambia and the 
ODF Zambia 2020). 

•  Promote and construct demonstration latrines at the schools, health centres, rural 

community centres (markets, faith centers, and traditional chiefs’ palaces). 

 

Medium and long term (Water) 

•  Promote and ensure community involvement in planning, designing and 

construction of multi-purpose water infrastructure (e.g., small dams and ancillary 
works) and in watershed management. 

•  Rehabilitation, improvements and maintenance of existing water supply 

infrastructure. 

•  Plan for and implement with support of NGOs the water harvesting program at 

community and household levels for climate change adaptation. 

•  Promote community level modern energy adoption, water supply and sanitation 

technology options, disaster risk reduction and resilience building including 
climate change adaptation activities, to ensure preparedness, resilience and 
mitigation of disasters. 

Medium and long term (Sanitation) 

•  Provide external technical advice in challenging geographical environments while 

ensuring full consultation with beneficiaries regarding technical challenges and 
solutions.  

•  Promote “Smart” subsidies targeted to particularly vulnerable groups (including 

cash for the ODF Zambia 2020 transfers) or to households facing significant 

15 

 

technical and physical challenges to latrine building (including mason/ artisan 
technical support).  

•  Promote public-private partnerships or private involvement to build sanitation 
shops at District/Chiefdom level to sell sanitation facilities and give advice on 
improved sanitation facility construction, and latrine operation and maintenance.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION 

1.1.  Background 
 
According  to  the  seasonal  forecast  issued  by  the  Zambia  Meteorological  Department 
(ZMD)  in  September  2015,  the  country  had  a  higher  likelihood  of  receiving  normal  to 
below  normal  rainfall  for  most  parts  of  the  season  from  October,  2015  to  March,  2016. 
The end of season analysis showed that for the start of season anomaly (compared to  5-
year average), some parts of Luapula and Muchinga Provinces had an early start of about 
three  dekads  (31st  December  2015).  However,  some  parts  of  Southern  and  Lusaka 
Provinces  including  some  eastern  parts  of  the  country  experienced  a  late  start  by  three 
dekads (refer to annex 1).  
 
As  at  31st  March,  2016,  the  Water  Requirement  Satisfaction  Index  (WRSI)  for  maize 
showed  that  maize  generally  performed  well  overall  as  the  conditions  were  satisfied 
especially in the northern half of the country (category good to very good). However, the 
picture  was  somewhat  different  over  the  southern  half  of  the  country  with  small  areas 
over Luangwa and Gwembe districts being poor with the rest of the country having WSRI 
being average to mediocre (Refer to Annex 1).  
 
In general, this mediocre start of the season coupled with prolonged dry spells resulted in 
depletion  of  water  availability  for  livestock  and  domestic  use,  loss  of  soil  moisture  that 
led  to  severe  wilting  of  early  planted  crops  as  well  as  increased  scarcity  of  pasture.  In 
view  of  this,  the  2016  In-depth  and  Needs  Assessment  was  designed  with  the  sole 
purpose of understanding the impact the delayed onset of rains and prolonged dry spells 
had on selected sectors of the economy. This needs and impact assessment covered forty-
two (42) districts of Central (Chibombo, Chisamba, Luano), Eastern(Chadiza, Mambwe, 
Nyimba,  Petauke,  Vubwi),  Lusaka(Chongwe,  Chirundu,  Kafue,  Luangwa,  Rufunsa, 
Shibuyunji),  Southern(Choma,  Chikankata,  Gwembe,  Kalomo,  Kazungula,  Mazabuka, 
Monze,  Namwala,  Sinazongwe,  Pemba,  Siavonga,  Zimba)  and  Western(Kalabo, 
Mwandi, Senanga, Sesheke, Shangombo, Nalolo, Sikongo, Sioma, Mulobezi, Limulunga, 
Kaoma, Nkeyema, Luampa, Mitete, Lukulu. Mongu) Provinces. (Refer to Annex 2).

1.2. Objectives 

1.2.1 OVERALL OBJECTIVE 
To  assess  the  impact  of  prolonged  dry  spells  experienced  during  the  2015-2016  rainfall 
season on food security (Agriculture, WATSAN, Health and Nutrition) in order to inform 
appropriate interventions.  
 
1.2.2 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES 
The following were the specific objectives: 

i.  Determine the severity of the prolonged dry spells on livelihoods; 
ii.  Determine the number of affected people and areas; 
iii.  Determine food and non – food needs, if any; and 
iv.  Recommend some appropriate interventions to address the problem. 

1.3 Scope of the In-Depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment 
The broader themes covered in the assessment included the following:  

Household Questionnaire themes covered were as follows: 

•  Household Demographics  
•  Productive Asset Ownership 
•  Agriculture Production (Crop and Livestock Production) 
•  Livelihoods and Expenditure Patterns 
•  Household Coping Strategies 
•  Food Sources and Consumption 
•  Water, Sanitation and Hygiene 
•  Health  
•  Nutrition 

Community and District Questionnaires themes covered were as follows: 

•  Description on the rainfall performance 
•  Review the impact of rainfall (2015/16 rainfall season) 
•  Community Income Sources (Livelihoods) 
•  Agriculture Production (Crops and Livestock) 
•  Prices for staple foods 
•  Access and Livelihoods 
•  Health and Nutrition 
•  Water, Sanitation and Hygiene 
•  Safety Nets programmes 
•  Development Projects 

 

1.4. Limitations of the Survey 
The following were the limitations of the survey: 

•  Most of the maps were not well detailed as they missed land mark features for 

identifying enumeration areas; 
Inaccessibility of some areas; and  

• 
•  Challenges  in determining population and boundaries for the newly created 

districts leading to either over or underestimations of the district estimates. 

 

18 

CHAPTER TWO: METHODOLOGY 

 

2.1. Identifying Areas to be assessed 
 

In identifying the areas to be assessed, all the districts of the country were first analysed 

based on a set criteria of indicators and thresholds. The following key indicators were 

used in determining the list of hotspot districts covered in the 2016 In-Depth 

Vulnerability and Needs Assessment: 

 

Table 1: Integrated Context Analysis 

INDICATOR 

CRITERIA 

WATER 
REQUIREMENT 
SATISFACTION INDEX (WRSI) 

WRSI was less than 50% (failure) and/or between 50-60 

(poor) for dekads in November, 2015 through to February 

2016 and mediocre. The cut – off for selection was three 

dekad or more of WRSI from November dekad 1 through to 

February Dekad 3 of anything below mediocre. 

ANTICIPATED CROP LOSS 

All districts with expected crop loss of 40% or more. 

PRICE CHANGE 

This was done by comparing the district January, 2016 price 
with the five (5) year average with the selection picking all 
prices with 50 percent or more.

2.3. Target Population  
 
2.3.1. Target Population  
 
The  target  population  is  the  number  of  people  living  in  the  districts  identified  to  have 
been affected by prolonged dry spells that occurred during the 2015/2016 rainfall season. 
A total of forty-two (42) districts were targeted.  
 
2.3.2. Sampling Frame  
 
Sampling  frames  are  lists  or  enumeration  procedures  that  allow  identifying  every 
individual  of  the  target  population  (Kish,  1965;  Kalton,  1983).  The  simplest  form  of  a 

20 

 

sample frame is a target population list or database in which each individual of the target 
population is uniquely identified.  
 
Zambia is administratively divided into ten (10) provinces. Each province is in turn sub-
divided  into  districts.  Each  district  is  further  sub-divided  into  constituencies  and  wards. 
For statistical purposes, each ward is subdivided into Census Supervisory Areas (CSAs) 
which, in turn, are sub-divided into Standard Enumeration Areas (SEAs). The SEAs are 
geographical  areas,  classified  as  either  rural  or  urban,  have  information  on  number  of 
households  and  the  population  size.  This  demarcation  is  done  through  a  mapping 
exercise.  
 
Prior to the 2010 Census of Population and Housing, the Central Statistical Office (CSO)-
Zambia conducted a mapping exercise. Based on the Census results, data collected during 
the  mapping  exercise  was  updated.  The  national  frame  has  an  updated  list  of  Standard 
Enumeration  Areas  (SEAs).  The  frame  has  25,631  SEAs  and  2,815,  897  households.  A 
listing  of  SEAs  in  all  the  forty-one  (42)  districts  was  the  sampling  main  frame  for  the 
2016  In-Depth  Vulnerability  and  Assessment  Survey.  The  SEAs  were  the  primary 
sampling units for the survey.  
 

2.3.3. Sample allocation  

The  survey  targeted  forty-two  (42)  districts  in  five  (5)  provinces.  Provision  of  precise 
survey estimates for each district required that samples of adequate sizes be allocated to 
each district. Since it was desired that estimates from each district have the same level of 
precision, an equal allocation was the most efficient strategy. Therefore, an equal sample 
of  15  clusters  or  150  households  was  allocated  to  each  of  the  forty-two  (42)  districts. 
However,  for  Monze  District  in  Southern  Province,  only  the  District  Questionnaire  was 
administered due to an outbreak of Cholera there. 
 
 

2.3.4. Sampling Method  

The 2016 In-Depth Vulnerability and Assessment Survey employed probability sampling 
procedures.  A  two-stage  stratified  cluster  sample  design  was  used.  In  the  first  stage,  15 
SEAs  were  selected  using  the  Probability  Proportional  to  Estimated  Size  (PPES) 
procedure.  During  the  second  stage,  10  households  were  randomly  selected  from  each 
enumeration  area.  Random  does  not  in  any  way  imply  haphazard;  rather  it  means  that 
each possible household had an equal chance of being selected. 
 

2.3.5 Sample Size 
A  total  of  6,150  households  in  605  SEAs  were  covered  in  the  41  districts  with  an 
estimated population of 3,874,878 people.  
 

2.3.6. Weighting Procedure  
 
Sampling  weights  are  needed  to  compensate  for  unequal  selection  probabilities,  non-
coverage, non-response, and for known differences between the sample and the reference 
population. Thus sample weights act as boosting factors to represent the number of units 
in the survey population that are accounted for by the sample unit to which the weight is 
assigned.  

21 

 

2.3.7. Base Weights  

The first type of weight that is normally calculated is the design weight, also known as base 
weight.  Construction  of  the  base  weights  for  the  sampled  units  corrects  for  their  unequal 
probabilities  of  selection.  The  base  weight  of  a  sampled  unit  is  the  number  of  units  in  the 
population  that  are  represented  by  the  sampled  unit  for  purposes  of  estimation  (UNSTATS, 
2005). It is derived as a reciprocal of the probability of selection for inclusion in the sample.  
Since  a  two-stage  sample  design  was  used  for  the  2016  In-Depth  Vulnerability  and  Needs 
Assessment Survey, the base weights were constructed to reflect the probabilities of selection 
at each stage.  
 
a) Probability of selecting a primary sampling unit (1st Stage).  
The primary sampling unit for the survey was a SEA. Its probability of selection is given by; 
 

 

Where: 

 

 

 

 

b) Probability of selecting a household (2nd Stage)  

The probability of selecting a household was given by; 

 

Where: 

 

 

 

c) Overall probability of selecting a household  

The overall probability of selecting a household is given as the product of the 
probabilities 

Therefore, the base weight was calculated as below; 

 

 

2.3.8 Post Stratification Adjustment 
The survey collected data on all usual household members. The weighted sum of the total 

number  of  household  members  (household  size)  is  supposed  to  give  a  good  estimate  of 

the current population in a particular district. 

 

22 

The weighted results generated underestimated and in some cases overestimated the total 

population when compared to the CSO projected population. This was mainly due to lack 

of updating of the cartographic frame to reflect population growth over time. The frame 

was  based  on  2010  population.  This  necessitated  the  adjustment  of  the  base-weights  to 

reflect  the  2016  population  projections  for  the  districts.  The  procedure  for  adjusting  the 

weights based on population projections is given below: 

 

Where r = adjustment factor 

Yproj= the projected population  

Yest= the estimated population from the survey  

 

The final weight is given by: 
 
Wadj= Wh*r 
 
Where Wadj= the adjusted final household weight. 

2.3.9. Reliability of Estimates  
 
Reliability of estimates in the 2016 In-Depth Vulnerability and Assessment Survey was 

affected by both sampling and non-sampling errors. 

Sampling  error  is  the  part  of  the  difference  between  a  population  value  and  an  estimate  thereof,  derived 

from a random sample, which is due to the fact that only a sample of values is observed. Sampling errors 

arise from the fact that not all units of the targeted population are enumerated, but only a  sample of them. 

Therefore,  the  information  collected  on  the  units  in  the  sample  may  not  perfectly  reflect  the  information 

which could have been collected on the whole population. The difference is the sampling error. EUROSTAT 

To  reduce  sampling  errors,  a  sufficient  sample  size  was  determined  for  this  survey. 
Sampling errors were further minimized by using a stratified sample design. The sample 
was explicitly stratified into 48 strata and implicit stratification was provided ordering or 
sorting the list of SEAs for each strata. 
 
Non-Sampling  error  is  an  error  in  sample  estimates  which  cannot  be  attributed  to  sampling  fluctuations. 

Non-sampling  errors  may  arise  from  many  different  sources  such  as  defects  in  the  frame,  faulty 

demarcation of sample units, defects in the selection of sample units, mistakes in the collection of data due 

to  personal  variations  or  misunderstanding  or  bias  or  negligence  or  dishonesty  on  the  part  of  the 

investigator or of the interviewer, mistakes at the stage of the processing of the data, etc. OECD 

Non-sampling errors may have arisen from many factors at all stages of data collection 
and processing. These include errors resulting from: 

✓  Respondents misunderstanding the questions;  

23 

 

✓  Incorrect presentation of the questions;  

✓  Question specific non-response;  

✓  Errors in data entry; and  

✓  Errors during coding.  
 

The report therefore contains no quantitative assessments of these errors. Although it was 
not possible to eliminate all sources of error, a high level of control on all known sources 
of  error  was  done  efficiently  and  effectively  in  planning  and  conducting  the  survey. 
Below  are  the  key  steps  that  were  taken  to  minimize  or  control  non-sampling  errors 
during the survey:  

✓  The  most  recent  sampling  frame,  based  on  the  2010  Census  of  Population  and 

Housing was used;  

✓  Thoroughly testing questionnaires before being used in the field;  
✓  Non-responding households were followed up to achieve high response rates;  
✓  High  quality  editing  and  cleaning  procedures  were  employed  in  processing  the 

data; and  

✓  International standard procedures and processes were employed at all stages of the 

survey process.  

 

2.4. Food Needs Computation 
2.4.1. Determining the Food Insecure Districts and Number of persons in Need 
 

To  determine  food  insecure  districts  and  number  of  people  requiring  food  assistance, 
Consolidated  Approach  for  Reporting  Indicators  (CARI)  of  Food  Security  approach  to 
combine  food  security  indicators  that  included  Food  Consumption  Score  (FCS),  Food 
Expenditure  share  and  Livelihood  Coping  Strategy  Categories  (LCS)  were  used.  The 
table below describes further the indicators used:

CHAPTER THREE: CONTEXT 

3.1. The Economy 

Zambia’s economy grew at an average annual rate of 7 percent between 2010 and 2014. 
However, global headwinds and domestic pressures have strained the Zambian economy. 
Consequently, growth in 2015 fell to an estimated 3 percent (compared to 4.9 percent in 
2014)  following  a  six-year  low  in  copper  prices  and  increasing  power  outages.  The 
benefits  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  have  accrued  mainly  to  the  richer 
segments of the population in urban areas.  

During the period 2015 to 2016, Zambia’s economy performed relatively well within the 
region despite the decline in the growth rate from a five-year average of 6 to 4.8 percent. 
The falling copper prices, exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) have weakened the 
economy.  According  to  the  London  Metal  Exchange  (LME),  Copper  prices  declined  by 
almost a third from their peak in February, 2011 to $4,595/ton in February, 2016 and are 
forecast to remain soft until 2018 as global supply currently exceeds demand.  

Agriculture, on the other hand, put in a strong performance growing at over 6 percent as a 
result  of  a  sustained  good  maize  harvest.  Economic  performance  is  expected  to  remain 
strong  in  the  medium  term  driven  by  large  investments  in  infrastructure  and  increased 
domestic and  foreign investments.  Diversifying  the economy  away  from dependence on 
copper  and  the  creation  of  decent  jobs  remain  the  overarching  policy  goals  of  the 
government. Improving accountability and strengthening the fight against corruption also 
remain  firmly  on  the  government’s  agenda.  The  government  is  committed  to  expand 
skills  and education while also  accelerating  interventions in  health, water and sanitation 
in the medium to long term.  
 
Economic  development  will  be  accelerated  by  the  completion  of  roads  infrastructure 
projects  and  thus  provide  an  impetus  for  growth  in  the  country.  These  infrastructure 
works  on  roads,  bridges  and  railways  will  lead  to  an  influx  of  investments,  creating  a 
basis  for  further  development.  Spatial  inclusion  as  addressed  through  the  Revised  Sixth 
National  Development  Plan  with  an  added  benefit  of  industrial  policy  has  seen  the 
creation  of  multi-facility  economic  zones  aimed  at  creating  opportunities  in  the  main 
urban agglomerations and attracting foreign investments. 
 
 
Macroeconomic policy 
 
Fiscal  policy  
Although the fiscal deficit continued to widen in 2015, Government is committed to fiscal 
stabilization underpinned by tighter controls and monitoring. The fiscal outturn has been 
achieved through lower than expected capital  expenditure in  the order of 13 percent  but 
largely  counteracted  by  relatively  higher  than  programmed  expenditures  for  strategic 
maize  purchases  and  farmer  input  subsidies.  The  most  important  capital  expenditure 
projects  continue  to  be  in  roads  and  energy.  In  the  medium  term,  the  Government  is 
targeting a fiscal deficit of 3.2 percent of GDP by 2017 although this may prove difficult 
to achieve.  

 

 

 

26 

 
Monetary policy  
The Central Bank continued to pursue tight monetary policy during the first half of 2016. 
This was necessitated by the rising inflationary pressures brought about by expansionary 
fiscal  policy,  substantial  increases  in  public  wages  and  pass-through  effects  from  the 
depreciating Kwacha. 

 

transport  and 

Recent Developments and Prospects  
 
Economic  turmoil  in  the  global  economy  has  had  far  reaching  effects  on  the  Zambian 
economy.  Copper  production  decreased  by  20  percent  in  2016  to  about  800  000  metric 
tonnes. In January, 2015 Government increased royalty rates to 20 percent and 8 percent 
for  open  cast  mining  and  underground  mining,  respectively,  while  abolishing  corporate 
taxes.  Prior  to  the  change,  a  uniform  rate  of  6  percent  was  applied  across  the  industry. 
Under  the  new  regime,  with  the  high  cost  of  mining  in  Zambia  relative  to  producers  in 
coastal  countries,  mine  profitability  has  been  lower,  reducing  investments  and  future 
growth. However, the policy change culminated in care and maintenance for some mining 
companies exacerbated by the fall in copper prices.  
 
Agriculture,  construction, 
financial  services  demonstrated  good 
performance, though not enough to increase overall growth to former levels. Despite poor 
rainfall  performance  fashioned  by  El  Nino  climatic  conditions,  the  agriculture  sector 
experienced  a  bullish  maize  harvest  in  2016  despite  a  slow  start  with  the  rains  at  the 
beginning of the planting season, which improved in the latter half of the season. Maize 
production  remained  at  the  same  level  compared  to  the  five-year  average.  This  was 
attributed  to  the  expansion  in  coverage  of  conservation  farming  and  an  increase  in 
productivity by more than 20 percent.  
 
High inflation has been contained and is now stable. However, it was estimated to fall to 
8 percent from 21.3 percent in May, 2016 due to effective tightening of monetary policy 
by the Central Bank. The pressure on inflation came through rising food prices during the 
beginning  of  the  year.  Prices  were  also  driven  by  the  rapid  depreciation  of  the  Kwacha 
(ZMW) since 2014, pushing the exchange rate above ZMW 10 per USD. The exchange 
rate averaged ZMW 11 per USD in the first quarter of 2016 compared to average ZMW 
5.54 in December, 2013.  
 

Poverty 

According  to  the  2015  Living  Conditions  Monitoring  Survey,  poverty  remains 
predominantly a rural phenomenon with poverty levels at 76.6 percent compared to 23. 4 
percent  in  urban  areas.  Accelerating  poverty  reduction  will  require  large-scale  and 
continuous  investments  to  improve  agricultural  productivity,  the  backbone  of  the  rural 
economy.  Sustained  allocations  and  investments  in  infrastructure  such  as  roads  will 
provide connectivity from rural-producing areas to the urban consuming markets, thereby 
improving economic integration between the two regions.  
 
Government in 2014 crafted the Social Protection Policy to better provide and coordinate 
contributory  and  non-contributory  social  protection  programmes  in  the  country.  The 
National  Pensions  Scheme  Authority  has  been  the  main  governing  body  for  Zambia’s 
employment  insurance  scheme  while  several  pilot  non-contributory  cash  transfer 
programmes for poor and vulnerable groups is being implemented by Government and its 
stakeholders. However, there is no pension scheme to serve the large majority of informal 
workers. 

27 

 

The  Zambian  government  is  in  the  process  of  developing  the  Seventh  National 
Development  Plan  -  2017-2021.  This  provides  an  opportunity  to  prioritize  government 
objectives  towards  poverty  reduction  and  strengthening  the  linkages  between  budgeting 
and  planning.  It  is  part  of  the  cascading  system  of  planning  that  commenced  with  the 
National Vision 2030 prepared in 2005 and breaks down to rolling annual plans.   

 

3.2. Agriculture and Food Security 

 

3.2.1. Crop Production, Food Availability and Access 
 

Despite  the  late  start  of  the  2015/16  season,  erratic  rainfall  and  prolonged  dry  spells 
experienced during the first half, the country generally received favourable rainfall from 
mid-January  to  early  April,  2016.  This  resulted  in  better  than  expected  yields  for  most 
crops.  Overall  crop  production  varied  with  some  crops  achieving  increased  production 
while others production declined in comparison to the previous season. The southern half 
of the country was impacted more by the prolonged dry spells and therefore had relatively 
reduced production compared to previous season and the five-year average.  
 
Production  increases  were  recorded  for  maize,  soya  beans,  rice,  groundnuts,  sorghum, 
sweet potatoes and seed cotton while millet, mixed beans and tobacco production was less 
compared to previous season. Maize continues to be the main staple food for Zambia with 
the  2015/16  production  at  2,873,052  MT  which  is  10  percent  higher  than  the  2014/15 
production level and also the five-year average. Out of this 1,382,871 MT is expected to 
be  sold  and  1,490,181MT  (51  percent)  will  be  retained  at  household  level.  Most  of  the 
maize  production  is  from  small  and  medium  scale  farmers  while  commercial  farmer’s 
contribution was at six percent.  
 
The  Government  has  put  in  place  a  number  of  initiatives  to  build  resilience  at  the 
household level. The Government piloted the Electronic Voucher (E-voucher) in thirteen 
districts  in  the  2015/2016  season.  A  total  of  1,000,000  beneficiaries  were  targeted  for 
both E-Voucher and the conventional Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP). In the E-
voucher, 241,000 beneficiaries were targeted with each beneficiary getting two thousand 
one hundred Kwacha (2,100) for purchasing of agriculture inputs. In the traditional FSIP 
in  the 2014/2015  farming season, a total  number of 759,000 farmers were targeted with 
each beneficiary getting four (4) bags of fertilizer and 10kg of maize seed.  

 

3.2.2. National Food Supply for the 2014/2015 Season 

The 2016/17 marketing season National Food Balance sheet produced by the Ministry of 
Agriculture indicates that the country produced adequate maize to meet the total national 
requirement. Estimated maize harvest was 2.873, 052MT. Carryover stock were 667, 524 
MT giving total availability of 3,540,577 MT. Total requirements for the country stands 
at  2,905,896 MT leaving an exportable surplus of 634,681 MT.  In addition, the country 
has adequate supplies of wheat, cassava flour, sweet potatoes sorghum and millets while 
an estimated 40,000 MT of rice will have to be imported to meet national requirements.

3.2.3. Food Access 

At  national  level,  there  is  expected  to  be  adequate  supplies  of  maize  and  other  staple 
foods  but  at  local  level  access  will  depend  on  availability  of  own  produced  stocks  and 
household  purchasing  power.  Most  farming  households  in  northern  Zambia  will  have 
adequate  own  produced  stocks  while  in  southern  Zambia,  a  number  of  households  are 
likely to run out of own produced stocks earlier than normal due to reduced harvests as a 
result  of  prolonged  dry  spells  experienced  in  the  earlier  part  of  the  growing  season 
(November to mid-January). Overall household food access will depend on market access 
as supplies are likely to be adequate.  Traders will have to play a larger role of supplying 
deficit  areas  while  the  Food  Reserve  Agency  who  are  expected  to  purchase  a  total  of 
1,000,000 MT of maize, 500,000 MT for the strategic reserve and 500,000 MT for price 
stabilization  is  expected  to  supply  the  market  from  November,  2016  to  April,  2017  to 
millers as well as community sales on demand.  
 
Maize prices in the 2015/16 marketing season were well above both the previous season 
and  the  five-year  average.  Lusaka  Maize  grain  prices  are  indicative  of  national  price 
trends  (Figure  1).  The  high  prices  were  mainly  due  to  pressure  exerted  by  increased 
regional demand for Zambian maize due to large staple food deficits in the neighbouring 
countries.  Zambia by March, 2016 had exported 796 MT of maize to the region. About 
80  percent  of  formal  maize  exports  from  Zambia  were  destined  for  Zimbabwe  while 
about 15percent was for the Malawian market.

During March and April, 2016, there was supply constraint resulting in sporadic shortages 
and  sharp  increases  in  maize  prices  at  a  number  of  markets.  As  a  result,  government 
imposed  restrictions  on  maize  exports  for  a  week  in  order  to  increase  supply  to  local 
markets  and  stabilize  prices.  For  the  2016/17  marketing  season,  government  has  stated 
that  there  will  be  no  maize  exports  from  the  current  harvest  up  to  September,  2016  to 
allow  purchases  for  local  needs  but  export  by  traders  of  the  167,000MT  already 
contracted will be allowed. Due to the continued large deficit in the region, it is expected 
that 2016/17 maize prices will continue to be above  five-year average which is likely to 
restrict  access  for  both  urban  and  rural  poor  households.  Most  poor  rural  households  in 
southern  Zambia  will  have  inadequate  income  to  meet  their  daily  food  requirements  as 
this will be a second consecutive season of reduced harvest for most of them.

3.3. LIVESTOCK AND FISHERIES 
 

 

The  fisheries  and  livestock  sectors  remain  critical  in  achieving  sustainable  economic 
growth and reducing poverty in Zambia. This is because the country has immense natural 
resources  such  as  land,  water  and  favourable  climate  to  support  fisheries  and  livestock 
production. 
 
Despite  the  huge  potential  possessed  by  the  fisheries  and  the  Livestock  sectors,  the  two 
sectors have not performed to the expectations of many stakeholders.  Both sectors have 
experienced  low  production  and  productivity  resulting  from  a  range  of  factors  such  as 
diseases,  weather  variability,  insufficient  financing,  weak  extension  delivery  systems, 
lack of improved livestock and fish breeding stock, and high demand especially for fish, 
among many others. 
 

 

30 

Livestock Development 

 
Livestock production is a source of livelihood for small scale farmers in many parts of the 
country. The production of major livestock such as cattle, goats and pigs is concentrated 
in four provinces, namely Southern, Western, Eastern and Central provinces. The RALS 
2015  results  shows  that  the  most  common  type  of  livestock  owned  by  the  majority  of 
households  are  chickens  followed  by  cattle  and  then  goats.  On  average,  more  than  80 
percent of the households reported that they had at least one chicken, 35 percent owned 
goats,  31percent  cattle  and  only  16  percent  reported  owning  pigs.    The  survey  also 
showed that participation in livestock markets among smallholder farmers in Zambia was 
generally  low.  Among  those  who  raise  livestock,  sales  of  small  livestock  was  more 
common. For most, smallholders’ livestock acts as some form of insurance against poor 
weather and subsequent crop failure while also providing the farmers with income during 
difficult times. 
 
Cattle  production  is  disrupted  by  recurring  disease  outbreaks,  with  the  common  ones 
being  Foot  and  Mouth  Disease  (FMD),  East  Coast  Fever,  Contagious  Bovine  Pleural-
pneumonia  (CBPP)  and  Anthrax.  The  FMD  is  endemic  in  Sesheke  (Western  Province), 
Kazungula  (Southern  Province),  Mbala  and  Nakonde  (Northern  Province),  but  in  2004 
spread  to  parts  of  Central  and  other  districts  in  Southern  Province.  CBPP  is  endemic  in 
some  areas  of  Western,  North-  western,  provinces,  Kazungula  district  in  Southern 
province  and  extreme  Northern  Province  Districts.  East  Coast  Fever  areas  include 
Eastern,  Southern,  Central,  Lusaka  and  Northern  Provinces  while  outbreaks  of  Anthrax 
are  mostly  confined  to  Western  Province.  The  country  also  experiences  sporadic 
outbreaks of African swine fever.  
 
Poultry production increased by 19.2 percent from 146,000,000 in 2014 to 174,000,000 in 
2015.  Egg  production  grew  by  15  percent  from  1,058,  000  eggs  produced  in  2014  to 
1,217,000 produced in 2015. The per capita annual egg consumption increased to above 
68  eggs  in  2015.  Milk  production  increased  by  13.2  percent  from  463,020,000  litres  in 
2014  to  524,000,000  litres  in  2015.  Beef  production  registered  8  percent  growth  from 
32,800 tons in 2014 to 35,400 tons in 2015.

Disease Control and Prevention 

The  Ministry  in  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Health  managed  to  control  the 
outbreak  of  Plague  in  Humans  in  Nyimba  District  through  Community  awareness 
campaigns.  The  Ministry  vaccinated  594,038  animals  against  FMD  in  Central,  Lusaka, 
Southern  and  Western  Provinces  while  60,624  calves  were  immunized  against  ECF  in 
Eastern and Southern Provinces. Poultry vaccination against Newcastle disease increased 
by 52 percent from 853,546 birds in 2014 to 1,783,411 birds in 2015. 
 

Fisheries Development 

Aquaculture Development  

The  main  fish  farming  production  systems  applied  in  Zambia  are  cage  and  ponds. 
Aquaculture production in Zambia has increased from about 4,500 metric tons in 2005 to 
20,000  metric  tons  2014.  It  has  been  estimated  that  the  country  has  the  potential  to 
expand annual aquaculture production to more than 80,000 metric tons by the year 2021 
if  right  interventions  are  put  in  place.  Some  potential  areas  for  aquaculture  investments 
include  Rufunsa,  Kasempa,  Mungwi,  and  the  Kariba,  Tanganyika  Mweru-Luapula  and 
Bangweulu  lakes  which  are  suitable  for  promotion  of  cage,  pen  and  land-based 
production.  
There  was  an  18  percent  increase  in  aquaculture  production  from  19,241MT  in  2014  to 
22,713  MT  in  2015.  This  increase  could  be  attributed  to  increased  production  mainly 
from  commercial  fish  farmers  in  both  cage  and  pond.  Further,  a  total  of  516,053 
fingerlings  were  sold  from  the  Government  research  stations  representing  a  40  percent 
increase over 2014. 
 
Capture Fishery Development 
 
Fishing  in  Zambia  is  dominated  by  artisanal  fishers  using  traditional  vessels.  They  are 
found in all the country's fisheries and waterways and contribute to most of the national 
production.  In addition,  there are between 50 and 100 industrial  operators found mainly 
on Lakes Kariba and Tanganyika. Annual fisheries production increased from 40,000 MT 
per year in the late 1960s to over 80,826 MT in 2004 and is expected to increase in 2016 
due to increased fish catches on the Bangweulu, Mweru Luapula and Tanganyika fishery 
areas.  Per  capita  output  has  declined  from  11.4  kg  in  the  1970s  to  6.4  kg  in  2003  as  a 
result  of  increased  demand  on  account  of  the  increasing  population  in  the  country. 
Between 1999 and 2014, approximately 30,000 artisanal fishers accounted for 85 percent 
of catch, while industrial producers are mainly associated with the production of pelagic 
species  on  Lake  Tanganyika  (kapenta  and  Lates  sp.)  and  Lake  Kariba  (kapenta), 
accounting for the remaining 15 percent. The Bangweulu and Tanganyika fisheries of the 
Congo  Basin  are  most  productive,  accounting  for  43  percent  of  annual  production  in 
2014.  
 
Zambia's  capture  fisheries,  such  as  tropical,  multi-species  fisheries  in  general  are  very 
resilient and will continue to produce fish at more or less the same level of biomass. Fish 
stock  enhancement  (fish  re-stocking)  programmes  in  Mweru-wantipa,  Bangweulu  and 
Mweru-Luapula  continue  to  involve  stakeholders  in  fisheries  collaborative  management 
(fisheries  co-management).  This  includes  promoting  and  embracing  collaborative 
management through the traditional chiefs, headmen and other civic leaders.  
 

 

32 

Capture  fishery  production  increased  by  3.58  percent  from  80,826MT  to  83,719  MT  in 
2015.  Further,  there  was  1.31  percent  increase  in  the  number  of  fishers  from  72,053  in 
2014 to 72,998 in 2015 across the 14 fishery areas.  
 

3.3 Health 
The  Zambian  Government  identifies  health  as  one  of  the  most  significance  sectors  that 
contribute  to  the  health  and  safety  of  the  country.  It  therefore,  remains  dedicated  to 
providing quality health services to all its citizens. Knowing that a healthy population is 
fundamental  to  improved  efficiency  and  productivity,  Zambia  will  carry  on  investing  in 
the  health  sector  in  order  to  guarantee  sustainability  of  the  state’s  human  resource, 
essential  for  maintenance  of  economic  development.  The  government  recognizes  that 
extreme  weather  events  mainly  due  to  climate  change  are  increasingly  threatening 
people’s  lives,  health,  property,  and  livelihoods,  and  is  therefore,  developing  a  multi-
sectoral response to reduce vulnerability and build resilience to the health impact of this 
phenomenon.  
 
Public health emergency preparedness and response has been defined as “the capability of 
the health care systems, communities, and individuals, to prevent, protect against, quickly 
respond to, and recover from health emergencies, particularly those whose scale, timing, 
or  unpredictability  threatens  to  overwhelm  routine  capabilities”).  1Public  health 
preparedness  planning  is  a  multidisciplinary  endeavor  that  draws  on  traditional  public 
health expertise as well as the experience and skills of experts from other sectors such as 
agriculture,  environmental  science,  engineering,  education,  communication,  economics, 
and the social and behavioral scientists. 
 
The Zambian government continues to implement a comprehensive health sector reform 
program,  directed  at  realizing  equity  of  access  to  cost-effective  quality  health  care,  as 
close  to  the  family  as  possible.  The  reforms  are  centered  on  the  uninterrupted  five-year 
National  Health  Strategic  Plans  (NHSPs)  and  medium-term  expenditure  frameworks 
(MTEF). 
 
Currently,  the  Government  has  started  implementing  the  National  Health  Strategic  Plan 
2016  to  2020  (NHSP  2016-2020).  The  NHSP  2016-20  shall  be  incorporated  into  the 
Seventh National Development Plan 2016 to 2021, and linked to Zambia’s Vision 2030.  
 
Zambia has a high disease burden, which is mainly characterized by high prevalence and 
impact  of  communicable  diseases,  particularly,  malaria,  HIV  and  AIDS,  STIs,  and  TB, 
and high maternal, neonatal and child morbidities and mortalities. It also faces a growing 
challenge  of  Non-Communicable  Diseases  (NCDs),  including  mental  health,  cancers, 
sickle cell anaemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and heart diseases, chronic respiratory 
disease, blindness and eye refractive defects and oral health problems. 

The  country  has  one  of  the  highest  adolescent  fertility  rates  in  the  world  being  at 
141/1000 live births with 29 percent of adolescent women age 15-19 are already mothers 
or  pregnant  with  their  first  child.  Marriage  occurs  relatively  early  in  Zambia  with  the 
2013-2014  ZDHS  reviewing  that  among  women  age  25-49,  45  percent  marry  by  age 
18.Total fertility rate is still high in spite of slight decline from 6.5 percent in 1992, and

6.2  in  2007  to  5.3  percent  in  2013-14,  with  high  unmet  need  for  family  planning  at  22 
percent  in  2013-2014.The  report  indicates  high  rates  of  gender  based  violence  with  47 
percent  of  ever-married  women  aged  15-49  years  report  ever  having  experienced 
physical, sexual, and/or emotional violence from their current or most recent husband or 
partner and 31 percent reported having experienced such violence in the 12 months prior 
to the survey. 

 
Presently,  the  top  10  causes  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  Zambia  include  malaria, 
respiratory  infections  (non-pneumonia  and  pneumonia),  diarrhoea  (non-blood),  trauma 
(accidents,  injuries,  wounds  and  burns),  eye  infections,  skin  infections,  respiratory 
infections, ear, nose and throat  infections, intestinal  worms  and anaemia. The burden of 
the HIV&AIDS epidemic is also high, which has significantly impacted on the morbidity 
and mortality levels across the nation. 
 
Deprived  access  to  safe  water  and  good  sanitation,  poor  housing  and  unsafe  food  has 
continued to drive numerous diseases. Insufficient access to water and sanitation facilities 
accompanied  by  poor  hygiene  is  associated  with  skin  diseases,  acute  respiratory 
infections  (ARIs),  and  diarrhea  diseases,  the  leading  preventable  diseases.  ARI  and 
diarrhea  diseases  are  among  the  leading  causes  of  child  deaths  in  Zambia.  The  Zambia 
Demographic  and  Health  Survey  2013-14  (ZDHS  2013-14)  indicates  that  only  64.5 
percent  of  the  households  in  Zambia  have  access  to  improved  sources  of  water. 
Households  in  urban  areas  are  more  likely  to  have  access  to  improved  sources  of  water 
than those in rural areas (89.5 percent compared with 46.6 percent). Overall, 54 percent of 
households  in  Zambia  have  no  toilet  facilities.  This  problem  is  more  common  in  rural 
areas (74.2 percent) than in urban areas (27 percent). 
 
The health sector however, over seven years, from 2008 to 2013/14, recorded significant 
progress in most of the key areas of health service delivery, and health support systems, 
leading  to  major  improvements  in  most  of  the  key  health  performance  indicators. 
According to the ZDHS 2014, Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) reduced from 591 deaths 
per 100,000 live births in 2007 to 398 deaths per 100,000 in 2014, Under-Five Mortality 
Rate  (U5MR)  reduced  from  119  per  1000  live  births  in  2007  to  75  in  2014,  and  Infant 
Mortality  Rate  (IMR)  from  70  to  45  per  1000  live  births,  and  Neonatal  Mortality  Rate 
(NMR)  reduced  from  34  to  24  per  1000  live  births.  During  the  same  period,  HIV 
prevalence in adults, aged 15 to 49 years, reduced from 14.3 percent to 13 percent. There 
has also been notable progress in contraceptive prevalence rates having increased from 33 
percent in 2007 to 45 percent in 2013-14. There has also been progress in births assisted 
by skilled attendants having increased from 47 percent in 2007 to 64 percent in 2013-14. 
Overall  there  have  been  significant  improvements  in  health  indicators  over  a  20-year 
period as evidenced by the ZDHS of 1992 to 2013. 
 
In  order  to  consolidate  and  build  upon  the  achievements  of  the  NHSP  2011-15,  the 
Ministry  of  Health  (MOH),  in  partnership  with  the  key  sector  stakeholders  and 
development  partners,  are  the  in  process  of  developing  a  new  NHSP.  This  document 
seeks  to  provide  the  strategic  framework  for  the  efficient  and  effective  organisation, 
coordination  and  management  of  the  health  sector  in  Zambia.  This  is  aimed  at  further 
improving the health status of the Zambian population, in line with the national, regional 
and global health strategies and goals, particularly Zambia’s Vision 2030, the AU Africa 
Health  Strategy  (2016-2030),  and  the  United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals 
(SDGs).  The  health  response  to  climate  change  and  disaster  seeks  to  build  on  the 
strategies identified and outlined in these key strategies.

3.4 Nutrition 
 
Zambia is one of the many African countries with the highest burden of under nutrition in 
children under five. Thousands of children and women suffer from one or more forms of 
malnutrition, including low birth weight, wasting, stunting and underweight and multiple 
micronutrient  deficiencies  such  as  vitamin  A,  Iron,  Zinc  and  Iodine  deficiencies. 
Although Zambia is making some progress in addressing the high levels of malnutrition, 
the  indicators  for  under  nutrition  have  remained  high  and  well  above  the  World  Health 
Organization (WHO) thresholds. Over nutrition is also on the rise in Zambia. Overweight 
and  obesity  is  gradually  becoming  a  problem,  making  Zambia  have  a  double  burden  of 
malnutrition. 
 
It  should  be  noted  that  under  nutrition  including  micronutrient  deficiencies  can  easily 
occur  or  made  worse  if  they  are  already  present  during  an  emergency  situation.  This 
results  from  food  insecurity  due  to  loss  of  crops  and  animal  and  compromised 
environment  leading  to  diseases  such  as  diarrhoea2.  Since  good  nutrition  especially 
micronutrient  determine  birth  outcome,  health  and  development  of  infants  and  young 
children care should be taken to ensure that it is addressed during emergencies. 
 
 
It  is  globally  recognized that adequate  nutrition  is  the pillar of any social and economic 
developmental  programme  for  any  country  and  has  the  potential  to  reduce  poverty.  The 
government  of  Zambia  is  aware  that  investment  in  nutrition  for  its  people  and  in 
particular for infants, young children and women is essential for future development: The 
following sub-sections describe the key  challenges of nutrition in  Zambia which require 
concerted  efforts  of  all  different  actors  interested  in  nutrition  to  reduce  hunger  and 
poverty. 
 
Stunting 
 
According to the Demographic Health Survey (ZDHS 2013-2014), Chronic malnutrition 
(stunting) among children below the age of 5 years stands at 40 percent, with 17 percent 
severely  stunted.  The  same  survey  indicates  that  stunting  is  more  in  children  below  the 
age of 24 months (54 percent). Stunting is also being seen in children below the age of six 
(6)  months  (14  percent)3.  Stunting  among  Zambian  children  starts  in  early  months, 
rapidly increases after six (6) months of age and reaches the peak of 54 percent at 18 to 
23 months of age. This trend is due to poor quality of complementary feeds provided to 
the children after 6 months of age4.

Wasting 
According  to  the  ZHDS  2013-2014,  Zambia  has  consistently  maintained  the  wasting 
levels  among  children  under  five  between  5  percent  and  6  percent  from  1992  to  2014 
period  which  shows  a  peak  at  9  to  11  months  of  age.  Wasting  prevalence  in  Zambia 
varies slightly between urban (4 percent) and rural children (6 percent). 
 
Under weight  
 
The  ZDHS  2013-2014  shows  that  the  prevalence  of  underweight  among  children  under 
five years of age in Zambia has decreased from 25 percent in 1992 to 15 percent in 2014. 
Underweight (BMI <18.5) of women of the reproductive age group stands at 10 percent, 
while  the  most  affected  children  are  infants  below  24  months  (10  percent)5.  The 
prevalence is slightly higher among children in rural areas (16 percent) compared to those 
in urban areas (13 percent). 
 
Under nutrition among women  
 
Zambia has recorded almost a static level of under-nutrition (10 percent) among women 
of child bearing age since the 1990s. But this is not the case for overweight/obesity which 
increased from 12 percent in 1992 to 23 percent in 2014 (ZDHS 2013-2014). Malnutrition 
(under and over) affects the well-being of women reducing among others, their ability to 
provide the most needed care practices that promote the health of their families especially 
children.  When  child  care  is  compromised,  it  affects  the  future  reproductive  and 
productive  outcomes  of  an  individual  and  ultimately  the  overall  development  of  the 
country.   
 
Micronutrient malnutrition 
In  Zambia,  micronutrient  deficiencies  are  highly  prevalent  among  infants  and  young 
children  aged  6-24  months  and  pregnant  and  lactating  women.  The  most  common 
micronutrient  deficiencies  include  Vitamin  A,  iron,  and  zinc.  The  2003  survey  on 
micronutrient  malnutrition  showed  that  53.3  percent  of  children  and  13.4  percent  of 
women were deficient.  In terms  of iron deficiency  anaemia, this remains a major public 
health  concern.  Prevalence  of  anaemia  was  55.0  percent  among  under-five  children  with 
children  below  two  years  reporting  the highest  levels  of  anaemia6.  The survey done in  Nyimba 
and Mkushi in 2011 consistently showed 57 percent of the children 24 to 59 months were 
Vitamin A deficient7.  
 
Causes of poor nutritional status in Zambia  

The  causes  of  malnutrition  has  been  associated  with  many  poor  food  and  nutrition 
practices,  food  insecurity  and  poor  environmental  aspects  occurring  at  different  periods 
along  the  life  cycle.  Evidence  show  that  malnutrition  starts  way  back  in  pregnancy8

mostly due to poor nutrition of the mother. Poor maternal nutrition may result in low birth 
weight  babies  who  may  continue  with  poor  growth  if  the  care  and  feeding  practices 
provided  to  them  is  suboptimal.  The  effects  of  poor  nutrition  are  worsened  further  in 
times of emergencies including moderate events.  

The UNICEF conceptual frame work illustrates how malnutrition occurs. It groups casual 
factors  into  immediate,  underlying  and  basic  causes.  The  immediate  factors  hinge  on 
individual  behaviours  of  inadequate  dietary  intake  and  disease.  These  stem  from  the 
underlying factors of household food insecurity, inadequate care for women and children, 
unhealthy household environments and lack of health services. The prevailing policies in 
the country, infrastructure and social cultural norms (basic factors) shape the underlying 
casual  factors9.  The  framework  further  reveals  how  addressing  malnutrition  requires  a 
multi-sectoral approach10 even during emergency situations. For  instance, improvements 
in  maternal  and  child  health,  disease  burden  and  environmental  aspects;  and  in  distal 
factors such as poverty alleviation and reducing social inequalities would have a positive 
effect on the nutrition status of the society11 
 
The  Zambian  diet  has  an  over-reliance  on  maize  which  is  not  only  insufficient  to  fulfil 
energy  needs  and  diversity  but  also  not  able  to  meet  adequate  quantity  and  quality  of 
protein  and  micronutrient.  A  study  by  NFNC12  showed  that  rural  areas  could  only 
consume  4  out  of  the  13  food  groups  depicting  poor  diet  diversity.  In  addition,  the 
Zambian diet is mainly vegetarian. Study results show that 27 percent to 65 percent of the 
population  cannot  afford  a  minimum  cost  of  a  nutritionally  adequate  diet.  Further,  the 
increased disease burden in the community affects the consumption and causes the loss of 
essential micronutrient in the body contributing to under nutrition.  
 
Current interventions to address under nutrition 
 
Addressing of malnutrition in Zambia has taken a multi-sectoral approach as highlighted 
above which being supported by strong coordinating structures at various levels is aimed 
at bringing all key  players in food and nutrition to act  effectively. This approach is  also 
supported by the food and nutrition policy of 2006 as well  as the policy implementation 
plan and the food and nutrition strategic plan of 2011 to 2016. One of the main focus of 
the  strategies  is  the  reduction  of  stunting  among  children  under  the  age  of  three  years 
through the 1000 MCDP13.

3.5. Water and Sanitation 
A larger proportion of disasters experienced in most parts of the country are attributed to 
floods and droughts. The frequent occurrence of these disasters has a negative bearing on 
both  water  quantity  and  quality.  It  is  therefore,  common  knowledge  that  inadequate 
access to water results in increased cases of disease incidences and in some cases death. 
Further,  lack  of  hygiene  can  contribute  to  disease  outbreaks  such  as  typhoid,  cholera, 
measles and diarrhea.   

Sustainable  development  can  only  be  achieved  when  key  components  of  Water, 
Sanitation  and  Hygiene  (WASH)  are  considered.  The  country’s  vision  for  water  as 
reflected  in  the  Revised  Sixth  National  Development  Plan  (R-SNDP,  2013-2016)  is  to 
ensure  that  all  Zambians  access  safe  water  and  sanitation  as  well  as  efficient  and 
sustainable  water  utilization  for  wealth  creation  and  betterment  of  livelihoods  by  2030. 
Access  to  WASH  is  a  key  public  health  and  socioeconomic  issue,  especially  in  many 
rural districts and peri-urban areas in the country. WASH still remains a sector with great 
potential to improve health, life-expectancy, gender equity, as well as other key drivers of 
development.  

The Current Situation and Challenge 

The El Niño effects experienced during the 2015/2016 rainfall season triggered prolonged 
dry spells which consequently affected the water flow and/or water levels in river basins 
resulting  in  increased  load  shedding  from  the  energy  perspective  as  well  as  inadequate 
supply for domestic and industrial use.  

Suffice to mention that every Zambian citizen should have access to clean and safe water 
sufficient  to  meet  basic  needs,  including  drinking,  cooking  and  sanitation.  The  National 
Water  Policy  (2010)  and  the  Water  Resources  Management  Act  (2011)  introduced  the 
principles  of  Integrated  Water  Resources  Management  (IWRM  and  provides  new 
institutional and legal framework for the management of water resources in Zambia. The 
sector  has  prioritized  infrastructure  development  in  rural  areas  in  order  to  improve  the 
livelihood of the rural population where the majority of the poor live. The sector is also 
developing the National Water Supply and Sanitation Policy that will  facilitate effective 
development and management of the water supply, sanitation and solid waste subsector in 
Zambia. The Water Supply and Sanitation Act No. 28 of 1997 will also be reviewed.  
 
According to the 2013-14 ZDHS, the proportion of people using improved drinking water 
source  at  national  level  is  89.2  percent  for  urban  and  46  percent  for  rural.  Further,  the 
proportion  of  population  with  access  to  improved  sanitation  at  national  level  is  39.2 
percent  for  urban  and  19.7  percent  for  rural.  Despite  this  positive  gain  in  the  WASH 
coverage, no progress was made in terms of meeting the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) by end of 2015.  
 
The WASH solutions 
 
Since  2013  to  date,  the  sector  is  increasingly  implementing  WASH  infrastructure 
development  and  management  programmes  outlined  in  the  Revised  SNDP  and  the 
Integrated  Water  Resources  Management  and  Water  Efficiency 
(IWRM/WE) 
Implementation Plan (2007 to 2030) in order to complement the 2030 vision of clean and 
safe water supply  and sanitation for all (target  100 percent for water and  90 percent for 
sanitation). Thus, the various infrastructural and management projects and programmes in 
the water sector embarked on by GRZ stakeholders and cooperating partners such as GIZ, 
BGR,  World  Bank  and  AfDB,  are  fundamentally  aimed  at  addressing  inadequate  water 
38 

 

supplies  to  meet  various  needs,  pollution,  insufficient  information  for  decision  making, 
inefficient use of the water resource and limited stakeholder awareness and participation.  
For  the  government  to  achieve  the  set  targets  in  water  resources  development  and 
management  and  in  water  supply  and  sanitation,  the  government  through  the  revised 
SNDP  projected  investment  in  Water  and  Sanitation  Infrastructure  development  for  the 
period 2013 to 2016 as shown in Table 6 below:

CHAPTER FOUR:  FINDINGS 

4.1 General Demographics 
The demographic characteristics of the assessed households cover issues such as gender, 
age  and  marital  status  of  household  heads  in  the  assessed  districts.  This  section  further 
covers  issues  relating  to  levels  of  education  attained  by  household  heads,  employment 
status as well as household size and dependence ratio in the assessed districts. 

The 2016  In-depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment was mainly rural based with 92 
percent  of  the  households  residing  there  compared  to  8  percent  residing  in  urban  areas. 
Compared to the 2015 in-depth assessment where 74 percent of the assessed households 
were male headed  while the rest  were female headed, the 2016 in-depth  assessment has 
shown  that  50  percent  of  the  assessed  households  were  female  headed  and  50  percent 
were  male  headed  households.  The  assessment  further  showed  that  in  terms  of  age,  the 
age of the majority of the assessed household heads (26 percent) ranged between 31- 40 
years  followed  by  those  aged  between  41-  50  years  at  22  percent  while  the  those  aged 
between 21- 30 years accounted for 17 percent and those over 60 years stood 17 percent.   

The assessment revealed that the majority (44 percent) of the households in the surveyed 
district  were  married,  40  percent  were  single,  widowed  (4  percent)  while  the  rest  were 
either divorced or separated. On the education level attained by the household heads, the 
assessment report indicated that majority (58 percent) of the household heads interviewed 
had  attained  at  least  primary  education.  Furthermore,  the  assessment  indicated  that  21 
percent  of  the  household  heads  had  reached  secondary  level,  2  percent  had  attained 
tertiary  education  while  15  percent  of  the  households  had  no  formal  education.  School 
going children on the other hand accounted for 41 percent.  

The assessment revealed that most of the household heads (41percent) were unemployed 
compared to 22 percent that were informally employed. The survey indicated that most of 
the  households  were  involved  in  some  kind  of  generating  activities  which  is  a  good 
indicator for resilience. 

The  assessment  showed  that  majority  (50  percent)  of  the  households  had  household 
members ranging from 4- 8 followed by household sizes between 1- 4 at 40 percent and 9 
percent  accounting  for  household  sizes  between  9-  12.  The  survey  further  showed  that 
most of the households were keeping orphans with the majority being single orphans (9 
percent)  while  double  orphans  accounted  for  2  percent  with  the  dependency  ration  at  7 
percent.  In  terms  of  chronic  illness  and  disability,  the  chronic  illness  incidence  was  2 
percent while the disability prevalence level stood at 1 percent.  

 

4.2. Early Warning 
The  assessment  results  have  shown  that  71  percent  of  the  surveyed  districts  indicated 
having  provided  early  warning  to  the  communities  in  the  affected  districts  about  the 
impending  hazard  (prolonged  dry  spells).  Generally,  there  has  been  an  improvement  in 
the number of districts receiving early warning compared to last season when it was just 
26 percent.  
 
Climate  related  early  warning  information  is  generated  by  Zambia  Meteorological 
Department  who disseminates it not  only to  institutions but also the general  public. The 
major  source  of  information  dissemination  on  the  early  warning  for  the  communities  in 

40 

 

the  assessed  districts  was  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  (30  percent)  followed  by 
Department  of  Water  Affairs  (26  percent).  Others  included  Meteorological  Department, 
District  Disaster  Management  Committee  (DDMC)  and  NGOs.    The  major  mode  of 
dissemination  was  radio  followed  by  meetings  and  verbal  communication  as  shown  in 
Figure 2 below. 
 

Figure 2: Mode of Communication Used 

 

 

4.3. Livelihoods 
The strong El Nino effects experienced during most parts of 2015-16 rainfall season did 
to  some  extent  affect  people’s  livelihoods.  The  livelihood  analysis  is  key  in  that  it  will 
help  ascertain  means  in  which  people  maintain  access  to  essential  resources  for  their 
ultimate  survival.  So  far  the  results  on  the  general  livelihoods  have  remained  consistent 
with the recent Living Conditions Monitoring Survey which has put agriculture (crop and 
Livestock)  as  the  most  common  livelihood  source  for  most  households  in  the  assessed 
districts  followed  by  trading  and  formal  employment.  The  survey  showed  that  the  main 
livelihoods  of  the  people  in  the  assessed  districts  were  farming  (crop  and  livestock 
production), trading, fishing, formal employment and agriculture labour.  

Suffice  to  mention  that  there  were  no  major  changes  observed  in  the  livelihoods  of  the 
households  in  the  assessed  districts  (trend  remained  the  same  when  compared  to  same 
period last year) as shown in Figure 3 below.

4.4. Asset Ownership  

Analysis  of  asset  ownership  for  either  community  or  households  is  critical  as  it 
determines the resilience capacity to prepare for and/or resist shocks. This section 
therefore focuses on two forms of asset analysis that is Asset Wealth Index (AWI) 
and Household Asset Scores (HAS). Both look at the number of assets owned but 
the latter also focuses on functionality of the asset owned.  

           Figure 4: Asset Ownership 

 

The analysis on the AWI 
has  shown  that  majority 
of  the  households  in  the 
asssessed  districts  are 
generally  poor  with  49 
percent 
asset 
medium  and  41  percent 
asset  poor.  There  are 
however households that

This  basically  implies  that  those  households  under  ‘Asset  Poor’category  are  less 
resilient or more likelily to be negatively impacted by shocks such as the El Nino 
which characterized much of the 2015/16 rainfall season.

Analysis on the number of functional assets owned by rural/urban strata within the 
assessed  districts  have  shown  the  mean  Household  Asset  Score  (HAS)  for  the 
rural  stratum 
(2.23  and  1.79 
respectively).Further  analysis  has  shown  that  ownership  of  various  functional 
assets  owned  by  most  households    across  the  assessed  districts  did  not  change 
much in terms of numbers when comparing 2016 and last year same period. This 
basically  implies  that  households  did  not  embark  on  disposing  off  assets  to 
mitigate effects of the bad start of the rainfall season.

4.5. Agriculture and Food Security 
The  discussion  in  this  chapter  focuses  on  agricultural  production  (crop  and  livestock), 
food availability and access.  

 

4.5.1. Land Availability and Cultivation  
The  results  of  the  assessment  showed  that  87  percent  of  the  households  in  the  assessed 
districts  had  access  to  arable  land  with  Mongu  and  Siavonga  indicating  the  least 
percentage at 61 percent, this could be attributed to the partly urban area of Mongu while 
for  Siavonga  it  can  be  attributed  to  actual  land  scarcity  due  to  the  ragged  terrain.  The 
average  land  holding  in  the  districts  stood  at  3  hectares  per  household.  Districts  in 
Southern,  Western  and  Central  provinces  had  the  largest  landholding  amongst  the 
assessed  areas  with  Nkeyema,  Chisamba  and  Luano  having  8.78,  7.6  and  6.98  hectares 

 

43 

respectively  while  the  smallest  average  available  land  holding  was  in  Luangwa,  Mongu 
and Sikongo with 0.61, 0.63 and 0.81 hectares respectively. Most households in Western 
Province districts apart from Nkeyema showed the smallest landholdings.   
 
The  results  also  showed  that  households  in  the  assessed  districts  had  access  to  arable 
land averaging 3.2 hectares in 2015/2016 agriculture season. Further, results showed that 
the  majority  of  households  are  not  utilizing  their  arable  land  fully  due  to  primarily 
drought and the lack of inputs.  

 

4.5.2. Food Availability  
 
Results on crop production indicate that 78 percent of the households grew crops and of 
these  80  percent  grew  maize,  followed  by  19.5  percent  who  grew  groundnuts,  sweet 
potatoes (11 percent), cassava (9.6 percent), sunflowers (6.3 percent), millet ( 6.2 percent) 
and sorghum at 5.6 percent. As the data shows, maize growing is dominant in almost all 
the  districts.  Production  of  Maize  in  2015/2016  season  is  631,  923  MT  from  the  42 
Districts.  The  assessment  showed  that  the  households  anticipate  selling  about  196,053 
MT of maize. It was also determined that the amount to be given away stood at 703 MT. 
The total balance of the maize likely to be held at the household level therefore stood at 
407,049 MT. Further, results have shown a reduction of 34 percent in the overall maize 
production  in  the  assessed  districts  this  year  compared  to  last  year.  The  highest  decline 
was observed in Southern province (48 percent) while the least was in Western province 
(8  percent).  (Figure  6).  Of  the  districts  that  experienced  reductions  in  production, 
Luangwa  had  the  highest  decline  of  83  percent  while  6  districts  in  Western  province 
recorded  an  increase  in  production  compared  to  the  2014/15  production  which  in 
retrospect was also not a good season. 
 
Figure 6: Comparison of Maize Production 2014/15 Vs 2015/16 

the  2015/2016  season  were  dry  spells  (38  percent), 

Results  from  the  assessment  showed  that  the  main  reasons  limiting  household  crop 
production  for 
lack  of 
fertiliser/manure (14 percent), lack of seed (10.6 percent), inadequate labour (8.2 percent) 
lack  of  draught  power  (7.7  Percent)  and  not  enough  land  available  (4.5  percent).  In 
addition,  data  indicated  that  only  15  percent  of  the  households  practice  Conservation

Agriculture.  Adoption  of  Conservation  Agriculture  helps  mitigate  against  effects  of  dry 
spells  and  ensures  sustainable  yields  in  light  of  climate  change  and  climate  variability. 
The high cost of fertilizer and seed was the main constraint as to why households did not 
access  farming  inputs.  As  a  result,  households  that  could  not  access  improved  seed 
resorted to using recycled seed which in the end compromises crop production potential. 
Main input sources were reported as FISP (35 percent), purchased (32 percent), previous 
harvest (26 percent) and gifts (4 percent). 

Figure 7: Reason for Limit to Production 

 

The other crops grown in the assessed districts included cotton, tobacco, sun flower, soya 
beans, sorghum, millet, sweet potatoes, rice, groundnuts and cassava. The cash crops such 
as  cotton,  tobacco  and  sun  flower  were  mainly  grown  in  Eastern,  Southern  and  Central 
Provinces.  Rice, sorghum and millet production increased generally while that of millet 
declined when compared to the previous season.

4.5.3. Conservation Agriculture  
It is clear that recurrence of climate related shocks such as droughts, prolonged dry spells 
and/or floods will continue to exert pressure on the main livelihood of most people in the 
assessed  districts  which  in  this  case  is  agriculture.  There  have  been  several  attempts 
through a number of projects to ensure increased adoption of climate smart agriculture

the  declining  soil  fertility,  high 
cost  in  accessing  appropriate 
inputs to mention a few. 

smart 

The  discussion  under 
this 
chapter focuses on Conservation 
Agriculture  (CA)  as  one  of  the 
climate 
technologies 
touching  on  all  three  (3)  key 
principles 
soil 
disturbance,  permanent  organic 
cover and crop rotation). In this 
regard the results showed that a 
number  of  households  from  the 
assessed  districts  did  not  use 
conservation  agriculture  farming  technique  during  the  2015/16  season  (83  percent). 
Within those households that practiced and/or used any of the three (3) CA key principles 
during the 2015/16 season, the results have shown that potholing was the lead approach 
(47.4 percent) followed  by ripping  (26.8 percent) and crop rotation (11 percent).  There 
were  households  however  that  used  intercropping  and  crop  cover  as  CA  approaches 
though  they  constituted  a  smaller  proportion  accounting  for  11  percent  and  8.1  percent 
respectively.

Figure 9: Comparative Analysis of CA by Province 

A  comparative  analysis  of 
the  CA 
practices  across  the  assessed  provinces 
have  shown  that  assessed  districts  in 
Lusaka  Province  had  most  households 
that adopted pot holing (30 percent) and 
crop  cover  (40  percent)  as  the  CA 
approach  during  2015/16  followed  by 
Eastern  Province.  This  is  largely  due  to 
most  fields  being  smaller  and  leaving 
the use of Chaka holes as an appropriate 
implement.  Consequently,  households 
from  the  assessed  districts  in  Southern 
Province  adopted  more  CA  farming 
techniques  than  other  provinces  with

holing  (18  percent)  and  inter  cropping,  that  is  mixing  legumes  with  maize  (14  percent). 
This  is  also  attributed  to  the  fact  that  most  of  the  arable  land  is  large  in  size  creating  a 
conducive  environment  to  practically  apply  the  three  (3)  CA  principles.  Further,  there 
have  been  a  number  of  projects  in  the  province  that  have  been  promoting  the  CA 
techniques  among  smallholder  farming  households  who  formed  the  majority  of 
households  assessed,  as  a  climate  risk  management  approach.  It  is  key  to  ensure  CA 
continues to be rolled out as it will help safe guard investments put in agriculture, keeping 
in mind that it will remain the main income earner for most households in these districts 
and province as a whole. 

4.5.4. Crop Storage Facilities and Food Types Preserved 

According  to  Tyler  and  Gilman,  agricultural  crop  losses  are  referred  to  as  measurable 
reduction in food stuffs which may affect either quantity or quality15. Postharvest losses 
still remain high among most smallholder farmers in Zambia and reasons vary depending 
on the economic status of the households. 

There  are  attempts  to  ensure  capacity  is  built  for  farming  households  to  start  investing 
less  expensive  but  durable  ways  to  safe  guard  their  produce.  This  section  of  the  report 
therefore attempts to highlight the common food storage types used by households in the 
assessed districts. In view of that, the results have shown that the commonly used storage 
facilities by households are houses (31.9 percent), open crib (25.1 percent), covered cribs 
with sides made of wood/branches (18.1 percent) and closed mud structure (13.8 percent). 
Almost all these storage options would not guarantee good quality.

Need  therefore  arises  to  start  investing  in  alternative  but  less  expensive  options  such  as 
building concrete covered cribs, metal silos, Pandew Improved Crop Storage bags (PICS) 
just to mention a few.

4.5.5. Livestock 
 
Livestock Availability 
 
On livestock, the Assessment results have shown that the main type of livestock owned in 
the  assessed  districts  were  chickens  (48.7  percent),  followed  by  cattle  (18.8  percent). 
Others  owned  were  goats  (16.6  percent),  pigeons  (5.7  percent)  and  guinea  fowls  (3.9 
percent),  pigs  (3.1  percent)  ducks  (2.5  percent),  sheep  (0.5  percent)  and  donkeys  (0.3 
percent). 
 
Figure 12: Types of Livestock kept by Households 

 
Livestock  is  a  major  contributor  to  food  security  through  increased  output  of  livestock, 
non-livestock  products,  employment  and  income  generation  thus  assure  access  to  food. 
However,  this  year’s  assessment  has  shown  that  livestock  production  reduced  for  most 
livestock  types.  Chickens  which  are  owned  by  mostly  small  holder  farmers  recorded  a 

 

 

48 

reduction by 36 percent from 7,539,827 in 2015 to 4,776,827. Cattle production reduced 
by 4.9 percent and goats by 12 percent (Table 7 below).  The main reason for a reduction 
in chicken numbers was death which can be attributed to disease outbreaks such as New 
castle.  There  were  increased  incidences  of  New  castle  disease  in  most  districts  this  past 
season  which  could  be  attributed  to  the  above  normal  temperature  that  prevailed  during 
the  dry  spells.  In  addition,  for  both  cattle  and  goats  death  was  the  main  reason  for 
reduction  in  numbers.  This  calls  for  intensified  efforts  in  disease  control  and  improved 
livestock management.

Livestock production 
 
According  to  the  survey  results,  pasture  availability  in  the  assessed  districts  was  less 
compared to the same period last year (Figure 13 below). In order to have good quality 
livestock and livestock products it is paramount to ensure access to good quality pasture 
all year round. Low livestock production and productivity by the traditional sector is due 
in  part  to  the  poor  nutritive  value  of  natural  pastures  (Kulich  and  Nambayo,  1988).  
Prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall had led to reduced  water  availability to  support 
pasture growth and hence reduced pasture available for livestock at the beginning of the 
season (November, 2016 through to mid-January, 2017). 
 

 

49 

Figure 13: Pasture availability compared to the same period last year 

 

 
 
  
As  a  result  of  inadequate  and  poor  pasture,  small  scale  farmers  in  the  traditional  sector 
that  depend  on  free  range  grazing  practices  will  be  forced  to  travel  longer  distances  or 
migrate  in  search  of  pasture  and  water  if  there  are  no  short  to  medium  term  response 
interventions.  The  survey  shows  that  36.6  percent  of  observed  households  moved  long 
distances or migrated in search of pasture and water for livestock, and the situation may 
worsen  during  the  period  from  July  to  November,  2016.  The  long  distances  to  good 
pasture  areas  may  increase  the  probability  of  livestock  contracting  diseases  due  to 
encroachments in game areas thereby increasing transmission (contagion) of diseases and 
animal fatigue. 
 
If prolonged dry conditions reoccur in future, only 16 percent of the households assessed 
reported  they  would  consider  migration.  Although  migration  is  not  necessarily  a  bad 
human decision because of its inherent opportunities it tends to divide and distort social 
capital and networks coupled with its initial economic costs that may be severe requiring 
a long time for affected households to recover. The assessment findings also indicate that 
some possible challenges that migrants would encounter if they had moved.  Accordingly, 
the  three  main  challenges  mentioned  were  farmland  for  cultivation  (65.2  percent), 
accommodation (28.4 percent) and livestock diseases (25.3 percent).  
 
 
Livestock Diseases 
 
Diseases  continue  to  be  a  major  challenge  to  livestock  productivity  despite  concerted 
efforts  by  the  government  immunization  campaigns.  Results  from  the  survey  at  district 
level  indicated  the  following  disease  incidences:  For  cattle  the  common  one  was  East 
Coast Fever, Newcastle for chicken, Mange for goats and African swine fever for pigs. 
 
 
4.5.6. Fisheries 
 
At  national  level,  natural  fisheries  contribute  90  percent  fish  production  of  the  average 
70,000  MT  to  85,000  MT  in  recent  past  with  the  other  10  percent  coming  from  fish 
farming.  Main  fisheries  in  the  assessed  districts  include  Lake  Kariba,  Zambezi  River, 
Itezhi-tezhi  dam,  Kafue  River,  and  Lukanga  Swamps.  Other  minor  fisheries  include, 
Lower Zambezi and Luangwa River. 
 

50 

 

Fish and fish-related products provide income and livelihoods for a number of households 
in the assessed districts. According to the assessment, 27.9 percent of all the communities 
interviewed,  were  engaged  in  fishing  activities.  Fish  production  contributes  to  the  rural 
economy  through  employment,  earnings  and  as  a  source  of  food.  The  effects  of  the  El 
Niño  phenomenon  in  the  2015/16  season  did  not  spare  the  fisheries  sub  sector  as 
evidenced from low water levels in water bodies (rivers, lakes, dams and ponds) leading 
to reduced fish catches.  Most of the responses (75 percent) indicated that fish catches had 
reduced  compared  to  the  same  time  last  year.  The  main  reason  given  (74  percent)  was 
reduced water levels in the water bodies. Although the reduction in fish catches has been 
gradual  over  the  years,  the  negative  effects  of  the  poor  rains  for  the  past  two  seasons 
could have aggravated the situation.  
 
 
4.5.7. Food Access 
 

Adequate  food  availability  at  the  national  or  district  level  does  not  in  itself  guarantee 
food  security  at  household  level.  Household  food  access  is  achieved  through  a 
combination of own production, exchange or purchases from the market, gifts obtained 
from the household’s social networks and fishing or gathering wild foods. Therefore, this 
section  discusses  access  in  terms  of  own  production,  social  access,  market  access; 
including  physical  access,  financial,  as  well  as  how  markets  impact  food  access  in 
achieving household food security objectives. 

 

Access to Own Production 

 

Out of the total maize produced, 407,049 MT will be retained by households. In terms of 
carryover  stocks,  only  24  percent  of  the  households  indicated  having  carryover  stocks 
from the previous year.  
 
Regarding  results  from  community  key  informant  interviews,  93  percent  indicated  that 
household own produced stocks will last for 6 months compared to a few (23 percent) in a 
good  year.  Out  of  this,  62  percent  indicated  that  stocks  will  last  for  3  months  or  less. 
Results  have  also  shown  that  by  November,  2016  which  is  the  start  of  the  lean  period, 
nearly  all  households  are  expected  to  run  out  of  own  produced  stocks  compared  to  56 
percent in a good year. 
 
Figure 14: Months Staple Food will Last 

While access to own produced food stocks 
varies depending on the livelihoods of the 
area  (Zambia  Livelihood  Profiles  2014), 
nearly all the districts reported a decline in 
number of months’ own production would 
last  in  comparison  to  a  good  year.  With 
limited  consumption  of  own  production, 
households  will  resort  to  markets  earlier 
than normal. Markets therefore will be key 
as 
in 
this  will 
household  food  access,  but 

they  will  play  a  greater  role 

depend on available incomes and staple food prices. 

 

 

51 

Physical Access 

 

In  the  community  informant  interviews,  46  percent  of  the  communities  indicated  that 
staple food was readily available at local markets while 54 percent indicated that it was 
not sufficient. And in terms of six months’ projection, 41 percent said markets would be 
sufficiently  supplied  while  59  percent  expect  insufficient  food  availability  in  the  local 
market.  On  source  of  staple  food  supply  to  markets,  there  was  an  equal  distribution 
where 50 percent indicated that supply was from within the community while another 50 
percent indicated that supply was from outside the district. Results further indicated that 
the main constraints in terms of physical access were distance to markets (75 percent). In 
addition, the community focus group discussions showed that households in the assessed 
districts  would  be  hindered  to  access  markets  mainly  due  to  long  distances  coupled  by 
bad  roads.  This  weakens  household  resilience  in  that  such  households  may  not  access 
main markets at the district where the price of the commodity may be cheaper than when 
obtained locally as observed in Sesheke where maize meal prices was 35 percent higher 
in the outlying communities in comparison to the price at the district center (FEWS NET 
Monitoring report, February, 2016). 

 

Financial Access 

 

Household  food  access  is  linked  to  incomes,  expenditure,  markets  and  prices. 
Households with financial capabilities resort to markets when own staple foods run out, 
as  indicated  in  the  assessment.  This  is  evident  where  27  percent  of  the  households 
purchased  staple  food  between  January  and  April,  2016.    Given  the  below  average 
production for majority of households in the assessed districts, the most poor households 
will  only  access  own  production  during  the  June  to  July,  2016  period  which  should 
reduce pressure on the market in the short term. When the lean season starts in October, 
2016 earlier than normal (November), there will be increased demand for food from the 
market  as  households  deplete  own  produced  stocks  contributing  to  increased  market 
prices for the staple food.  

 

Given  the  high  maize  and  maize  meal  price  levels  observed  in  the  2015/16  marketing 
season,  prices  are  likely  to  remain  above  the  five-year  average  throughout  the  2016/17 
marketing year and close to the levels that prevailed in the previous season (Figure 15) 
making  access  difficult  for  poor  households  with  inadequate  incomes.  Household 
income mainly  coming from sale of  crops reduced due impact  of prolonged dry spells, 
will  further  inhibit  households’  access  to  markets.  Prices  will  remain  atypically  high 
until February, 2017 when households begin to access green harvest which is expected to 
be at normal levels given the positive seasonal outlook of above average rainfall during 
the upcoming 2016/17 growing season due to an expected La Nina phenomenon. 

 

Government directed FRA to sell maize to millers at below market price to help stabilize 
maize  meal  prices  from  November  2015  to  March,  2016.  Although  in  the  past,  this 
intervention has kept prices relatively stable during the lean period, this was not the case 
in  the  previous  season  as  prices  for  maize  meal  rose  significantly  higher  than  5-year 
average. The expected above average prices will mean that most poor market dependent 
consumers are likely to have limited market access due to reduced purchasing power. In 
addition,  the  below  average  staple  food  production  in  the  region  is  likely  to  increase 
demand  for  Zambian  maize  and  maize  meal.  This  is likely  to  increase  informal  maize 
and  maize  meal  trade  and  smuggling,  and  put  pressure  on  local  staple  food  prices  as 

52 

 

experienced in the last marketing  year during March/April. This may lead to exorbitant 
staple  food  prices  that  will  further  limit  food  access  for  many  poor  market  dependent 
consumers.

In  addition  to  own  production  and  market  purchases,  households  access  staple  food 
through  labour  exchange,  gifts  and  relief.  Results  indicate  that  between  January  and 
April this year, 30 percent of the households acquired staple food through casual labour 
exchange. This  shows the importance of casual  labour as one source of staple food for 
poor households as such an assessment of availability of labour opportunities from better 
off households can provide further insight into how food security dynamics at household 
level will evolve. In addition, data indicated that 15 percent acquired food as gifts and 15 
percent  acquired  through  relief  programmes  with  majority  (73  percent)  from  food  for 
work and 22 percent from the general food distribution. For households that depended on 
relief this will be a second consecutive year that they are facing challenges in accessing 
food and may not have other sustainable alternatives to access staple food.  

4.6. Expenditure Share 
Analysis on the income sources and expenditure shares on food and non-food 
commodities still remains one of the critical components in understanding the economic 
vulnerabilities of households. The assessment results have shown that sale of agriculture

Committee (ZVAC). 

impact 

 

53 

However  Social  Cash  Transfers  (SCT)  as  one  of  the  income  sources  in  the 
assessed  districts  was  reported  and  accounted  for  6  percent  of  the  respondents. 
This  is  attributed  to  the  scale  up  of  the  existing  SCT  programme  in  terms  of 
geographical  coverage  with  majority  of  the  assessed  districts  being  under  the 
programme. 

It  is  however  worth  noting  that  there  is  high  level  of  economic  vulnerability 
among  the  assessed  households  as  the  main  income  source  (sale  of  crops)  is 
extremely  prone  to  climate  shocks  as  was  the  case  this  season.  This  has  been 
confirmed  by  most  District  Disaster  Management  Committees  in  the  assessed 
districts  that  indicated sale of crops (45 percent), remittance (4 percent) and sale 
of livestock (8 percent) as main income sources which were affected by prolonged 
dry spells in the 2015/16 rain season. 

This  certainly  will  affect  most  household’s  ability  to  interact  with  the  markets 
when  own  produced  food  runs  out  which  most  of  them  indicated  that  their  own 
produced food would take them only for three (3) months or less. 

                   Figure 17: Expenditure Share 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The analysis on expenditure share on food for the last thirty (30) days prior to the 
assessment  has  shown  that  fewer  households  spent  more  of  their  household 
incomes on food than other non-food commodities. In this regard, the results have 
shown  that  61  percent  of  households  from  the  assessed  districts  indicated 
spending 49 percent or less of their household income on food. In an addition, 16 
percent  of  households  indicated  spending  between  50  and  64  percent  of  their 
incomes on food. This trend is likely to change in some districts whose production 
will  not  cover  the  desirable  food  requirement  for  the  next  eight  (8)  months 
especially their main income source (agriculture) which was somewhat adversely 

54 

 

 

affected by the late start of the rains  due to  the strong El Nino , hence access  to 
food for the households in those districts will be a challenge.16 

Analysis  on  food  expenditure  share  across  the  gender  status  of  the  head  of 
households has shown that majority of the female headed households spent less on 
food 
than  on  non-food 
compared  to  male  headed 

Figure 18: Proportion of Households across Gender 
and Expenditure share

prior 

households  in  the  thirty 
days 
the 
assessment.  In  this  regard 
the results have shown that 
51.2  percent  of  the  female 
headed  households  in  the 
assessed  districts  spent  49 
percent  or  less  on  food 
than 
non-food 
commodities. 

 

This  in  itself  is  a  positive 
finding  as  much  of  them 
depend 
largely  on  own 
produced  food  and  hence 
have  capacity 
to  spend 
money  on  essential  non-food  commodities.  Suffice  to  mention  that  the  trend  on 
food  expenditure  share  across  gender  status  of  head  of  households  and  Asset 
Wealth Index strata was the same as majority of the households spent less that 50 
percent of their incomes on food. Asset ownership did to a larger extent enhance 
productivity  potential  for  these  households  to  invest  more  in  own  production  of 
food and lessen reliance on purchases as can be seen in Figure 19 below.

4.7. Food Consumption Scores (FCS) 

Figure 20: Food Consumption Score 

The food consumption analysis under this chapter has focused on two indicators, 
Food Consumption Score (FCS) and Food Consumption Score Nutrition (FCS-N). 
The  food  consumption  score 
basically  helps  inform  the 
nutrient  rich  food  groups 
consumed  by 
individuals 
and households at large. But 
because  the  FCS  does  not 
adequately 
provide 
information  on  main  macro 
(carbohydrates, 
nutrient 
proteins 
and 
micronutrient  (vitamins  and 
minerals), the 2016 assessment has therefore incorporated the Food Consumption 
Score Nutrition which will tease out the macro and micro nutrient adequacy. 
 

fats) 

and 

 

Figure 21: Food Consumption Score - Nutrition 

 

shown 

In this regard, the results 
have 
that 
majority  of  households 
generally  have 
fairly 
good  FCS  with  41 
having 
percent 
acceptable 
33 
and 
percent borderline. 
Further,  analysis  across 
the  gender  status  of  the 
heads  of  household  stratum  has  shown  that  most  female 
headed  households  had  better  food  consumption  scores  than  male  headed.  The 
results have shown that 41.9 percent and 33 percent of female headed households 
in  the  assessed  districts  have  acceptable  and  borderline  FCS  respectively 
compared  to  40.9  percent  (acceptable)  and  32.8  percent  (borderline)  from  male 
headed  households.  The  results  have  further  shown  that  the  proportion  of 
households  with  poor  FCS  was  higher  within  male  headed  households  (51.4 
percent)  compared  to  48.6  percent  from  female  headed  households.  This  trend 
however,  is  different  when  compared  to  last  year’s  impact  assessment    where 
more male headed households generally had better FCS (50.7 percent- acceptable, 
50.3  percent  –  borderline  and  49.4  percent  –  poor)  compared  to  female  headed 
households(49.3 percent- acceptable, 49.7 percent – borderline and 50.6 percent 
–  poor).This  attributed  to  male  headed  households    resorting  to  radical 
consumption strategies such as cutting down  on the  number of meals consumed 
in a day or consumption of less preferred foods poor in nutrients. 

 

 

56 

On the contrary, despite most households having fairly good consumption scores, 
a challenge still exists in terms of number of times households from the assessed 
districts consumed food particularly rich in nutrients that can be used to determine 
adequacy  of  nutrients.  Analysis  results  have  shown  that  the  Food  Consumption 
Score  Nutrition, 
an  indicator  that

and

(cereals, 
fruits,  vegetables 
and  diary)18  there 
is  limited  dietary 
diversity  hence  the  current  high  nutrition  challenges 
being faced in the country at large. Figure 22 has shown that most households in 
the  assessed  districts  consumed  frequently  food  groups  reach  in  vitamin  A  (70 
percent)  which  are  low  in  hem  iron.  Despite  this  imbalance  in  the  consumption 
patterns, the results have shown that there are households that consumed food rich 
in proteins and hem iron quite frequent (48 percent and 56 percent respectively). 
The proportion of households not consuming foods rich in proteins and hem iron 
is  a  bit  high  with  35  percent  not  consuming  at  all  hem  iron  rich  foods  and  21 
percent not consuming protein rich foods. 

 

The  attributing  factors  vary  ranging  from  costs  attached  to  accessing  the  protein 
and  hem  iron  rich  foods,  limited  nutrition  education  and  to  some  extent  social-
cultural  dimensions.  There  is  however  a  strong  correlation  between  these  two 
indicators  on  FCS  as  can  be  seen  in  Figure  22.  The  results  have  confirmed  that 
most households with increased consumption frequency of foods rich in  proteins 
and hem iron generally had better FCS mainly falling under categories Acceptable 
and  Borderline  respectively.  Furthermore,  the  picture  was  also  true  that 
households that did not consume at all food rich in proteins, hem iron and vitamin 
A  had  poor  FCS  and  accounts  for  the  majority  of  households  in  the  assessed 
districts.  This  scenario  remains  worrying  as  their  productivity  levels  will  be 
compromised  as  they  will  be  extremely  susceptible  to  ill  health  due  to  poor 
nutrition.

18 No-hem iron foods allow absorption of 1-5% of nutrients (cereals, fruits, vegetables and dairy products)

4.8. Coping Strategy Index (CSI) 

Coping  strategies  are  sets  of  response  options  people  would  apply  in  oder  to 
mitigate  effects  triggered  by  shocks.  This  ultimately  helps  them  have  desirable

The  results  have  shown

access  to  seasonal  foods 
owing to the late onset of 
rainfall  which  affected 
much of December, 2015 
and  part  of 
January, 
2016. The comparative analysis for 2016 and 2015 on the RCSI has shown that it 
remained fairly similar in the rural stratum of the assessed districts but increased 
by 32 percent from 23.5 to 31.1 in the urban stratum. 

this 

is 

 

 

This phenomenon is largely attributed to the high food commodity prices in most 
markets  which  is  the  main  source  of  food  for  households  in  the  urban  stratum. 
Further  the  analysis  has  shown  that  female  headed  households  employed  more 

 

58 

unsustainable consumption strategies compared to male headed where their RCSI 
has  been  found  to  be  23.6  with  that  of  male  headed  being  24.2.  The  trend  has 
remained  the  same  as  last  year’s  where  the  RCSI  for  female  headed  households 
was 24.0 compared to 22.9 for male headed households. 

The effects of poor start of the rain season on people’s livelihoods cannot be over 
emphasized  in  the  forty-two  (42)  assessed  districts.  In  view  of  this,  the  analysis 
has revealed that majority (55 percent) of the households did adopt some form of 
livelihood  coping  strategies  beyond  their  usual  routine  economic  activities.  Of 
these  55  percent  of  households  that  adopted  some  form  of  livelihood  coping 
strategies, 31.3 percent adopted crisis coping strategies (e.g. selling of productive 
assets  which  ultimately  reduces  their  human  capital  and  future  productivity)  and 
15.1 percent adopted stress coping strategies (e.g. borrowing money or consuming 
savings  to  deal  with  shocks).  Suffice  to  mention  that  there  were  households  (8.6 
percent) that adopted emergency coping strategies (e.g. selling of land, begging to 
meet food and income needs, illegal income activities such as prostitution).  

The  analysis  has  also  shown  that  most  households  from  the  rural  stratum  of  the 
assessed districts did adopted either stress, crisis or emergency livelihood coping 
strategies to deal with food security challenges triggered by El Nino visa –vis poor 
start of rainfall.  

Figure 25: Livelihood Coping Strategies by Locality 

About  32  percent  of 

the  households  adopted  crisis 
coping strategies while 15 percent 
adopted  stress  coping  strategies 
and  are all from  the rural  stratum 
of  the  assessed  districts.  Further, 
of  those  that  adopted  emergency 
coping  strategies,  9  percent  are 
from  the  rural  stratum  compared 
to  6  percent  from  urban  stratum 
(Refer to Figure 25). 

The  analysis  has  also  revealed  variances  in  the  extent  of  livelihood  coping 
strategies  across  the  gender  status  of  the  household  heads.  In  view  of  this,  the 
results  have  shown  that  within  the  households  that  adopted  stress  coping 
strategies,  48.4  percent  were  male  headed  compared  to  51.6  female  headed.  The 
trend  is  very  similar  with  the  households  that  adopted  crisis  coping  strategies 
where  48.8  percent  were  male  headed  compared  to  51.2  percent  from  female 
headed. Further, of the households that adopted emergency coping strategies, 49.5 
percent were male headed compared to 50.5 percent female headed. 

The assessment results have shown that adoption of any three forms of livelihood 
coping strategies across the employment status (either unemployed, Informal and 
formal) was marginally different (Refer to Figure 26).

4.9. Health 
The 2015/2016 in-depth assessment like that of the preceding years, assessed the common 
and  childhood  illnesses  reported  by  the  district  health  offices  and  the  households.  This 
assessment  also  looked  at  the  health  seeking  behavior  of  households.  This  year’s 
assessment added reproductive and maternal health care.  

Regarding  the  common  illnesses  reported  by  districts,  confirmed  Malaria  was  the  most 
prevalent  disease  in  the  districts  assessed  (41  percent)  in  the  first  quarter  of  2016.This 
comprised  of  malaria  in  children  between  0  and  59  months  (Children  Under  five  years) 
at18  percent,  malaria  in  pregnancy  at  12  percent  and  malaria  in  adolescent  aged  group 
between 10 – 19 years at 11 percent. In additional, unconfirmed Malaria accounted for 10 
percent of the diseases assessed. Other notable diseases that were reported by the district 
health  offices  included  diarrhea  blood  (10  percent),  diarrhea  non-blood  (9  percent)  and 
cough/ARI  (9  percent).  Diarrhea  (blood  and  non-blood)  were  a  concern  as  it  accounted 
for  19  percent  of  the  diseases  assessed.  Diarrhoea  is  a  sign  of  poor  hygiene  and  safe 
water.  The  assessment  also  reviewed  that  HIV/AIDS  contributed  to  5  percent  of  the 
diseases in the assessed districts (See figure 27 for details).

Fever/Malaria at 58.8 percent followed by cough (18.4 percent) and non-bloody diarrhea 
(10.1  percent).  Bloody  diarrhea  was  reported  by  1.9  percent  of  the  households.  The 
pattern of diseases reported by households is similar to the data reported by district health 
officials  (Figure  27  and  figure  28  respectively).  There  was  an  increase  in  households 
reporting  diarrhea  (both  bloody  and  non-bloody)  in  first  quarters  of  2016  (12  percent) 
compared to first quarter of 2015 (3.4 percent).  

Figure 28:Diseases reported by households in the first quarter of 2016 

 

 

 

Diseases reported by households in the two weeks preceding assessment  

The  assessment  reviewed  that  52.1  percent  of  the  households  reported  having  had  a 
household member sick in the last two weeks prior to the assessment.  During this period, 
Fever/Malaria  was  the  most  commonly  reported  ailment  (54.5  percent)  followed  by 
Cough  (20.1  percent)  and  Non-bloody  diarrhea  (7.3  percent).  Bloody  diarrhea  was  still 
reported by 1.7 percent of the households similar to the reported cases  in the entire first 
quarter  of  2016.  When  compared  to  the  2015  assessment,  Fever/Malaria  remains  the 
leading  cause  of  ailment  followed  by  Diarrhea.  The  disease  pattern  on  the  assessed 
ailments did not change significantly in the two weeks prior to the assessment and during 
the entire first quarter of 2016 as shown in figure 28 and figure 29.

Reproductive Health  

 

Reproductive  health  services  are  a  key  category  of  health  services  that  can  be  affected 
during adverse environmental conditions or related phenomena. The assessment reviewed 
that  there  was  an  increase  in  the  total  number  of  women  accessing  reproductive  health 
services in first quarter of 2015 compared to 2014 but there was a slight reduction in the 
total  number  of  women  accessing  the  same  reproductive  health  services  in  the  first 
quarter  of  2016  compared  to  2015.  This  reduction  was  observed  on  all  the  services 
assessed except for youth friendly services which showed significate increase by about 50 
percent  in  first  quarter  of  2016  compared  to  first  quarter  2014.  Delivery  by  health  care 
worker  was  the  most  affected  as  it  has  reduced  by  50  percent  from  2014  to  2016.  This 
finding  is  important  and  requires  further  inquiry  as  it  has  potential  to  increase  maternal 
mortality and morbidity. Reported cases of sexual violence   had increased 6 fold in first 
quarter of 2015 compared to first quarter of 2014 but the reported cases in first quart of 
2016  reduced  by  about  50  percent  of  the  2015  numbers.  Cases  of  anemia  also  showed 
significant  reduction  in  the  first  quarter  of  2016,  see  Table  8  and figure  30  for  details.   
There is need for further assessments to  better understand the reductions in the reported 
cases as this could be attributed to either reduced numbers of women reporting to health 
facilities or actual reduction in the incidences.

Health Care seeking behavior 

Figure  31  shows  that  most  of  the  household  members  (88.5  percent)  reported  to  have 
gone to seek care from formal care (Clinic, Hospital, or village health worker). Only 0.7 
percent  reported  having  gone  to  a  private  health  care  facility  and  a  similar  percentage 
having gone to traditional healer. It was found that 5.1 percent of the households reported 
that household members did not seek any health care whilst 3.3 percent reported having 
had taken their own medication purchased from “tuntemba”.

When  asked  about  the  reasons  for  not  going  to  seek  care  at  health  facilities  the  main 
reason given was lack of transport (29.1 percent) or transport money (14.2 percent) whilst 
18.1 percent indicated that they were on home based care. These findings are similar to 
the 2015 findings where lack of transport was the leading reason (38 percent), money was 
13  percent  and  home  based  care  was  given  as  a  reason  in  14  percent.  This  year’s 
assessment  added  two  questions  on  unavailability  of  medicines  which  was  given  as  a 
reason for not seeking care by 8.3 percent of households and lack of health care workers 
(HCW) which was give as reason by 2.4 percent of households.

Disease burden by water treatment 

Treatment  of  water  is  one  of  the  elements  to  the  reduction  of  the  burden  of  waterborne 
diseases. The assessment indicates that all identified forms of treatment had an effect on 
the  reduction  of  the  both  diarrhoea  blood  and  diarrhoea  non-blood.  For  example, 
respondents  who  treated  water  using  chlorine  reported  only  2.8  percent  diarrhoea  non-
blood and 1.0 percent diarrhoea blood. The assessment showed that malaria disease was

correlation.   

Disease burden by water source 

The analysis results showed that the unimproved water source had higher disease burden 
as compared with improved water sources. Diarrhea (blood) was the highest and posting 
up to 72.4 percent followed by cough that was at 70 percent. Reasons for these observed 
percentages could be attributed to the poor water that these sources are providing. 

Disease by type of Sanitation Facility 

The type of sanitation facility used by the household does to some extent contribute to the 
type  of  diseases  suffered  by  household.  The  assessment  shows  that  the  households  that 
suffered  from  almost  all  identified  diseases  were  those  using  traditional  pit  latrines 
(between 60 percent and 80 percent) as their main sanitation facility. This is as shown in 
Figure 33 below: 

 

Figure 33: Disease by Sanitation Facility 

 

 

The analysis results have further shown  that households that had members sick from all 
diseases  in  the  last  two  weeks  prior  to  the  assessment  had  unimproved  sanitation 
(traditional  latrine)  as  their  main  sanitary  disposal.  On  the  other  hand,  only  households 
with  improved  sanitation  such  as  flash  toilets  reported  cases  between  3  percent  and  12 
percent among all the recorded diseases. 
 
Immunization 
 
Diseases suffered by under five children 

Fever, ARI/cough, and  Diarrhea were the top three diseases that affected the under five 
children  during  the  period  under  review.  The  highest  prevalent  was  ARI/cough  with  29 
percent followed by fever and diarrhea with 27.2 percent and 10.1 percent respectively as 
shown in Figure 34 below.

In  the  first  quarter  of  2016,  malaria  was  high  among  children  (70  percent)  followed  by 
diarrhea  (23  percent)  as  opposed  to  the  same  period  in  2015  when  the  highest  was 
cough/ARI at (60 percent) followed by malaria (32 percent). 

Under Five Immunization 

Almost  all  the  parents  interviewed  indicated  that  they  had  their  children  immunized  as 
shown  in  the  Figure  35  below.  The  lowest  percentage  was  OPV  4  with  37.2  percent, 
however this is an increase from 9.3 percent showing that almost all children who missed 
the OPV 0 received OPV 4. Other antigens were above the national target of 80 percent.

4.10. Nutrition 
Evidence exist showing that during an emergency situation, food security, care practices 
and environmental factors especially at household level are compromised. These are seen 
in  times  of  famine,  wars  and  even  in  moderate  emergencies  such  as  the  prolonged  dry 
spells and floods as the current state for Zambia. Most emergencies have common feature 

 

66 

outcomes  such  as  disruption  of  the  agriculture  cycle,  displacement  of  farmers  from  the 
land as in times of floods or war, interference in the market systems, destruction of food 
stocks  and  harvests  leading  to  increased  food  prices  and  at  times  making  it  difficult  to 
reach  the  affected  individuals.19  It  further  leads  to  poor  living  environments  including 
poor water sources, sanitation and hygiene; increased common childhood diseases such as 
diarrhoea and pneumonia; and food crisis. The possible effect of the above factors which 
are  usually  linked  with  each  other  is  poor  nutrition  either  as  under  nutrition  or  over 
nutrition in the long run and disease in both children and adults.20  
 
Undernutrition  is  characterised  as  stunting,  underweight  or  wasting  in  children  and 
chronic energy deficient  in adults. Wasting results from acute significant food shortages 
and/or diseases and it may appear much earlier than stunting in  an emergency situation. 
Stunting occurs due to long term exposure to insufficient nutrient intake and frequency of 
disease  including  poor  child  care  practices21’22.  Underweight  is  a  composite  of  both 
stunting  and  wasting.  Onis  et  al  in  their  report  indicated  that  stunting,  underweight  and 
wasting of more than 20 percent, 10 percent and 5 percent respectively is of public health 
concern  while  stunting  of  more  than  40  percent  is  considered  severe  and  requires  quick 
response.  In  adults,  chronic  energy  deficiency  is  measured  using  Body  Mass  Index 
(BMI). Anything less than 18.5kg/m2 is a cause for concern. MUAC is also used to screen 
adults  in  emergencies.  A  Middle  upper  arm  circumference  (MUAC)  of  less  than  21cm 
signals poor nutrition. It is clear from literature that poor nourished women tend to have 
poorly nourished babies/children. Therefore, programmes to address malnutrition should 
cover both the children and women. 
 
Nutritional status by indices  
The  prevalence  of  malnutrition  for  the  current  ZVAC  depicts  a  situation  of  emergency 
category  in  children  (Table  9).  Stunting  was  49.5  percent  with  a  mean  z  score  of  -
2.23(SD  ±3.00)  while  underweight  was  14.7  percent  (z  -0.69,  SD  ±1.54).  Both  stunting 
and underweight were higher among boys than girls. The overall prevalence of wasting is 
7  percent  with  a  mean  z  score  of  0.81  (SD  ±2.20).  Unlike  stunting,  wasting  is  slightly 
higher  in  girls  than  boys.  It  was  alarming  that  severe  (30  percent)  stunting  and  wasting 
(4.8  percent)  were  higher  than  moderate  stunting  and  wasting.  Wasting  of  more  than  5 
percent  as  the  case  is  in  this  report  may  be  a  serious  contribution  to  morbidity  and 
mortality  that  is  reported  in  Zambia.  ZDHS  (CSO,  2014)  which  has  reported  childhood 
mortality of 75 deaths per 1,000 live births.  
 
Regarding age, stunting was common among children up to 53 months while wasting was 
higher in children below 18 months of age (Table 10). Evidence show that stunting for up 
to  about  34  months  means  that  children  could  be  suffering  from  growth  failure  and  are 
likely to recover if food security and disease situations are corrected while those over 34 
months may have fallen into the stunting status that is likely to be a permanent condition.

Nutritional Status by MUAC 
The MUAC measurement for children is used as a proxy for wasting and assesses the risk 
of  death  among  6  to  59  months  of  age.  Oedema  was  also  used  in  the  assessment  to 
determine the level of severe under nutrition among the children. The results showed that 
6.9 percent children were at risk of severe wasting, 3.2 percent were at risk of moderate 
wasting (Table 9).  The analysis showed that there were almost same proportion of girls 
and  boys  who  were  at  risk  of  severe  and  moderate  wasting.  Furthermore,  about  2.7 
percent of the children had Oedema across all the districts.  
 
The 2016 results of the child MUAC measurements showed that the malnutrition situation 
worsened when compared with the 2015 results. Severe acute malnutrition increased from 
2.2  percent  in  2015  to  7.0  percent  in  2016  while  moderate  malnutrition  remained 
approximately  at  the  same  level  of  3.2  percent.  Compared  to  last  year,  overall 
malnutrition  using  MUAC  increased  by  4.8  percent  point  (from  5.4  percent  in  2015  to 
10.2 percent in 2016).  The increase may be attributed to reduced food production due to 
poor  rains,  high  disease  levels  in  the  affected  areas  due  to  poor  water  sources  and 
sanitation.

In  emergencies,  MUAC  among  adults 
is  used  to  assess  the  nutritional  status 
and  to  determine  the  eligibility  for 
nutrition  support 
low  resource 
settings.  It  is  in  this  light  that  the 
MUAC  measurements  were  taken  for 
women  in  all  the  districts  assessed. 
Figure  36  shows  that  9.0  percent  of 
women  were  undernourished.  Of 
these,  1  percent  were 
severely 
undernourished.  
 

 
The  results  further  shows  that  majority  of  the  severely  wasted  women  were  found  in 
Mwandi  (16  percent)  and  Luampa  (11.8  percent)  districts  (Figure  37).  The  majority  of 
the  moderately  wasted  women  were  in  Sesheke  (9.5  percent)  and  Shang’ombo  (8.0 
percent).

There was not much difference in moderate nutrition using MUAC between the male (7.2 
percent) and female (7.7 percent) headed household.  However, there were more women 
with  severe  malnutrition  in  male  headed  households  (2  percent)  than  female  headed 
households (0.7 percent). 
 
Figure 38: Proportion of children under five years receiving Vitamin a Supplement 
and Deworming 

 

 

 
About 74 percent of the children in the survey areas received vitamin A supplementation 
while 62 percent were dewormed within months before the survey. 
 
 
The  findings  from  the  survey  showed  that  there  is  a  high  proportion  of  stunting  in 
children  under  five.  Equally  important  to  note  is  the  high  levels  of  wasting  (Weight  for 
Height).  Using  MUAC  measurements,  it  showed  that  there  was  an  increase  in  wasting 
over  a  period  of  2  years  (2015  and  2016  VAC  results).  Evidence  show  that  high  and 

70 

 

increasing undernutrition levels as the case was for this survey, poses a serious impact on 
morbidity and mortality on children under five.  
 
If  the  situation  is  not  corrected,  within  the  first  1000  days  of  child’s  life,  children  who 
survive beyond that period are at risk of permanent damage to health. In early years of a 
child’s life, especially the first two years of birth, growth and development  is at its peak 
and  yet  in  such  scenarios  it  is  interrupted  with  poor  nutrition  and  repeated  disease 
episodes leaving the child with little chance to reach its full potential. Effects of long term 
undernutrition  are  also  seen  in  terms  of  poor  school  performance  in  children  due  to 
delayed motor and cognitive development. These effects are largely irreversible. 
 
The  findings  also  show  lower  coverage  of  vitamin  A  supplementation  and  deworming 
than  the  expected  80  percent  threshold  that  would  bring  about  the  expected  impact. 
Adequate  vitamin  A  in  the  body  is  known  to  support  the  immune  system  and  thus 
improve  the body’s defence on diseases.  Further, deworming helps  to  get rid of the soil 
transmitted helminths that are known to rob the body of its blood resulting into anaemia. 
Low  coverage  such  as  observed  in  this  study  requires  to  be  addressed  to  improve  on 
morbidity especially of children. 
 
Maternal  undernutrition  exists  in  this  study  group  and  therefore  it  is  a  threat  to  child 
growth.  Evidence  show  that  poor  maternal  nutrition  leads  to  intra-uterine  growth 
retardation  and  low  birth  weight.  Therefore,  if  the  country  does  not  put  effective 
programmes to address undernutrition in women and children, and improve child feeding 
practices especially in the early stage of life, the children will continue with poor growth 
until permanent impairment after the second year of life. 
 
The  poor  nutrition  status  observed  in  the  affected  districts  may  have  emanated  from 
various elements of the social system. The study has also reported high levels of diseases 
such as coughing, diarrhoea and malaria which have increased over the two years’ period 
except  for  coughing.  Furthermore,  the  study  has  also  revealed  poor  water  sources  and 
sanitation  for  36  percent  of  the  population.  These  two  factors  are  very  much  linked  to 
disease and undernutrition. 
 
The  agriculture  sector  has  also  reported  worsening  food  security  as  compared  to  2015 
report. This situation increases the risk of poor dietary diversity in the household due to 
food insecurity. This has been illustrated further from the findings of the survey that only 
41 percent of the households had acceptable food consumption score (FCS). This means 
that  there  would  be  limited  intake  of  nutrient  dense  foods  that  can  provide  nutrients  for 
proper, growth, development and health maintenance. 
 
All  the factors highlighted above as risk factors  to  nutrition  are further illustrated in  the 
UNICEF  causality  conceptual  framework  as  either  immediate  or  underlying  causes  of 
undernutrition. Therefore, to address undernutrition, it requires concerted effort of many 
partners involved to ensure effective use of scarce resources. The interventions therefore 
should be carefully planned in such a way that they are delivered almost at the same time 
to the same household to have noticeable impact.

4.11. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene 

Main Water Sources 
The  assessment  revealed  that  household  access  to  total  improved  water  supply  by  main 
sources was at 55 percent of which 41 percent was borehole, 8 percent piped water and 6 
percent  protected  well.  The  household  access  to  unimproved  water  supply  was  at  45 
percent of which 25 percent was unprotected well, 18 percent river or lake and 2 percent 
for  other  unimproved  sources.  For  the  purpose  of  this  report,  improved  water  sources 
were  grouped  as  borehole,  piped  water  and  protected  wells  while  unimproved  water 
sources were grouped as unprotected wells, streams, rivers or lakes and other.

percent  and  28.1  percent,  respectively.  The  provinces  with  the  highest  improved  main

Sources of Water Affected by Prolonged Dry Spells 

The assessment also revealed that 51.7 percent of the households indicated that their main 
water  sources  were  affected  by  dry  spells.  Though  these  households  had  their  water 
sources  affected  by  the  dry  spells,  none  abandoned  their  primary  water  sources  as  they 
had not dry up yet. However, the households whose main source of water were affected 
by  dry  spells  had  alternative  or  secondary  sources  of  water  in  case  of  drying  out,  52.6 
percent  of  the  households  said  they  had  rivers  or  lakes  while  47.4  percent  of  the 
households had unprotected well as their secondary sources of water. 

Compared to the same period last year, the level of water at the main water sources had 
reduced for rivers and lakes (49.8 percent), unprotected wells (60.4 percent) and protected 

 

73 

wells  (66.8  percent).  Nevertheless,  compared  to  the  same  period  last  year,  the  level  of 
water at the main water sources had not changed for boreholes (60.8 percent), piped water 
(75 percent) and others (46 percent). But also compared to the same period last year, the 
level  of  water  at  the  main  water  sources  had  become  higher  to  some  extent  for  all  the 
main water sources (between 6 to 23 percent).

Distance to Water Source 

The assessment revealed that while only 10 percent have access to a water source within 
their  household  premises,  35  percent  of  the  respondents  had  access  to  a  water  source 
within 100m from their household, 41 percent had access to a water source between 100m 
and 500m from their household and 14 percent had access to a water source above 500m 
from  their  household  (Figure  43).  Compared  to  2015  assessments  results,  households 
with  water  access  within  their  premises  below  100m  from  household  have  increased 
while  households  who  had  access  to  a  water  source  between  100m  -  500m  and  above 
500m  from  their  household  have  decreased.  The  reduction  in  the  distance  to  the  water 
sources reflect the successes by government and its partners in the last year by drilling a 
number of boreholes in the quest to reduce distance to within 500m for all Zambians.

Perceived Water Quality of Drinking Water 

The assessment revealed that the water quality from the households’ main water sources 
were percieved as either good or poor. The proportion of households whose water quality 
was percieved  good was 65.6 percent. (Figure 44). 

Figure 44: Perceived Water Quality of Main Sources Of Water 

 

 

The different reasons percieved by the households for poor water quality, included taste, 
ordor, suspended particles, colour and other polutants (Figure 45). Suspended particles in 
water  was  found  to  be  the  most  reason  for  the  perceived  poor  water  quality  at  52.8 
percent, followed by water colour at 31.2 percent).

The  assessment  revealed  that  the  highest  reason  for  percieved  Water  Quality 
Contamination for the rivers and lakes, unprotected well, protected well and Piped water 
is the presence of Suspended Particles at 65.6 percent, 57.5 percent, 53.5 percent and 43.6 
percent,  respecively.  The  second  highest  reason  for  percieved  Water  Quality 
Contamination for the rivers and lakes, unprotected well and protected well is the water 
colour  at  19.1  percent,  30.1  percent,34.2  percent  and  26.5  percent,  respecively.  For  the 
boreholes, the highest reason for percieved Water Quality Contamination is water color at 
52.1  percent  followed  by  presence  of  Suspended  Particles  27.3  percent.  For  the  “other 

 

76 

water  sources”,  the  highest  reason  for  percieved  Water  Quality  Contamination  is  the 
presence of suspended particles at 57.9 percent followed by odour at 21.7 percent.  
 

Water Treatment and Treatment Options Applied by Households 

The assessment revealed that only 23.8 percent of the households treated their water. Out 
of  those  that  treated  water,  60.6  percent  use  chlorine,  followed  by  29.1  percent  of  the 
households  who  boil  their  water.  Another  5.7  percent  treated  their  water  using  ash  or 
other  methods,  with  a  nominal  2.7  percent  each  using  filtration  and  2  percent  use 
decanting for their water treatment (Figure 47 below). The last year’s figures also show 
that the people who do not  treat  their water has remained very high.  Lack of a country-
wide sustained water treatment campaign by government and its partners is one reason for 
this  phenomenon.  MOH  and  MLGH  need  to  promote  water  quality  monitoring  and 
control;  and  do  a  nation-wide  community  campaigns  for  household  water  treatment  and 
safe storage. UNICEF and other donors need to support nation-wide capacity building for 
sustained promotion.

Sanitation Facilities 

Distribution of Sanitation Facilities 
Traditional  latrines  were  found  to  be  commonly  used  by  households  (67.4  percent), 
followed  by  Sanplat  or  improved  traditional  latrine  (3.5  percent);  flash  toilet  (2.7 
percent); VIP latrines at 2.2 percent. The results have also shown that a larger proportion 
of  households  had  no  sanitation  facilities  at  all  and  opted  to  use  open  defecation 
(24.1percent).

Sanitation Facilities Distribution by Asset Wealth Index 
The  study  revealed  that  when  sanitation  facilities  are  distributed  among  the  three  asset 
wealth  indices,  access  to  traditional  latrines  was  the  highest  among  each  of  the  wealth 
indices:  61.4  percent  for  the  Asset  Poor,  72.5  percent  for  the  Asset  Medium  and  80.2 
percent  for  the  Asset  Rich.  The  study  revealed  that  access  to  traditional  latrines  was 
followed  by  no  sanitation  facilities  or  open  defecation  among  all  the  three  asset  wealth 
indices:  35.1  percent  for  the  Asset  Poor,  20  percent  for  the  Asset  Medium  and  10.1 
percent for the Asset Rich. The asset poor households are 3 times more likely to have no 
sanitation facility or use open defecation than the asset rich households.

In  the  rural  areas,  the  most  common  sanitation  facility  was  the  traditional  latrine  (69.2 
percent) followed by no facility or open defecation (24.8 percent). In the urban areas the 
most common sanitation facility was also the traditional latrine at 60.8 percent followed 
by the flash toilet at 22.9 percent (Figure 50 below). 
 

Figure 50: Type of Sanitation Facilities by Region 

 

 
All  the  five  provinces  had  traditional  latrines  as  the  most  prevalent  with  the  least  being 
54.3  percent  coverage.  The  largest  number  of  traditional  latrines  were  found  in  Eastern 
with 93 percent, Central with 91.5 percent; Lusaka with 72.6 percent, Southern with 69.1 
percent and the least being western with  54.3 percent. The provincial distribution of the 
sanitation  facilities  indicates  that  open  defecation  was  highest  in  Western  province  with 
42.3  percent,  followed  by  Lusaka  ate  17.1  percent,  Southern  province  at  15  percent, 
Central at 4.3 percent and least being Eastern at 1.1 percent.

Hygiene Practices 

Scouring agents used for hand washing  
The  study  revealed  that  regarding  hand  washing  after  use  of  the  toilet,  53.5  percent 
indicated using soap to wash their hands. There results have also shown that a substantial 
proportion  of  households  in  the  assessed  districts  used  nothing  but  water  to  wash  their 
hands (40.8 percent) and the rest used other means to wash their hands. 
 
Figure 52:Use of scouring agents for Hand wash 

 

Handwashing practices before cooking and after using the toilet 
The study revealed that out of the households that responded, 79.5 percent washed their 
hands before preparing food and 20.5 percent did not. After using the toilet, 80.1 percent 
of  households  washed  their  hands  and  19.9  percent  did  not  wash  their  hands.  The 
assessment revealed that most households indicated that they forgot to wash their hands 
(refer to Figure 53)

4.12. Education 
The  discussion  on  education  component  of  this  assessment  has  focused  mainly  on  school 
attendance  of  school  going  children  to  be  able  to  deduce  extent  to  which  prolonged  dry  spells 
either directly or indirectly caused it. In that regard, the assessment results have shown that 66.7 
percent  of  the  households  in  assessed  districts  indicated  having  a  school  going  child  and/or 
children. Further, the results have also shown that those households that indicated having a child 
or two that are school going, only a small proportion (13 percent) had their children absent from 
school between December, 2015 and April, 2016. The numbers of children absent, however was 
not that much and ranged from 1 and 2 representing 12.9 percent of households that indicated the 
sex of children being  absent as male and 11.2 percent of households that indicated   girls being 
absent. 

There  are  various  reasons  which  were  revealed  that  led  to  the  absenteeism  of  the  school  going 
children  in  the  assessed  districts  with  the  main  one  having  been  helping  with  household  chores 
(35.2 percent), followed by hunger in the households (24.3 percent), caring for the sick household 
member (13.2 percent) and absence of teachers from school (8.7 percent). 

The analysis has revealed that female headed households (51.4 percent) accounted for the largest 
proportion  of  children  who  were  absent from  school between  December,  2015 and  April,  2016. 
Despite the proportion of absenteeism among school going children in some districts being low, 
the possibility of this trend increasing is there if appropriate interventions are not put in place to 
reduce  the  withdrawal  of  children  to  handle  household  chores  which  include  looking  for  food 
during hunger peaks and caring for the sick at the expense of school. 

4.13. Developmental Projects and Safety Net Projects 
 
Development  projects  and  safety  nets  programmes  are  critical  for  reducing  poverty  and 
stimulating local economies. This in turn helps households to better manage risks and  
cope with shocks in the district where they are done.

Figure  54.  The  others  were  National  NGO,  UN  Agencies,  Faith  Based  Organisations, 
District  Authorities  and  national  NGOs,  while  some  communities  indicated  that  there 
were no developmental projects (13.7 percent) running in their communities. Those being 
implemented included mainly farming input support (Seed and Fertilizer), food stuffs and 
capacity building among others.

CHAPTER FIVE: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

5.1   Early Warning 
Conclusions 

•  Despite  the  increase  in  the  number  communities  receiving  early  warning 
messages,  there  is  need  to  strengthen  the  nationally  managed  systems  and 
packaging to facilitate wider utilization by different community stakeholders. 

Recommendations 

•  ZMD  together  with  key  stakeholders  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture, 
Community Development and Social Welfare and DMMU should generate timely 
and 
public 
stakeholder/communities in accessing early warning messages on time

5.2. Agriculture and Food Security 
 
Conclusions 
 

•  Livelihood diversification has continued to be low for most households with crop 

production being the main livelihood and trading as the second most. 

•  Over dependency on crop farming especially maize is  risky considering the high 
sensitive  to  climate  changes  as  was  the  case  when  prolonged  dry  spells  affected 
the first part of 2015/16 rainfall season due to a strong El Nino; 
 

•  Households  did  not  utilize  all  the  available  land  for  cultivation  due  to  drought 

conditions and limited access to agricultural inputs. 

•  The promotion of maize production at the expense of other crops has made maize 
the  most  cultivated  crop  in  almost  all  these  areas.  However,  during  the  2015/16 
production  season  there  was  an  increase  in  production  of  sorghum,  rice,  millets 
and cassava. This  could  be partly attributed to the inclusion of rice and sorghum 
seed  in  the  Farmer  Input  Support  Programme  (FISP).  The  production  of  maize 
even in the marginal areas of south western and extreme southern Zambia where 
conditions are not favourable for good growth exposes farmers to poor yields and 
consequently impact food security. 

•  Overall  maize  production  was  negatively  impacted  by  the  dry  spells  and 
production  reduced  in  comparison  to  previous  season.  Other  reasons  limiting 
production for the 2015/2016 season was lack of inputs; fertilizer, improved seed, 
inadequate  labour  and  lack  of  draught  power.  Southern  province  recorded  the 
highest  decline  in  production.  The  main  reason  for  not  acquiring  inputs  was  the 
high cost of fertilizers and seed in addition to not benefiting from the FISP. 

•  Out  of  a  total  maize  production,  407,049  MT  will  be  retained  by  households. 
Household  own  produced  stocks  for  93  percent  of  the  households  will  last  for  6 
months only compared to 23 percent in a good year and by November (start of the 

83 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lean  period)  nearly  all  households  will  have  run  out  of  own  produced  stocks 
compared to 56 percent in a good year. 

•  Households  with  financial  capabilities  will  resort  to  markets  when  own  staple 
foods  run  out.  While  41  percent  of  the  communities  indicated  that  staple  food 
would  be  readily  available  at  local  markets  in  the  next  six  months  the  rest  will 
have difficulties accessing staple food markets. The major limitation is distance to 
markets. 

•  While  markets  play  a  major  role  in  household  food  access,  the  above  five-year 
average maize and maize meal prices will limit market access for poor households 
without sustainable incomes.  Households will have to resort to markets and other 
sources of food and/or coping strategies for the rest of the consumption season. 
 

•  Generally, all households in the assessed districts indicated having some form of 
storage  facilities  within  their  homesteads,  though  majority  are  not  that  climate 
sensitive to ensure their produce are safe guarded and/or last longer with minimal 
damage. 
 

•  The  most  common  foods  majority  of  the  households  preserved  for  future 

consumption included vegetables, cereals mainly maize and tubers. 

• 

Inadequate  pasture  and  water  availability  will  impact  negatively  on  livestock 
production  and  productivity.  As  a  result,  livestock  will  have  to  be  moved  or 
migrate long distances to access pasture and water mainly along major rivers and 
lakes.  The  large  flock  of  animals  in  these  areas  may  increase  the  probability  of 
livestock contracting diseases.  

•  Livestock  disease  incidences  continue  to  be  the  major  cause  of  livestock  deaths 
and  the  prolonged  dry  spells  experienced  in  the  previous  season  impacted 
negatively  on  pasture  and  water  availability  which  may  have  contributed  to 
disease outbreaks such as New castle for chicken.    

•  Fish catches have reduced, compared to the same time last year due to low water 
levels in water bodies (rivers, lakes, dams and ponds). Although the reduction in 
fish  catches  has  been  gradual  over  the  years  (due  to  bad  fishing  methods),  the 
negative effects of the poor rains for the past two seasons could have aggravated 
the  situation.  Affected  households  will  have  reduced  incomes  and  reduced  fish 
consumption.  

 
Recommendations 
 
Food requirements: 
 
Short Term 

•  A  total  of  975,738  people  (162,623  severely  and  moderately  affected  households)  from  the 
assessed  districts  will  require  support  for  the  period  of  eight  (8)  months  (August,  2016  – 
March, 2017) in thirty one (31) districts broken down as follows: 

 

84 

 

o  For  the  period  August  to  December,  2016,  support  will  only  target  257,592  people 
(42,932 households) severely affected with food supplies constituting cereals (10,729 
MT),  pulses  (1,288  MT)  and  oil  (644  MT)  totaling  12,661  MT  in  twenty-six  (26) 
districts; 

o  From  January  to  March,  2017,  support  will  be  provided  through  the  Social  Cash 
Transfer (SCT) for the ZVAC caseload of 975,738 People (162,623 households for a 
period of three (3) months in thirty-one (31) districts. 

o  As this is the first time support is being provided through the current SCT, not all the 
affected  households  may  be  absorbed.  The  ZVAC  caseload  of  975,738  People 
(162,623 households) that may not be absorbed will be assisted for a period of three 
(3)  months  starting  January  to  March  2017,  with  relief  food  support  constituting 
cereals (24,384 MT), pulses (2,927 MT) and oil (1,464 MT) totaling 28,775 MT. 

•  Provision  of  emergency  input  support  to  households  (13,699)  whose  incomes 
from agriculture livelihoods were adversely affected by dry spells and will not be 
able  to  procure  through  markets  and/or  benefit  from  existing  input  support 
programmes.  

 

Medium Term 

•  Support for increased food crop productivity at household level so as to enable them 

to have adequate own produced food and cash crops through: 

o 

 Mechanization  for  farmers  to  put  more  land  under  cultivation.  This  can  be 
done  through  provision  of  loans  for  farm  implements  such  as  the  ZNFU 
mechanization programme. 

o  Support  timely  land  management  for  improved  productivity  using  the  same 

pieces of land.   

o  Increased  access  to  fertilizers  and  improved  seeds  through  diversified  input 
packs  such  as  E-voucher  that  provides  for  farmers  to  access  inputs  of  their 
choice. 

o  Provision of emergency inputs to households whose incomes from agriculture 
livelihoods  were  adversely  affected  by  dry  spells  and  will  not  be  able  to 
procure

Long Term 
• 

Improving access to markets by: 

o  Investing in improvement of road infrastructure specifically feeder roads.  
o  Open up rural areas through improved services for ease of doing business and 

thus increase establishment of small businesses in outlying areas. 
 

Improving  storage  facilities  at  homestead  level  to  ensure  food  materials  last  longer, 
help  optimize  farmer’s  gains  and  help  in  preserving  the  nutrition  quality  of  foods. 
This  can  ride  on  existing  Post  Harvest  Loss  initiatives  and./or  projects  that  are

5.3. Health 
Conclusion 

•  There  is  generally  an  increase  in  the  number  of  households  reporting  having  a 
member or more that suffered from  malaria and  diarrhea in  the first  quarter of 2016 
compared to the same period in 2015. 

o 

 Malaria was highest in Luano and Chirundu (Valley districts) districts while 
diarrhea disease was high in every district 

• 

 There was an improvement in health seeking behavior with majority going to formal 
health  facilities  though  a  small  proportion  opted  not  to  seek  for  formal  care  due  to 
lack of money. 

•  The assessment has shown that despite the disease patterns not changing significantly 
between  2015  and  2016,  Malaria,  Diarrhoea  and  respiratory  tract  infections  are  still 
the leading causes of illness in the assessed communities. Changes in weather patterns 
have  potential  to  increase  risks  associated  with  these  conditions.  Particularly  low 
water levels  that is  associated with  the El Nino phenomena has potential to  increase 
the  incidence  of  diarrhoea  diseases.  There  is  need  to  enhance  WASHE  programs  in 
affected communities.  

•  Heat  stress  has  also  been  associated  with  increased  incidences  of  respiratory  tract 
infections hence the need for increased surveillance in the affected communities. The 
country has observed reduced malaria incidences in the past few years though malaria 
still remains among the top 10 causes of ill health.  

•  The addition of reproductive health aspects in this assessment opens another window 
of opportunity to assess the impact of adverse weather patterns on reproductive health 
services.  In  the  Zambian  setting,  women  play  a  key  role  in  the  wellbeing  of  their 
families  and  changes  in  social  economic  situation  and  weather  patterns  such  as  that 
brought about by the El Nino phenomenon could lead to women failing to attend their 
routine  health  care  services  such  as  scheduled  antenatal  care,  post-natal  care,  and 
family planning services. 

 
•  The reduced number of women visiting health facilities for family planning, antenatal, 
postnatal, and delivery services in  the first  quarter 2016 needs further  attention with 

86 

 

increased awareness raising through community agents and other means. Since there 
are no fees for primary health care services including reproductive health services in 
the  public  health  sector  the  reduced  numbers  of  women  accessing  these  services  in 
2016  compared  to  2015  cannot  be  attributed  to  lack  of  money  but  to  other  factors. 
Further  assessments  need  to  be  done  on  this  aspect  to  come  up  with  targeted 
interventions. What is of particular note is the significant reduction in cases of sexual 
violence reported in 2016 compared to 2015. Further, investigations need to be done 
to establish the real reason for the reduced numbers of sexual violence cases.  

It is encouraging to note that majority of households are seeking health care from the 
formal health systems. This is an opportunity to ensure information sharing regarding 
behavioural  change  for  aspects  such  as  malaria  prevention,  prevention  of  diarrhoea, 
antenatal  and  postnatal  clinic  attendance,  and  the  importance  of  delivering  at  health 
facilities by skilled attendants regardless of the social economic situation.  

 
• 

 
•  These interventions include use of community agents such as safe motherhood action 
groups,  use  of  maternity  waiting  homes  for  women  who  come  from  long  distances. 
This  also  applies  to  women  who  have  identified  risks  and  require  to  deliver  in 
facilities with highly skilled staff and specialised equipment. Delivery of reproductive 
health  services  through  outreach  to  communities  is  critical  in  such  communities 
especially that the main reasons given for not going to seek care from health facilities 
was lack of transport or lack of transport money. 
 

Recommendations 

Short term 

•  Enhanced programs to address malaria to include social and environmental 

determinants to ensure targeted interventions. This will include the following: 

o  Community sensitizations on prevention of malaria.  
o  Increase the coverage of indoor-residual spraying districts. 
o  Supporting communities to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds. 
o  Increased  distribution  of  insecticide  treated  mosquito  nets  in  the  affected 

areas. 

o  Sensitisation on increased use of insecticide treated nets. 

•  Enhanced  campaigns 

to  encourage  women’s  utilisation  of  maternal  and 
reproductive  health  services  from  health  facilities.  This  could  also  include 
increased  coverage  with  integrated  outreach  services  for  maternal  and  other 
reproductive health services such as family planning.   

• 

Integrating  reproductive  health  services  with  other  primary  health  care  services 
such  as  HIV,  Malaria  preventions,  etc.  This  can  be  done  both  through  static  or 
integrated  mobile  outreach  service  delivery  and  through  other  communication 
engagement approaches.  

•  Since  only  selected  diseases  were  assessed,  there  is  need  to  have  further 
assessments of a broader spectrum of health services across the affected areas to 
understand the impact of prolonged dry spell on overall health care delivery. This 
could  involve  surveys  or  desk  review  of  the  health  management  information 
systems data.  

87 

 

Medium to Long term  

•  Enhance malaria and diarrhoea surveillance at community level. 
•  Need  for  sustained  commodity  supply  for  treatment  of  all  infections  especially 

malaria, diarrhea diseases, and reproductive health services. 

•  There  need  for  a  multi-sectoral  and  multi-disciplinary  approach  to  enhance  the 
health  response.  This  includes  incorporating  messages  on  better  health  seeking 
behaviours  into  other  interventions  such  as  nutrition,  agriculture  input  support, 
etc. 

•  Carry  out  a  detailed  financial  and  programmatic  gap  analysis  of  the  health  care 
delivery  system  in  the  affected  areas  to  help  in  designing  of  medium  and  long 
term interventions to mitigate the impact of prolonged dry spells on health.   

•  Creation or enhancement of a multidisciplinary response team  to  design  a health 
surveillance  and  response  plan  for  current  and  future  adverse  weather  and  other 
related events.  

5.4. Nutrition 
 
Conclusion 
 
•  The  findings  from  the  survey  showed  that  there  is  a  high  proportion  of  stunting  in 
children  under  five.  Equally  important  to  note  is  the  high  levels  of  wasting  (Weight 
for  Height).  Using  MUAC  measurements,  it  showed  that  there  was  an  increase  in 
wasting  over  a  period  of  2  years  (2015  and  2016  VAC  results).  Evidence  show  that 
high  and  increasing  undernutrition  levels  as  the  case  was  for  this  survey,  poses  a 
serious impact on morbidity and mortality on children under five. 

 
•  All  the  factors  that  have  been  discussed  as  risk  factors  to  nutrition  are  further 
illustrated  in  the  UNICEF  causality  conceptual  framework  as  either  immediate  or 
underlying causes of undernutrition.  

 
 
 
Recommendations 
 
Short term measures 

• 

Integration of nutrition in health-promotion strategies especially those addressing 
maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy and lactation, these should include 
interventions that address adolescent nutrition. 

•  Scaling  up  coverage  and  rolling  out  of  stunting-prevention  interventions  in 

emergency areas. These may include: 

o  Infant and young child interventions. 
o  Increased  micronutrient  intakes  especially  during  the  1,000  most  critical 

days.  

o  Interventions for addressing severe acute malnutrition.  
 
Promotion of consumption of healthy, diversified diets, including high quality 
nutrient rich foods for both men and women. 
 

 

88 

Long term measures 

•  Promotion of livelihood diversification to include crops beyond maize, fisheries 
and animal products for vulnerable but viable households to address poverty. 
 

5.5. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene 
Conclusions for WASH 

•  Generally,  households  reported  that  their  main  water  sources  got  affected  by 

prolonged dry spell. 

•  Some  water  sources  were  perceived  to  be  contaminated  but  majority  of 

households in the surveyed districts did not treat their drinking water. 
 

 
Recommendations for WASH 

Short – term (Water) 

•  Continue  to  drill  boreholes  in  areas  where  water  sources  are  unimproved,  where 
the water levels reduced and where the distance from household to water point is 
more than 500m. 

•  Continuous  monitoring  of  the  situation  in  the  affected  districts  in  case  of  water 

points drying out and determining alternative water sources.   

•  Rehabilitation,  improvements  and  maintenance  of  existing  water  infrastructure 

that are affected by dry spells. 

Short – term (Sanitation) 

•  Promote community wide sanitation improvement using CLTS as part of the ODF 

Zambia 2020.  

•  Promote a community wide handwashing campaign as part of the implementation 
of the ODF Zambia 2020 program to increase the practice of proper handwashing. 
•  Promoting CLTS monitoring and maintaining ODF status, clean environment, and 
partnering  with  traditional  leaders,  local  religious  leaders  and  the  influence  and 
opportunities  they  have  in  bringing  messages  of  personal  cleanliness  and  well-
being to their community.  
•  Promote  private  sector 

to  support 
communities  and  households  to  build  robust  and  appropriate  latrines  versions 
from the start (taking the transformation agenda, Vision 2030 for Zambia and the 
ODF Zambia 2020). 

involvement 

in  sanitation  marketing 

•  Promote and construct  demonstration latrines at  the schools, health centres, rural 

community centres (markets, faith centers, and traditional chiefs’ palaces). 

 

Medium and long term (Water) 

•  Promote and ensure community involvement in planning, designing and 

construction of multi-purpose water infrastructure (e.g., small dams and ancillary 
works) and in watershed management. 

 

89 

•  Rehabilitation, improvements and maintenance of existing water supply 

infrastructure. 

•  Plan for and implement with support of NGOs the water harvesting program at 

community and household levels for climate change adaptation. 

•  Promote community level modern energy adoption, water supply and sanitation 

technology options, disaster risk reduction and resilience building including 
climate change adaptation activities, to ensure preparedness, resilience and 
mitigation of disasters. 

Medium and long term (Sanitation) 

•  Provide external technical advice in challenging geographical environments while 

ensuring full consultation with beneficiaries regarding technical challenges and 
solutions.  

•  Promote “Smart” subsidies targeted to particularly vulnerable groups (including 

cash for the ODF Zambia 2020 transfers)or to households facing significant 
technical and physical challenges to latrine building (including mason/ artisan 
technical support).  

•  Promote public-private partnerships or private involvement to build sanitation 
shops at District/Chiefdom level to sell sanitation facilities and give advice on 
improved sanitation facility construction, and latrine operation and maintenance.
