Executive Summary 

 

The  beginning of the 2008/9 rainy season  was described  by the Zambia Meteorological 

Department  (ZMD)  as  normal  with  the  rains  having  started  early  in  most  parts  of  the 

country apart from the extreme eastern parts of the country (Lundazi, Chama and Isoka). 

However,  as  the  season  progressed  there  was  widespread  increased  rainfall  intensity  in 

December and January while rains in the southern half the country eased off in February 

resulting  in  prolonged  dry  spell  in  the  extreme  south.  The  month  of  March  was 

characterised by wide spread heavy rains culminating into flash floods especially in low 

lying areas of the country (i.e. valleys). This had varied degree of negative impact on key 

sectors of the economy. 

 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  Zambia  Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee  (ZVAC) 

undertook a Multi-Sectoral In-Depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment in twenty (20) 

districts  in order to determine the  impact of the 2008/9  floods on various  sectors of the 

economy.  The  districts  visited  were  Kapiri  Mposhi,  Serenje,  Mambwe,  Kawambwa, 

Mpika,  Mungwi,  Mporokoso,  Chavuma,  Zambezi,  Kabompo,  Kasempa,  Mufumbwe, 

Mwinilunga, Lukulu, Kaoma, Mongu, Kalabo, Shang’ombo, Senanga and Sesheke. 

The assessment employed the qualitative and quantitative approaches in the collection of 

the  data.  Under  the  quantitative  approach,  structured  household  questionnaires  were 

employed  in  280  Standard  Enumeration  Areas  (SEAs)  targeting  a  total  of  2,  800 

households  in  twenty  (20)  districts.  Under  the  qualitative  approach,  community 

interviews  were  conducted  in  all  the  280  SEAs.  In  each  of  the  sampled  SEA, 

anthropometric data collection methods were used to collect nutrition data for the under-

five children.

Major Findings 

•  The post floods survey conducted  in twenty (20) districts established that a total 

of  499  359  people  (83,  227  households)  were  negatively  impacted  upon  by  the 

2008/9  flood  situation.  It  should  be  emphasized  that  this  figure  represents  the 

number  of  people  and  households  affected  overally  and  does  not  in  any  way 

represent any sector based population.   

•  The major income sources for most of the households were cash crop production, 

casual labour, petty trading and fishing, in order of importance. It was found that 

there  were  no  major  differences  in  income  sources  of  the  sampled  households 

between the 2007/08 and the 2008/09 season. This  implies that no  major  impact 

was exerted on these sources by floods. 

•  The  production  of  cereals,  mainly  maize,  had  risen  in  all  the  assessed  districts. 

Increase in production of the staple from the previous season ranged between 4% 

for Mwinilunga and Kabompo to 39% for Lukulu. 

•  Although maize prices have started falling as small scale maize becomes available 

on the market from the new harvest, maize grain prices have remained generally 

high.  Breakfast meal prices were still rising in the month of May while the price 

of roller meal marginally dropped. 

•  The prevalence of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) was found to be 1.4% out of 

which  0.3%  had  bilateral  oedema.  Global  Acute  Malnutrition  (GAM  stood  at 

3.6%. These results show no significant differences from the expected situation in 

the country. 

•  Based on the above scenario, it was established that a total of 110, 651 people (18, 

442 households) in seven (7) districts were found to be food insecure. 

•  The  survey  found  that  69.2%  of  the  under  five  children  had  suffered  from 

Fever/suspected malaria, diarrhoea (watery stool), Cough, or skin infection while 

30.8% did not suffer from any illness. 

•  The  assessment  established  that  immunization  coverage  was  high  in  all  the 

assessed districts. The measles coverage of 86.5 % was recorded among children 

aged  between  6-59  months,  93.7%  was  recorded  for  OPV  and  94.1%  for  DPT

immunization  while  the  BCG  coverage  was  found  to  be  at  97.2%.  The  health 

Card (76.9%) and verbal history provided by the caregiver (22.2%) were the main 

source of information for child immunization. 

•  For water and sanitation, the assessment established that 50% of the communities 

drew  water  from  unprotected  water  sources  such  as  lakes,  rivers,  unprotected 

wells and unprotected springs. 

•  Of the sampled households, 24% indicated that they treated their drinking water. 

The  most  commonly  used  method  for  water  treatment  was  found  to  be  use  of 

chlorine (19%) and boiling (5%). There were very  few  households who resorted 

to filtration as a water treatment method.  

•  The assessment revealed that 45% of the sampled households indicated that water 

sources were within 100 to 500 meters while 32% of the households indicated that 

water sources were located at a distance less than 100 meters. 

•  The  assessment  revealed  that  the  main  sanitary  facilities  used  by  the  sampled 

households were traditional latrine (67.8%). 

• 

In the last 6 months, 97% of respondents indicated that they did not have any boys 

and girls that dropped out of school. 

•  The highest form of violence was early marriage (3.9%) and this was followed by 

other  types  ranked  as  follows:  assault  (3.4%),  child  defilement  (1.0%),  rape 

(0.9%)  and  other  types  of  violence  (0.9%)  and  sexual  exploitation  (0.2%).  The 

highest proportion (5.7%) of child defilements occurred in households headed by 

the 16 to 19 years age group and the next highest proportion was in the age range 

of 40 to 59 years (0.9%). 

•  The survey revealed that of the total number of households that were affected by 

floods,  only  10%  were  displaced.  This  translates  into  a  total  of  280  households 

displaced (1,680 people).  The displacement of the households was mainly due to 

the weak housing structures which are built with pole, mud and grass. 

•  The  infrastructure  sector  was  the  worst  hit  sector  by  the  2008/9  floods.  Roads, 

bridges and culverts were washed away by the flood waters. School infrastructure 

also suffered major damage.

Conclusions  

 

Infrastructure 

A total of 327 structures were damaged or washed away. This includes roads, bridges 

and  culverts  in  different  districts  of  the  country.  The  school  infrastructure  has  been 

covered under education. 

 

Agriculture and Food Security 

The production of the staple in all the twenty districts had increased with the increase 

ranging from 4% to 39%. However, owing to the fact that most of these districts have 

had floods the past three seasons, it is likely that this marginal increase would afford 

the community enough resilience in terms of food security. 

 

Cattle  prices  in  the  assessed  districts  either  rose  or  remained  stable  with  respect  to 

prices  which  prevailed  in  December  2008.  The  fact  that  cattle  prices  in  areas  with 

relatively  low  December  prices  (lean  season  prices)  increased  in  May  shows  that  at 

the time of the assessment, farmers were still able to negotiate for higher prices and 

therefore not desperate to sale.  

The  price  increases  over  the  previous  season  were  high  for  most  areas  with  the 

highest  reported  in  Kaoma  (100%),  while  Lukulu,  Senanga,  Kalabo,  Mwinilunga, 

Shang’ombo  and  Mongu  reported  at  least  50%  increase  in  price.  This  can  be 

attributed  to  the  fact  that  2008/09  marketing  season  was  a  maize  deficit  year  when 

most areas experienced low maize supply towards the end of the season which pushed 

prices  up  significantly.  Therefore  May  2009  prices  still  remained  high  as  the  new 

harvest had not yet adequately reached the market. 

Of  the  twenty  (20)  districts  visited,  7  districts  were  found  to  have  most  households 

which had experienced drastic reduction in their harvest of the main staple. A total of 

110, 651 people (18,442 households) were found to be food insecure and will require 

some  assistance.  Four  districts  namely  Kapiri  Mposhi,  Kasempa,  Mambwe  and

Mongu were likely to face food insecurity as the analysis showed that the situation in 

the districts could go either way. 

Nutrition 

The 2009 in-depth vulnerability assessment revealed that vitamin A supplementation 

and de-worming program among children (6 – 59 months) was as low as 61.6% and 

17.2 %. These coverage results, on vitamin A supplementation and de-worming, are 

lower compared to other community surveys that have been conducted before. 

It  was  also  observed  that  the  supplementation  and  therapeutic  feeding  programs 

coverages were  low (2.0 and 1.4% respectively).  The  number of children who were 

reported  to  have  been  on  therapeutic  feeing  program  at  the  point  of  survey  was  14 

(1.0%). 

The  in-depth  assessment  revealed  that  the  prevalence  of  Severe  Acute  Malnutrition 

(SAM) was 1.4%. The proportion of children with bilateral oedema was 0.3%. Global 

Acute  Malnutrition  (GAM)  was  3.6%.  Underweight  rate  among  under-five  children 

was 15.2%, of which about 5% were severe. Stunting was the most prevalent form of 

malnutrition  in  the  flood  affected  areas.  The  levels  of  malnutrition  (wasting)  in  the 

flood  affected  areas  were  normal,  while  the  levels  of  underweight  were  slightly 

higher.      

Water and Sanitation 

The  assessment  revealed  that  most of  the  unprotected  water  sources  such  as  spring, 

well and rivers were highly prone to contamination of faecal matter due to flooding. 

About  36%  of  the  sampled  households  whose  main  water  source  was  unprotected 

wells indicated having a household member suffering from diarrhoea. The assessment 

further revealed that 22% of the households whose main water source was river/lake 

and 19% of the households whose main water source was borehole indicated having a 

household  member  suffering  from  diarrhoea.    Despite  the  unsafe  water  sources  that 

the sampled households used, 74% of them indicated that the water quality was good.

Health 

The  survey  found  that  69.2%  of  the  under  five  children  had  suffered  from 

fever/suspected  malaria,  diarrhoea  (watery  stool),  cough,  or  skin  infection  while 

30.8% did not suffer from any illness. The assessment established that immunization 

coverage was high in all the assessed districts. The measles coverage of 86.5 % was 

recorded  among  children  aged  between  6-59  months,  93.7%  was  recorded  for  OPV 

and 94.1% for DPT immunization while the BCG coverage was found to be at 97.2%. 

A small percentage of the eligible children did not receive vaccines while 0.9% of the 

child  caretakers  did  not  know  whether  the  child  had  been  immunized  or  not. 

Shang’ombo was the only district that reported severe damage on the health  facility 

while  Kabompo,  Kasempa  and  Lukulu  had  their  facilities  moderately  affected. 

Kawambwa,  Mufumbwe,  Mwinilunga,  Zambezi,  Mongu,  Senanga  and  Sesheke 

reported  minor  damages  on  the  health  facilities.  However,  there  was  no  impact  of 

floods  on  health  infrastructure  in  Kapiri  Mposhi,  Serenje,  Mambwe,  Mporokoso, 

Mungwi, Chavuma and Kalabo districts.   

Education 

The  assessment  indicated  that the  floods  did  not have  remarkable  impact on  school 

drop out. It was established that the reasons why 2.6% of children dropped out were 

due  to  the  fact  that  the  family  could  not  afford  school  fees.  The  other  reasons  for 

school drop – out were because of pregnancy on the part of girls and ill health. The 

assessment also established that schools in the assessed districts had suffered damage 

due to the heavy rainfall. 

Social Protection 

The  assessment  showed  that  there  were  protection  issues  in  the  assessed  districts 

although the cases were very low. The most common cases in order of ranking were; 

early  marriages  (35%),  assault  (25%),  sexual  exploitation  (14%),  rape  (11%),  child 

defilement (9%) and other types of violence (1%). In most of the instances the main 

perpetrators of  these  cases  were  relatives/neighbours  and  other  people  (94%),  while 

development workers constituted 4% of the perpetrators.

Human Habitation and Shelter 
 
The floods displaced total of 280 households (1, 680 people) with the Western 
Province being the worst affected. All the displaced communities were actually in the 
rural areas.

1.0. INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 

Background  

 

The  beginning of the 2008/9 rainy season  was described  by the Zambia Meteorological 

Department  (ZMD)  as  normal  with  the  rains  having  started  early  in  most  parts  of  the 

country apart from the extreme eastern parts of the country (Lundazi, Chama and Isoka). 

However,  as  the  season  progressed  there  was  widespread  increased  rainfall  intensity  in 

December and January while rains in the southern half the country eased off in February 

resulting  in  prolonged  dry  spell  in  the  extreme  south.  The  month  of  March  was 

characterised by wide spread heavy rains culminating into flash floods especially in low 

lying areas of the country (i.e. valleys). This had varied degree of negative impact on key 

sectors of the economy. 

 

 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  Zambia  Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee  (ZVAC) 

undertook a Multi-Sectoral In-Depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment in twenty (20) 

districts. The provinces and districts where the assessments were conducted included the 

following: 

•  Central Province – Kapiri-Mposhi and Serenje 

•  Eastern Province – Mambwe 

•  Luapula Province – Kawambwa 

•  Northern Province – Mpika, Mungwi and Mporokoso 

•  North-Western Province – Chavuma, Zambezi, Kabompo, Kasempa, Mufumbwe,       

Mwinilunga 

•  Western Province - Lukulu, Kaoma, Mongu, Kalabo, Shang’ombo, Senanga and 

Sesheke 

The report, therefore, presents the major findings of the 2009 In-depth Vulnerability and 

Needs  Assessment  conducted  to  determine  the  extent  and  effects  of  the  floods  and/or 

water logging on agriculture and food security, infrastructure, health and nutrition, water 

and sanitation and habitation and human shelter.

1.2.  Objectives 

1.2.1.   Overall Objective 

The  assessment  was  aimed  at  determining  the  extent  and  effects  of  the  2008/9  floods 

and/or water logging on various sectors of the economy.  

1.2.2.   Specific Objectives 

  To determine the full extent to which floods and/or water logging impacted on: 

•  Crops and livestock 

•  Livelihoods of affected communities 

•  Water and Sanitation 

•  Education 

•  Human Settlement and Shelter 

•  Markets 

• 

Infrastructure 

•  Health and Nutrition status of under-five children 

  To determine the areas as well as the population affected 

  To  determine  extent  of  violence  against  women  and  children  in  flood  affected 

areas. 

  To determine the food and non-food needs in the affected areas, if any. 

 
1.3.     Scope of the In-Depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment. 
 
The  floods  experienced  in  the  2008/9  rainfall  season  had  adverse  effects  in  Central, 

Eastern,  Luapula,  Northern,  North  Western  and  Western  Provinces  where  20  districts 

were  directly  affected.  The  sectors  impacted  upon  by  the  floods  included  health  and 

nutrition, water and sanitation, education, infrastructure, habitations and agriculture.   

The assessment was designed  in such a way that data collection was conducted at three 

(3) levels of the district. The entry level for the teams collecting the In-Depth Assessment 

data  was  at  the  district  level  through  the  District  Disaster  Management  Committees 

(DDMCs)  where  meetings  were  held.  The  next  level  was  the  community  where 

 

 
 
 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

2 

community  leaders  were  interviewed  through  focused  group  discussions  (FGDs).  The 

main variables/parameters collected during the FGDs included the following: 

•  Rainfall pattern and its effects 

•  Food security programmes 

•  Livelihoods sources 

•  Food crop and livestock production and availability 

•  Health and nutrition related variables 

•  Water contamination  

•  Sanitation

1.4.  Methods and Procedures 
 
1.4.1.   Sampling Frame 
Zambia  is  administratively  divided  into  nine  provinces.  Each  province  is  in  turn 

subdivided into districts. Each district is further subdivided into constituencies and wards. 

For statistical purposes each ward  is subdivided  into Census Supervisory  Areas (CSAs) 

and  these  are  in  turn  subdivided  into  Standard  Enumeration  Areas  (SEAs).  The  1998-

2000  mapping  exercise  in  preparation  for  the  2000  census  of  population  and  housing, 

demarcated  the  CSAs  within  wards,  wards  within  constituencies  and  constituencies 

within districts. In total, Zambia has 72 districts, 150 constituencies, 1,289 wards. Wards 

are further divided into CSAs, which are in turn divided into Standard Enumeration Areas 

(SEAs). The SEAs are also stratified  by urban  and rural  strata. The  listing of SEAs  has 

information on number of  households and the population. However, for the purposes of 

this  survey,  SEAs  constituted  the  ultimate  Primary  Sampling  Units  (PSUs).  Therefore, 

the sample frame for this survey is the list of SEAs developed from the 2000 Population 

Census.  

1.4.2. Sample Stratification and allocation  

In  order to  have  district  level  estimates,  as  well  as  equal  precision  in  the  estimates,  the 

Equal Sampling Allocation Method (ESAM) was adopted. Within each district, 14 SEAs 

were selected. These consisted of 7 SEAs in the flood-affected areas and 7 SEAs in the 

 

 
 
 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

3 

areas  not  affected  by  floods.  The  allocation  of  sample  points  within  each  district  was 

done  proportional  to  their  size.  The  measure  of  size  in  the  SEAs  was  based  on  their 

respective populations as reported in the 2000 Census of Population.  

 

1.4.3. Sample Selection 

The  In-Depth  Vulnerability  and  Needs  Assessment  survey  employed  a  two-stage 

stratified cluster sample design. In the first stage, 14 SEAs were selected across the two 

strata (flood- and non-flood affected) from each of the 20 targeted districts, while in the 

second stage, households were randomly selected from the selected SEAs.   

 

1.4.4. First Stage Selection  

At  the  first  sampling  stage,  the  sampled  SEAs  were  selected  within  each  district 

identified  to  have  received  above  normal  rainfall  systematically  with  probability  to 

estimated  size  (PPES)  from  the  ordered  list  of  SEAs  in  the  In-Depth  Vulnerability 

sampling  frame.  The  measure  of  size  for  each  SEA  was  based  on  the  population  size 

identified  in  the  2000  Census.  The  frame  of  SEAs  within  each  district  was  sorted  by 

urban/rural  variable  which  provided  further  implicit  stratification.  The  following  first 

stage sample selection procedures were used:  

 

 

(1)  Sort the  SEAs  within  each  district  by  the  following  codes:  region  (rural/urban), 

constituency, ward, CSA and SEA. 

(2) Cumulate the measures of size (population) down the ordered list of SEAs within 

District.  The  final  cumulated  measure  of  size  will  be  the  total  population  in  the 

frame for the strata or district (Mds). 

(3) To obtain the sampling interval for district or stratum ds (Ids), divide Mds by the 

total number of SEAs to be selected in district ds (nds): 

 

Ids= Mds/nds  

The  Excel  software  was  used  for  selecting  the  sample  of  the  280  sample  SEAs  for  the 

survey following these procedures, based on the allocation of the sample SEAs, described

Sample Stratification and allocation section above. Separate excel files per province were 

used  showing  the  ordered  frame  of  SEAs  with  the  corresponding  2000  Zambia  Census 

information. It documents the  first stage systematic selection of sample SEAs with PPS 

for each district stratum within the province for the selected districts.  The selected areas 

were  arranged  in  a  separate  excel  file  used  to  calculate  the  weights  for  each  selected 

HHLD in a district stratum.  

 

1.4.5. Second Stage Selection 

The second stage of the sampling procedure involved the selection of households in the 

SEAs  selected  at the  first  stage.  Due to time  and  resource  limitations,  listing  to  get the 

updated number of households was not done. For the purposes of this survey the measure 

of  size  (NSEA)  for  the  PSUs  was  assumed  to  be  that  in  the  Census  2000  frame.  In  each 

SEA  10  households  (nSEA)  were  selected.  The  sampling  interval  k  was  calculated  as 

follows: 

 

 

k= (NSEA)/ (nSEA). 

Every  k-th  household  in  the  selected  area  was  canvassed  until  all  the  required  10 

households were covered. 

 

1.4.6. Weighting Procedure 

In order for the sample estimates  from  any particular survey to be representative of the 

population,  it  was  necessary  to  multiply  the  data  by  a  sampling  weight,  or  expansion 

factor.  In  other  words  a  sample  of  households  that  were  selected  using  a  known 

probability, it was necessary to make inference to the population where the sample came 

from.  The  raw  data  was  multiplied  by  a  factor  which  represented  the  actual  population 

estimates. The  basic weight  for each  sampled  household was equal to the  inverse of  its 

probability  of  selection  (calculated  by  multiplying  the  probabilities  at  each  sampling 

stage).

Based on the sample design for the Survey, the probability of selection within each SEA 

was different for the households depending on which strata it was sampled from i.e. flood 

or non flood (e.g. dry spell areas). The probability of selection for sample households in 

each stratum within a selected district was generalized as follows:   

pdsi

pdsi = probability of selection for the sample households within the i-th sample 

SEA in district or stratum ds 

mds= number of sampled SEAs selected in district ds. 

Ndsi  =  total  number  of  households  in  the  frame  for  the  i-th  sample  SEA  in 

district ds. 

Nds = total number of households in the frame for district ds. 

ndsi  =  number  of  sample  households  selected  in  a  district  s  from  the  given 

number of households (2000 census) for the i-th sample SEA in district h 

 

The two terms in pdsi correspond to the first and second stage probabilities of selection; at 

the first stage the SEAs were selected with probability proportional to size of population 

(PPS),  and  at  the  second  stage  the  households  were  selected  with  estimated  equal 

probability within each SEA. 

 

The  basic  sampling  weight  was  equal  to  the  inverse  of  the  probability  of  selection. 

Therefore the corresponding basic weight for the sampled households in each district was 

calculated as follows:

1.4.7. Estimates for Nutrition Component 

 

1.4.7.1. Sample size and sampling process for the household survey 

In the calculation for the minimum number of children required for the whole survey for 

key  nutrition  indicators,  it  was  found  that  1,300  children  would  be  required  to  get 

estimates at 95% confidence level in the entire survey (20 districts) that is the minimum 

number. Based on the national and NGO nutrition surveys, assumptions were made that 

each  household  would  have  an  average  of  one  child  aged  6  to  59  months,  a  household 

size  of  six  members  and  one  mother.  Prevalence  estimates  were  based  on  previous 

surveys carried out by Government departments in charge of nutrition and other UN and 

NGO agencies national wide. Due to the two-stage sampling technique that was used, it 

was  necessary  to  increase  the  sample  size  by  a  factor  that  would  allow  for  any  loss  in 

precision  due  to  departure  from  simple  random  sampling.  This  was  estimated  using  the 

Rapid Nutrition Survey of 2005 and the targeted nutrition assessment conducted in 2006 

by GRZ, UNICEF and WFP. The 2, 797 households covered in the In-Depth study were 

more than adequate to meet the minimum sample size. The number of children that were 

successfully measured in the study was 1, 198.  

 

1.4.7.2 Anthropometric measurement 

Survey workers measured children’s weight, height/length, and assessed the presence of 

bilateral oedema. Children were weighed to the nearest 100 grams using a digital SECA 

scale.  For  children  younger  than  2  years  of  age  or  less  than  85  centimetres  (cm)  long, 

length was measured to the nearest millimetre in the recumbent position using a standard 

height board. Children 85 to 110 cm were measured in a standing position. Oedema was 

assessed  by  applying  thumb  pressure  to  the  feet  for  approximately  3  seconds  and  then 

examining for the presence of a shallow print or pit.

1.4.8.  Analytical Approach 

 

1.4.8.1. Estimating Food Production in Maize Equivalent 

To estimate the production of main staples produced by the sampled households in maize 

equivalent for the 2008/09-production season, each of the produced cereals and/or tubers 

was converted into maize kilo calorie equivalent as a common unit. Maize was used as a 

common unit because of the staple being widely consumed in most parts of the country. 

To obtain  the  total  produced  quantities  of  maize  equivalent,  each  of  the  crops  was  first 

converted maize kilo calorie equivalent using formula below;

The calorie contents of various crop commodities were obtained from FAO (1997). The 

total  maize  equivalent  produced  was  therefore  a  summation  of  all  the  produced  staple 

crops by the sampled households as well as staples from other alternative sources such as 

carry over stocks, remittances and purchases. 

1.4.8.2. Identifying Desperate Areas and Persons 

Using  the  2007/08  household  production  data  as  a  base  for  determining  the  production 

gap,  the  production  estimates  for  2008/09  for  all  the  visited  districts  were  reviewed  by 

comparing 2007/08 and 2008/09 production. All districts that had percentage increase of 

10% or less were flagged as potential hotspot areas. The assumption is that households in 

these  districts  did  not  recover  substantially  from  the  adverse  impacts  of  the  2007/08 

floods. Furthermore, the little positive change in production recorded during the 2008/09 

season will not be enough to stretch these affected households to the next harvest due to 

their  already  eroded  livelihood  base  such  as  unsustainable  consumption  strategies  (over 

reliance on less expensive foods that are not nutritious , high percentage expenditure on 

food items. The other consideration is that these household’s improved livelihoods during 

the 2008/09 season, will start to fade away as the peak lean period is reached. 

 

 
 
 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

9 

The following formula was used to determine the production gap which was further used 

to select the hot spot districts: 

 

The  number  of  the  affected  persons  in  need  of  the  food  support  was  derived  through  a 

proportional  pilling  method  and  validated  by  the  percentage  of  households  affected  as 

depicted  in  the  Rapid  Assessment  in  May  2009.  Asset  ownership  amongst  the  sampled 

households  was  also  taken  into  consideration  in  determining  the  ability  for  the  affected 

households in cushioning the food gap. This was going to be through potential disposal of 

their assets without necessarily eroding their livelihoods further.  

The  districts  that  had  a  percentage  increase  of  between  10%  and  15%  were  flagged  as 

those  requiring  monitoring.  The  other  attributes  used  for  the  hotspots  also  applied  to 

those districts determined to be on monitoring. 

1.4.8.3. Determination of cereal requirements for the affected population in food    

insecure District 

The assessment used the following formula to determine the amount of cereal required by 

those affected: 

 

MAIZE REQUIREMENT1 = STANDARD RATION2 X # OF MONTHS3 X # AFFECTED PEOPLE  

                                                                                         1000 

 

 

Where, 

i. 

Total maize requirements in Metric Tonnes (MT) refers to total quantity of maize 

required in the affected district 

ii. 

Standard ration = 250grammes per person per day 

iii.  Number of months = duration of the food assistance 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

10 

1.4.8.4. Nutrition Cut-off points for children 

The  cut  –  off  point  for  the  anthropometric  measurements  taken  by  children  were  as 

follows: 

Moderate malnutrition< -2 W/H Z-scores and >-3 Z-scores 

Severe malnutrition:  <- 3 W/H Z-scores and/or presence of bilateral pitting (oedema) of 

the feet. 

 

 

The  prevalence  of  malnutrition  in  children  below  <-2  and  <-3  Z-scores,  and  the 

confidence  intervals  were  worked on  to  indicate  the  precision  of  the  estimate  obtained. 

The age and sex distribution of the population was analysed to see whether there was any 

abnormality. A high prevalence of malnutrition in children above 36 months is usually an 

indicator of acute food insecurity.     

 

1.5 

Limitations 

The limitations faced by the survey included the following: 

• 

 Information on water quality was qualitative based on aesthetic characteristics as the 

actual  scientific  tests  of  water  could  not  be  done  within  the  framework  of  the 

assessment. 

•  The small sample size for nutrition does not permit making generalisations at district 

level. 

•  The  teams  had  to  rely  on  air  transport  due  to  inaccessibility  of  some  of  the  flood 

affected districts. This caused some delay for the teams to access the particular SEAs 

that were inaccessible. 

•  The data did not make any comparison between primary and secondary schools. The 

emphasis was only on drop out. It could have been interesting to show whether there 

was resilience for secondary school children compared to primary school.

2.0. CONTEXT 

 
2.1. The Economy  

After registering continued growth as measured by the real gross domestic product (real 

GDP) in the last few years, economic growth in Zambia slowed down in 2008. This was 

attributed to unprecedented global and domestic events. The economy only grew by 5.8% 

in 2008 marking an 8% reduction in growth compared to the 6.3% achieved in 2007. The 

economic  performance  was  largely  driven  by  growth  in  transport,  communication, 

mining  and  manufacturing  sectors.  The  poor  performance  in  the  agricultural  sector  as 

well  as  the  slowdown  in  the  construction  sector  significantly  contributed  to  the  lower 

than expected growth. Despite the mining sector recording a welcome 4.9% growth, the 

sharp  decline  in  world  copper  prices  due  to  the  global  economic  downturn  has  had 

serious effects on mining operations which has in some cases resulted into mine closures 

and  loss  of  jobs.  Although  the  Government  policy  under  the  FNDP  of  achieving  and 

sustaining a single digit inflation was attained in both 2006 (8.2%) and 2007 (8.9%), the 

year end inflation rate rose to 16.6% in 2008. This was 86% above the 2008 end of year 

inflation and 137% above the target of 7%. The failure to sustain single digit inflation has 

been  mostly attributed to the effects of the high  international oil prices and  food prices. 

The food inflation particularly rose significantly from 5.9% at the end of 2007 to 20.5% 

at the end of 2008. The global financial crisis also negatively affected the exchange rate 

resulting  in  sharp depreciation of the  local  currency (Kwacha) against the US dollar  by 

27.3% between December 2007 and December 2008.    

 

With regard to the monetary and financial development, there was general slowdown of 

external  sector  performance  coupled  with  lower  than  expected  build  up  of  international 

reserves.  This  was  the  resultant  of  the  impact  of  the  global  economic  crisis  as  export 

receipts slowed down while imports significantly increased. As a result of the inflationary 

environment which prevailed in part of 2008, the interest rates which had been gradually 

falling  in  the  past  few  years,  increased  in  2008.  The  commercial  bank  lending  rates 

increased  in  line  with  increases  observed  in  government  securities  discouraging 

borrowing.  This  impediment  to  borrowing  has  kept  private  sector  investment  in

agriculture  very  low.  The  low  investment  in  agricultural  equipment  and  early 

warning/preparedness systems has left the sector highly vulnerable to climatic change. 

 

The  growth  in  the  agriculture  sector  contracted  by  4%  in  2008  compared  to  a  2.7% 

decline in 2007. The poor performance has been largely attributed to six factors namely; 

high  cost  of  inputs;  limited  access  to  credit,  extension  services  and  inputs;  inadequate 

infrastructure; poor livestock management; fertilizer support programme weaknesses and 

inadequate  private  sector  investment  in  the  sector.  The  2007/08  production  season  was 

characterized  by  adverse  rainfall  in  the  southern  parts  of  the  country  reducing  maize 

production by 11% compared to the 2006/07 season, and resulting  in reduced stocks on 

the market which kept maize prices at an abnormally high level towards the end of 2008. 

With  the  large  production  from  the  2008/09  season,  adequate  national  stocks  are 

available to meet  national demand keeping the  local  market well  supplied and ensuring 

reduced  staple  food  prices  for  consumers.  Continued  support  to  small  scale  farmers 

through programmes such as the fertilizer support programme, food security pack and out 

grower  schemes  should  to  a  certain  extent  help  sustain  high  production  particularly  for 

food  crops.  Government  is  concerned  that  the  input  support  programme  has  had  only 

limited  impact  on  agricultural  productivity  and  therefore  intends  to  comprehensively 

review the programme in order to increase its efficiency and effectiveness. As agriculture 

has  remained  a  key  sector  in  economic  growth,  Government  intends  to  continue 

supporting increased agricultural production with focus on improved extension services, 

increased  funding to rural  infrastructure and  livestock development as well as  increased 

support to livestock disease control and irrigation projects.   

 

2.2.  Agriculture and Food Security 

 

2.2.1.  Input Distribution 

The  various  Input  Distribution  Programmes  which  commenced  by  the  2002/2003 

agricultural season have in the last few years been aiming at increasing small scale farmer 

access to inputs for increased productivity. Unfortunately, over these years, most farmers 

remained  substantially  dependent  on  inputs  distributed  by  the  Government  and  Non

Governmental  Organisations without graduating  into self sustaining  farmers. The  major 

input  programmes  have  been  GRZ  Fertilizer  Support  Programme  (FSP),  PAM’s  Food 

Security  Pack  (FSP)  and  the  FAO  input  programme.  All  these  programmes  were 

necessitated by the need to facilitate farmers’ recovery from previous droughts.

The  most  consistent  among  the  three  has  been  the  Fertilizer  Support  Programme  (FSP) 

which has been funded annually.  

 

Although  input  support  to  small  scale  farmers  increased  in  2006/07  season  in  terms  of 

both  the  number  of  beneficiaries  as  well  as  quantities  of  inputs  distributed,  there  was 

general down sizing  in the 2007/08 season. This  was attributed to the  increased cost of 

fertilizer and Government’s  inability to  increase the  funding towards this program after 

fertilizer  prices  increased.  Fertilizer  support  dropped  substantially  by  42  percent  in 

2007/08 compared to the 2006/07 season. At the same time, the number of beneficiaries 

reduced by 50 percent.  

 

In  the  2008/09  season  which  was  characterized  by  substantial  increase  in  input  prices, 

particularly  fertilizer  (100%  increase),  government  increased  funding  to the  programme 

to cushion the small scale farmers from the escalating prices.  Government increased the 

subsidy  from  60%  to  75%  while  targeting  200,000  beneficiaries  with  80,000MT  of 

 

 
 
 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

14 

fertilizer  and  4,000MT  of  maize  seed.  This  level  of  support  was  a  significant  increase 

over the previous season.   

Support  for  the  Food  Security  Pack,  a  program  initiated  to  assist  vulnerable  but  viable 

farmers  with  seed  (cereal  and  legume)  and  fertilizer  in  2001  has  been  substantially 

reduced over the  years. During the 2008/09 production  season, only 5,804 beneficiaries 

were  targeted,  marking  a  310%  reduction  from  the  23,844  target  in  2007/08  season.  In 

line  with  the  reduced  beneficiaries, the  fertilizer  and  seed  distributed  dropped  by  116% 

and 119% respectively from 967MT and 175MT in 2007/08 season to 447MT and 80MT 

in 2008/09 season.   

 

Input  support  for  wetland  production  which  helps  farmers  practicing  recession  farming 

fill  the  food  gap  during  the  lean  period  (November  to  February),  has  also  significantly 

dropped in the last few years. Although the EU and DFID continued to provide support to 

wetland  production  through  FAO  (North  western  and  Western  Provinces)  and  PAM 

(Central, Northern and Luapula Provinces) up until 2007/08 season, that support was not 

forthcoming during the 2008/09 season.  

  

Through  the  input  support  programmes,  Government  expectations  of  significantly 

increased  agricultural  productivity  have  not  been  fully  met.  It  is  with  this  back  ground 

that  Government  is  initiating  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  input  support  programme 

aimed at increasing efficiency and effectiveness.  

 

2.2.2.  Crop Production, Food Supply and Access 

The  2008/09  production  season  crop  estimates  released  by  MACO  established  that 

production  of  major  crops  has  generally  increased  compared  to the  2007/08  production 

season (Figures 1 and 2).  Among the 18 monitored crops, only cotton, Virginia tobacco, 

and  mixed  beans  registered  production  decreases,  while  production  increased  for  the 

remainder of monitored crops.  Overall, crop production increased ranging from 25-147 

percent  compared  to  the  2007/08  production  season,  signifying  a  welcome  recovery  of 

production levels.   

 

 
 
 

 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

15 

Among  major  crops  produced,  maize  and  cassava  continue  to  rank  high  in  terms  of 

production  volume.  The  production  levels  of  other  crops  have  remained  significantly 

lower compared to last season. Maize production increased by 31 percent with respect to 

the  2007/08  season,  moving  from  1,445,655  MT  to  1,888,773  MT  (Figure  2).  Cassava 

production on the other hand remained relatively stable.   

 

 Production of small grains also increased over last season.  Wheat, whose production has 

doubled in the last 10 years, is expected to register a 72 percent production increase over

commodity 

has 

generally 

grown, 

 

almost  to  a  point  of 

meeting 

national 

demand,  which  is  estimated  at  200,000  MT.    However,  a  substantial  amount  of  local 

wheat  (65,000-70,000  MT)  from  the  2007/08  production  season  remains  unsold  seven 

months  after harvesting, and was carried over  into the 2009/10  marketing  season.  This 

carryover, which resulted from low demand for local wheat due to private sector imports 

of  cheaper  wheat  flour  from  South  Africa,  may  discourage  production  this  season,  and 

the 195,000 MT production estimate may not be attained.  Farmers are currently lobbying 

the Government of Zambia (GRZ) to establish policies that favour purchases from local 

wheat producers.

Although  at  national  level,  Zambia  has  attained  above  normal  maize  production,  data 

from  the  Crop  Forecast  Survey  shows  that  there  are  some  localized  areas  mostly  in 

western  Zambia  whose  production  was  reduced  due  to  the  impact  of  the  excessive 

rainfall.  

 

2.2.3.  National Food Supply for the 2008/09 Marketing Season 

 

Based  on  data  from  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  at  the  national  level,  Zambia  has 

produced  adequate  maize  to  meet  the  country’s  consumption  requirements  for  the 

2009/10  marketing  season.  This  implies  that  no  maize  imports  will  be  required  for 

commercial or relief purposes. 

 

The  total  maize  supply  is  estimated  to  exceed  domestic  requirement  by  203,271  MT 

(Table  1),  a  surplus  which  could  be  made  available  for  export.    In  the  case  of  wheat, 

increased  local  production  in  the  last  few  years  is  bringing  production  levels  closer  to 

those  needed  to  meet  national  demand.  However,  an  unusually  large  wheat  carryover 

from  the  2008  production  season,  resulting  from  imports  of  cheaper  wheat  flour,  may 

 

 
 
 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

17 

lead  to  reduced  production  of  the  crop  in  2009.    Similar  to  past  years,  sorghum,  millet 

and cassava production are adequately available to meet domestic requirements this year 

(Figure 2). An estimated 12,000MT of rice will  be required to meet the shortfall  in  line 

with previous years.

There is significant increase in maize availability  with respect to the 2008/09 marketing 

season as compared to last season.  As a result, Government is considering lifting of the 

maize export ban which was maintained throughout the 2008/09 marketing season due to 

the  maize  deficit  on  the  market  and  consequently  abnormally  high  maize  prices. 

Government  intends  to  initially  allow  maize  exports  up  to  100,000MT,  while  periodic 

reviews of the maize stock position during the current marketing season will determine if 

more  imports will  be allowed  later  in the season. In view of the  increased  local supply, 

informal exports to neighbouring DRC are expected to significantly rise above levels that 

prevailed during the previous marketing season.  

Although  at  national  level,  the  food  supply  situation  is  good,  there  are  potential  food 

problem  areas  in  some  localized  parts  of  the  country  particularly  the  western  Zambia 

where excessive rainfall caused flooding and waterlogging.

With adequate maize in the country, redistribution from surplus areas to deficit areas will 

be key in ensuring that maize prices do not remain at the high levels which prevailed in 

the 2008/09 marketing season. This also implies that any maize relief needs, in response 

to  the  adverse  impact  of  the  excessive  rainfall  in  localized  areas  during  the  2008/09 

agricultural season, can be purchased in-country. 

 

2.2.4. 

Food Access 

 

Maize  prices  which  were  abnormally  high  (Significantly  above  normal)  during  the 

second half of the 2008/09 marketing season though still high, have started falling as the 

new harvest reaches the market (figure 3). During the 2008/09 marketing season, maize 

and meal prices reached record high levels which compelled the Government to intervene 

in  the  market through  subsidizing  maize  sales  to millers  in  order to reduce  maize  meal 

prices.  This  intervention  led  to  the  temporal  reduction  of  maize  meal  in  January  and 

February. However maize meal prices rose again thereafter as the maize shortage on the 

market persisted limiting Government supply of subsidized maize to millers and creating 

meal shortage in localized areas consequently pushing prices up.

Although  maize  prices  have 

started  falling  as  small  scale 

maize becomes available on the 

market  from  the  new  harvest, 

maize 

grain 

prices 

have 

remained 

generally 

high.  

Breakfast  meal  prices  were  still 

rising  in  the  month  of  May 

while  the  price  of  roller  meal 

marginally  dropped.  The  fall  in 

the  roller  meal  prices  is  largely 

driven  by  the  low  demand  for 

the product as other seasonal  foods have  become  readily available reducing pressure on 

roller meal.

The  Food  Reserve  Agency  (FRA)  announced  its  intention  to  purchase  110,000  MT  of 

maize  from  remote  areas  of  the  country  this  marketing  season  at  a  price  of  ZMK 

65,000/50  kg  (about  USD  250/MT).    In  view  of  the  increased  levels  of  production  this

season, the amount of maize to be purchased is 38 percent higher than last season.  The 

FRA  purchase  price  also  increased  by  44  percent  with  respect  to  the  initial  2008/09 

marketing  season  price,  and  is  18  percent  above  the  August  2008  revised  price.    The 

increased indicative price was necessitated by the rise in production costs, as input prices, 

especially that of fertilizer, increased from last production season.  The Zambia National 

Farmers  Union  is  lobbying  the  GRZ  to  increase  the  minimum  price  of  maize  by  an 

additional 13 percent, using the significant increase in production costs as justification for 

the increase.   

 

With the  large output of  maize, the  market  is  likely to become a buyer’s  market, which 

may reduce the ability of small scale farmers to negotiate for prices above the FRA price.  

In  fact,  in  most  cases,  small  scale  farmers  are  likely  to  sell  at  prices  below  the  ZMK 

65,000 floor price, as maize floods the market and farmers become desperate to dispose 

of their maize due to inadequate storage and immediate need for cash.  These farmers will 

be  forced  to  sell  large  volumes  in  order  to  earn  adequate  money  for  other  necessities.  

They will, later in the season, have to depend on the market, and, at that point, will face 

higher  prices  and  difficulties  meeting  their  food  needs.  The  lifting  of  the  maize  export 

ban may help maintain relatively high prices for farmers storing the maize to sell later in 

the season. 

 

2.2.5. Livestock Situation  
 
Livestock production continues to be major livelihood activity among small scale farmers 

in  the  country.  According  to  statistics  obtained  from  MACO,  production  of  major 

livestock  is  concentrated  in  the  three  provinces  of  Central,  Southern  and  Western 

Provinces with cattle contributing at  least 55% share of  major  livestock in Zambia. The 

other  major  livestock  include  goats  (35%)  and  pigs  (10%).  Cattle  population  was 

estimated at 2,790,965 at the end of 2006 representing a 16.1%  increase  from the 2004 

estimate. Poultry continues to play a major role as a source of income and food with most 

household rearing it.  

 

 
 
 

 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

21 

In  the  past  number  of  years,  cattle  production  has  severely  been  disrupted  by  recurring 

disease outbreaks, the common ones being Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), East Coast 

Fever,  Contagious  Bovine  Pleuropneumonia  (CBPP)  and  New  Castle.  The  FMD  is 

endemic  in  Sesheke  (Western  Province),  Kazungula  (Southern  Province),  Mbala  and 

Nakonde (Northern Province), but in 2004 spread to parts of Central and other Southern 

Province  districts.  CBPP  is  endemic  in  areas  of  Western  Province,  North-western, 

Southern  (Kazungula)  and  extreme  Northern  Province  Districts.  East  Coast  Fever  areas 

include  Eastern,  Southern,  Central,  Lusaka  and  Northern  Provinces.  Most  of  the  areas 

affected  by  these  diseases  are  also  prone  to  drought  and  occasionally  floods.  Livestock 

movement  bans  associated  with  control  measures  often  disrupt  the  cattle  enterprise 

associated  trade,  affecting  farmers,  beef  traders  and  consumers  of  cattle  products.  This 

often  exacerbates  farmers’  vulnerability  to  the  effects  of  drought/floods  especially  in 

Southern  province  by  taking  away  the  means  to cultivate  their  land  (draught  power)  as 

well  as  one  of  the  most  reliable  income  sources  (Tembo,  et.al.,  2006).  Under  normal 

circumstances, in these farming systems, livestock acts as some form of insurance against 

poor weather and subsequent crop failure.  

 

In  the  early  part  of  2008,  following  the  occurrence  of  floods,  FMD  broke  out  in  some 

districts  of  Southern  (Monze,  Namwala,  Mazabuka  and  Itezhi  tezhi)  and  Western 

(Sesheke,  Senanga  and  Mongu)  provinces.  The  outbreak  of  the  FMD  in  Mazabuka, 

Monze and Namwala were attributed to contact between cattle and wild game following 

the movement of the former from the traditional grazing lands in the plains to the upland 

forests to escape the flooding that had occurred around February 2008. In order to control 

FMD and  stop it  from spreading, government through the Department of Livestock and 

Veterinary  Services  imposed  a  ban  on  the  movement  of  Livestock  from  Southern  and 

Western provinces. It also embarked on vaccination of cattle in districts affected by FMD 

in the two provinces.  

 

In  a  bid  to  compliment  government  efforts  to  control  economically  important  Trans-

boundary  Animal  Diseases  (TADs),  such  as  CBPP  and  Anthrax  in  Western  and  North 

western Provinces, FAO with funding from the European Union assisted Government in 

 

 
 
 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

22 

carrying out effective vaccinations against the diseases from November 2007 to January 

2008.  As  a  result  of  the  exercise,  there  haven’t  been  any  new  reported  cases  of  these 

disease  incidences  after  the  recent  floods.  However,  FMD  outbreak  continues  to  be  a 

problem in parts of Western and Southern Provinces. In order to insure sustained control 

of  FMD,  resources  should  be  made  available  for  timely  vaccinations,  surveillance  and 

diagnostic services. 

 

2.3. Water and Sanitation 

The Government continues to implement the National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation 

Programme  (NRWSSP)  whose  main  objective  is  to  provide  sustainable  and  equitable 

access to safe water supply and proper sanitation to meet basic needs for improved health 

and  poverty  alleviation  for  Zambia’s  rural  population  and  contribute  to  achievement  of 

the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  for  water  and  sanitation.  The  National 

Urban  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Programme  (NUWSSP)  is  also  being  developed, 

whose  objective  is  to  facilitate  peri-urban  and  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation 

infrastructure development and rehabilitation.  

Other  programmes  being  implemented  are  the  National  Solid  Waste  management 

Programme  whose  objective  is  to  facilitate  improved  environmental  management  and 

reduce  sanitation  diseases  through  collection  of  solid  waste  and  construction  of  VIP 

latrines; the Water Resources Action Programme (WRAP) whose overall objective is to 

ensure that Zambia’s water resources are  managed and utilised  for  maximum  economic 

benefit in an equitable and sustainable manner with strong stakeholder participation;  and 

the  water  supply  regulatory  body  called  National  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Council 

(NWASCO)  which  issues  licences  to  all  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  service 

providers in Zambia and has now extended to the peri-urban.. The Department of Water 

Affairs is carrying out exploration programmes for development of ground water and the 

development  of  surface  water  sources  through  dam  construction,  rain  water  harvesting 

and  protection  of  springs  and  also  monitors  the  development  of  water  resources  in  the 

country.   

 

 
 
 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

23 

Based  on  constructed  water  and  sanitation  facilities,  access  to  safe  water  supplies  is 

estimated  at  86%  for  urban  population  while  37%  of  Zambia’s  rural  population  have 

access  to  safe  water.  The  estimated  coverage  for  proper  sanitation  is  41%  for  urban 

population and only 13% for the rural population. Rural coverage figures uses “sanplat” 

as  proper  sanitation  facility.  It  is  also  estimated  that  approximately  30%  do  not  have 

access to any type of sanitation facility and that 30% of the existing water points in rural 

areas are not functioning.  

In  recent  years  the  country  has  experienced  varying  rainfall  amounts  and  patterns 

resulting  in  droughts  and  floods  of  varying  severity  in  different  parts  of  the  country. 

Flood  damages  due  to  small  rivers’  inundation  and  inadequate  drainage  systems  occur 

during the rainy season. Rural communities (people, livestock, crops, and infrastructure) 

are  the  most  vulnerable  to  floods,  especially  in  the  flood  plains,  valleys  and  near  small 

rivers that are prone to flash flooding. 

 

 

2.4. Health 

 

Health is one of the major factors with significant impact on the living conditions of the 

population.  The  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Zambia  is  committed  to  improving  the 

quality  of  health  for  all  Zambians  through  its  efforts  to  improve  health  care  delivery. 

Since 1992, Zambia has been Implementing comprehensive health sector reforms  aimed 

at  developing  the  necessary  capacities  to  ensure    equity  of  access  to  cost  -effective, 

quality health care services as close to the family as possible . An important component 

of  the  health  policy  reform  is  the  restructured  Primary  Health  Care  (PHC)  programme, 

which aims to, among other things; deal with the main health problems in the community 

including child and maternal health.  

 

According  to  the  annual  health  statistical  bulletin  of  2007  the  top  ten  causes  of  health 

facility  visitation  were  malaria,  respiratory  Infection  (non  pneumonia),  diarrhoea  (non 

bloody),  trauma,  skin  Infections,  respiratory  infections  (pneumonia),  muscular  skeletal 

and connective tissue, digestion system (not infection) eye , ear, nose /throat infection. 

 

 
 
 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

24 

Overall, Maternal Mortality  Rates (MMR) and Under-five Mortality  Rates (U-5 MR) in 

Zambia were among the highest in the region (ZDHS, 2007). The major causes of child 

mortality  are  malaria,  respiratory  infection,  diarrhoea,  malnutrition  and  anaemia 

(including  HIV  and  AIDS)  while  maternal  mortality  is  largely  due  to  Obstetric  causes 

such  as  postpartum  haemorrhage,  sepsis,  obstructed  labour,  post-abortion  complications 

and eclampsia. Malaria, anaemia and HIV and AIDS also contribute significantly to high 

MMR.  Other  contributing  factors  include  delays  in  accessing  healthcare  at  community 

and health centre levels both in rural and urban areas. 

 

Several  interventions  have  been  put  in  place  to  reduce  the  burden  of  disease  in  the 

country. Achievements in malaria prevention and treatment included 436,439 nets treated 

nationwide, distribution of approximately 2,400,000 ITNs distributed by October 2007, in 

indoor  residual  house  spraying    (IRHS);  entomological  and  parasitological  surveys 

conducted in IRS districts; needs assessment conducted to facilitate for IRS scale up from 

15  to  36  districts  and  strengthening    clinical  diagnosis  and  treatment.  In  maternal, 

neonatal and child care programmes health, orientation of MCH coordinators in focused 

antenatal care, maternal death review, scaling up of reproductive health services through 

strong  referral  system  e.g.  transport,  integration  of  prevention  of  mother  to  child 

(PMTCT)  are  being  implemented.  Due  to  the  increase  in  the  number  of  ART  centres 

(from  145  in  2006  to  197  by  June  2007),  voluntary  counselling  and  testing  services 

increased leading to more clients accessing ART (from 78,683 in 2006 to 156,783). The 

health  sector  has  also  continued  to  procure  and  supply  drugs,  health  centre  kits  and 

community health worker kits for all the districts to meet the shortages of these supplies. 

 

However,  despite  the  significant  efforts  and  resources  invested  into  these  reforms,  and 

major  achievements  made,  the  health  sector  has  continued  to  face  significant  obstacles 

and  challenges  which  have  continued  to  adversely  affect  performance    and  made  it 

difficult to provide assured quality basic health care services to all. Some of the obstacles 

and challenges that have  led the sector not to achieve desirable  level of development in 

the health service delivery include; 

 

 
 
 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

25 

•  High disease burden exacerbated by the impact of malaria and HIV/AIDS which 

are responsible for the majority of morbidities and mortalities.   

• 

 Increase in the numbers of healthcare seekers partly attributed to public response 

to the implementation of the of user fee removal policy in 54 rural districts. 

•  Continued  critical  shortage  of  and  unbalanced  distribution  of  qualified  health 

workers at all levels of public health care system. 

•  Continued shortages and erratic supply of essential drugs and medical supplies. 

• 

Inadequate  and  poor  state  of  essential  infrastructure,  equipment  and  transport 

especially in the rural areas. 

     

Nevertheless  notwithstanding  these  obstacles  and  challenges  the  Ministry  of  health  has 

continued to implement the health sector reforms with the hope of achieving sustainable 

improvements in health sector performance. 

     

2.5. Nutrition 

 

The  period  from  birth  to two  years  of  age  is  important  for optimal  growth,  health,  and 

development.  Unfortunately,  this  period  is  often  marked  by  prevalence  of  growth 

faltering,  micronutrient deficiencies, and common childhood  illnesses  such  as diarrhoea 

and acute respiratory infections (ARI). In Zambia, malnutrition is a serious public health 

concern. It  is currently  estimated that about 1.1 million children  in  Zambia are  stunted, 

while  about  120,000  and  456,000  children  are  wasted  and  underweight  respectively 

(ZDHS,  2007).  In  addition,  Zambia  has  one  of  the  highest  malnutrition  case  fatality 

(~45%)  in  the  region.  According  to  the  Zambia  Demographic  survey  of  2007,  the 

vulnerable child age group to malnutrition of all type are children  between the 12 to 35 

months old.  

  

During a disaster, where household livelihoods are disrupted, food and nutrition security 

of  the  affected  population(s),  particularly  children  and  women  of  child  bearing  age  is 

affected.

2.5.1. Trends of Malnutrition at National Level 

According to the Zambia Health Demographic Survey (ZDHS), chronic malnutrition has 

declined, by about 8% over the years. Stunting levels have reduced from 47% in 2001 to 

39%  in  2007.  Acute  malnutrition  (wasting)  has  remained  the  same  (5%)  while  the 

proportion of underweight children  has also reduced  from 28% percent to 19 percent in 

2007.  

Analysis  by rural - urban shows a decline  for both rural and urban populations. In rural 

and urban areas stunting has declined from 51 % in 2001-2 to 42% in 2007 and from 37 

% to 33% respectively during the same reference period. 

 

2.5.2. Trends of Malnutrition at Provincial Level  

A  comparison  of  malnutrition  status  at  provincial  level  shows  that  stunting  is  highest 

among  rural  provinces,  Luapula  (50%),  Eastern  (44%)  Northern  (42%)  and  Central 

(46%)  (Refer to Table  below). These are the provinces that have  few delivery services 

and limited infrastructure and have consistently shown to have higher malnutrition levels 

in other surveys such as the Living Conditions Monitoring survey (LCMS). 

 

Even with these high proportions of stunting being reported in these provinces, there has 

been an improvement in stunting since 2001 with exception of Central province. Eastern, 

Northern  and  Western  provinces  recorded the  highest  declines  ranging  from  15  to  12% 

(Refer  to  Table  3  below).  Trends  in  wasting  show  that  only  Copperbelt  and  Northern 

provinces  have  improved  in  the  levels  of  wasting,  while  Western,  Southern,  North-

Western and Lusaka provinces have been stable with slight changes. Wasting in Central, 

Eastern  and  Luapula  has  however  worsened.  The  overall  underweight  levels  among 

children under the age of five years showed an improvement in all the provinces. Eastern 

province  recorded  a  higher  improvement  (32.1%  in  2001  to  17.1%  in  2007),  while 

Central province recorded the lowest underweight improvement (26.6% in 2001 to 20.0% 

in 2007).

While  it  has  always  been  conceived  as  a  factor  of  personal  and  national  development, 

education in Zambia has continued to exhibit fairly low growth. This is manifested in low 

progression rate, high drop out rate, low gross and net enrolment ratios, and the general 

plummeting quality. Of clear concern to all stakeholders in the provision of education, is 

the  need  to  meet  the  challenge  of  education  for  all  (EFA),  with  the  perfect  intention  of 

maximizing  quality  over  quantity.  The  recently  developed  National  Education  Strategic 

Plan  “Educating  our  future”  is  a  most  recent  government  framework  to  guide  the 

education  provision  process  in  the  country  (Commonwealth  Fund).  The  plan  spans 

between 2003 and 2007. The plan  is  supported by a  number of donors through a sector 

pool funding mechanism and a small number of donors are into project support funding. 

What is contained in the Strategic Plan is a mere expression of interest by the government 

to collaborate with other stakeholders on ECCED, coordinate life skills training for youth 

across relevant ministries, develop a programme to set up adult literacy programmes and 

strengthen the gender component at primary and  secondary  levels. There  is, however, a 

striking absence of a direct mention of the EFA goals in the strategic plan, and how the 

Ministry  of  Education  (MoE)  and  other  ministries  with  an  education  agenda,  wish  to 

address them in terms of strategies and financing. 

 

The Education system in Zambia consists of academic learning at primary, secondary and 

tertiary  levels.  However,  the  lower  levels  of  primary  and  secondary  are  currently  being 

 

 
 
 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

28 

reorganized into two levels, namely Basic education, running from grades 1 to 9 and high 

school running from grade 10 to 12. 

 

The  government,  through  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MoE),  has  now  started  a  national 

process focusing on addressing the EFA goals in an effort to meet the 2015 MDG targets. 

The EFA Secretariat has  been assigned to coordinate the development of the EFA plan. 

The process is participatory, involving a wider cross-section of NGOs and civil society.  

 

The  current  Zambia  national  education  policy  document  “Educating  our  Future”,  laid 

down a clear vision for reforms of the whole education sector focusing on: 

 

 

• 

Increasing access to quality education for all at all levels of the education system; 

•  Achieving  high  pupil  retention,  and  progression  and  completion  rates  with 

emphasis on girls and the poor and vulnerable; 

•  Supplying adequate trained and motivated teachers and lecturers for all levels;  

•  Reviewing  the  curriculum  at  basic,  high  school  and  tertiary  levels  to  provide 

relevant skills and knowledge; 

•  Supplying sufficient learning/teaching materials for all levels; 

•  Effective decentralization of education delivery, and; 

•  Management/mitigation of HIV/AIDS. 

The  government’s  thrust  on  education  is  to  achieve  increased  and  equitable  access  to 

quality education at all levels through a variety of policy decisions, initiatives / strategies 

and programmes, which are well articulated in the Strategic Plan include the abolition of 

schools fees, support to alternative modes of delivery, introduction of bursaries to carter 

for the most vulnerable. The MoE has prepared the National Implementation Framework 

(NIF)  to  guide  the  translation  of  these  policy  decisions  and  programmes  into  activities 

aimed at achieving national policy on education “Educating Our Future.” 

 

 
 
 

 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

29 

As a realization of the MDGs where universal primary education  for all  is emphasized, 

government seems to be doing a lot towards achieving this, but a lot of work still needs to 

be done, especially in the rural areas. 

 

Zambia  has  8,013  schools  classified  as  basic,  583  schools  classified  as  secondary,  14 

training  colleges  and  3  public  universities  (Education  statistics  bulletin  2007). 

Additionally  there  are  2,716  community  schools,  initiated,  developed  and  run  by 

communities with minimal support from the government and development organizations. 

These  community  schools  though  not  fully  supported  by  the  government,  they  are 

expected to follow the school curriculum. 

 

The total school enrolment for grades 1 to 9 in 2006 was 2, 986, 781 while in 2007 it was 

3,  166,310  representing  an  increase  of  6%.  The  enrolment  for  grades  10  to  12  in  2006 

was 193, 843 while in 2007 it was 219,132 representing an increase of 13% (source…). It 

is  important  to  note  that  there  has  been  a  marked  increase  in  enrolment  due  to  the 

introduction  of  free  primary  education  and  improvement  in  quality  of  school  buildings 

(source…).  The  number  of  out  of  school  children  has  been  declining  since  2000. 

According to the 2007 Education Statistics bulletin, the number of out of school children 

in the 7-18 years age group were 65, 185 males and 173, 380 females representing 6.7 % 

of the total population.  

 

The  Ministry  of  Education  has  divided  infrastructure  in  three  categories  namely 

permanent, temporary and incomplete structures. The permanent structures are structures 

built with concrete that can serve for many years, usually at high cost using skilled labour 

and quality  materials. The temporary  structures are temporal  in  nature built as  stop gap 

measure  to  provide  basic  infrastructure.  The  incomplete  structures  are  designed  to  be 

permanent structures but are still under construction and are often already  in use  before 

completed. 

 

At  basic  school  level,  as  of  2007,  there  were  26,546  permanent  and  8,132  temporal 

classrooms.  At  secondary  level,  there  were  7,292  permanent  and  193  temporal 

 

 
 
 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

30 

classrooms.  The  number  of  temporal  classrooms  accounted  for  23.5  %  at  basic  school 

level and 2.6% at secondary level. The majority of community schools are made of pole 

and mud, making them more susceptible to damage from natural induced hazards such as 

floods. 

 
2.7. Social Protection 
 
Social Protection is a new concept in Zambia. However, there have been new strides in 

the  way  programmes  are  implemented  to  address  issues  of  Social  Protection.  Social 

protection refers to policies and practices that protect and promote the livelihoods and 

welfare of people suffering from critical levels of deprivation, and/or are vulnerable to 

risks  and  shocks.  In  an  emergency,  these  risks,  shocks  or  forces  cause  or  increase 

chances  of  individual  and  communities  becoming  more  impoverished  since  the 

individual  depends  on  resources,  assets,  or  support  mechanisms  sufficient  to  mitigate 

the effects from such situations. 

 

Zambia experienced floods during the 2007/08 rainy season in which many districts were 

affected causing already impoverished households and communities to move further into 

deep poverty. It is estimated that 67% of the population in Zambia are poor and hence if 

sudden impoverishing forces such as floods occur more and more people are not able to 

cope and  hence  become poorer. It is, therefore, necessary  for the government and other 

stakeholders  to  ensure  that  mechanisms  and  systems  that  ensure  resilience  for 

communities in emergency are in place. 

 

2.7.1. Children and Women  

 

The situation of children and women in Zambia remains largely one of vulnerability and 

is exacerbated during an emergency. According to the VAC Report (2008), the common 

forms of protection issues during an emergency include: early marriages, assault, sexual 

exploitation, rape, child defilement, separation and HIV/AIDS. The extent of the forms of 

protection issues varies.   

 

 
 
 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

31 

It is therefore imperative that children and women, the most vulnerable groups in society, 

should  be  entitled  to  some  kind  of  special  protection  by  the  government  and  the 

community  during  an  emergency.  This  protection  should  particularly  work  against  all 

forms  of  discrimination  such  as  violence,  oppression,  sexual  abuse,  exploitation,  and 

abandonment.  Ideally,  children  and  women  should  have  access  to  all  the  rights  on 

protection written into law by both the Zambian and the international community.  

Though the VAC (2008) report  indicate that  incidences of  violence against women and 

children  in  the  communities  and  camps  during  the  2007/2008  flooding  period  were  not 

very common, it is important to bear in mind that most protection issues are difficult to 

detect and may go unreported in most cases.   

2.8. Human Habitation and Shelter 
 
Shelter is necessary to provide security and personal safety, protection from the climate 

and enhance resistance to ill health and disease. Although housing is a basic necessity for 

humans, 80% of the total housing stock in Zambia could be classified as informal (Vision 

2030, P 10). About 65 % of Zambian households occupy traditional housing units 

(LCMS, 2004). Out of this percentage, 91% in rural areas occupy traditional housing 

compared with 22% in urban areas. 

 

The human settlements and shelter get affected and at times destroyed by the severity of 

the hazards of various kinds. This coupled with the poor, inappropriate and weak building 

materials  (mainly  pole,  mud  and  grass)  used  in  building  the  shelters  only  worsens  the 

vulnerability of human life, property and infrastructure to flood disasters. This may cause 

displacement, the nature and duration of which depend on the duration of the inundation 

or floods. 

 

Each time a flood occurs, an average of 10% of those affected require relocation and/or 

resettling  as  their  settlements  and  shelter  get  damaged  and  sometimes  completely 

destroyed.  It  is  therefore  important  for  the  government  to  implement  some  form  of 

transmigration, which  is a programme of  voluntary resettling those  communities  settled 

 

 
 
 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

32 

in  flood prone areas to higher and  safer  lands to avoid the repeated experience of same 

communities  being affected each time  floods occur. This would accelerate and enhance 

improved living conditions for vulnerable communities, reduce vulnerability and pressure 

on the government emergency response, rescue and support.  

 

Strategies  for  post-flood  settlements  programmes  need  to  be  based  on  the  impact  of 

flooding  on  settlement  and  shelter  and  their  long-term  consequences  rather  than  on  the 

immediate needs of flood victims which are short-term solutions.

3.0. FINDINGS  
 
3.1. General Demographics for the Sampled Population   
 
A total of 20 districts  in  six provinces were  covered during the In-depth  Assessment of 

which 92 percent were rural.  The majority of the household heads were in the productive 

age group of 20 to 39 years (44.7 percent) and 40 years to 59 years (36.5%) respectively. 

The  elderly  headed  households  (60  years  or  older)  were  quite  significant  representing 

about  16.8%  of  the  households  and  most  of  whom  are  widowed  (37.7%).  The  female-

headed households stood at 23.6% while the child-headed households were insignificant 

standing at only 0.7%.

36.5%  were  between  40  and  59 

years.  The  remaining  16.8%  of  the  married  household  heads  were  60  years  or  older. 

Cases of early marriages were actually insignificant standing at 0.7%. This is in line with 

the findings in the 2008 In-Depth Assessment where early marriages stood at 1%. 

 

The average  family  size  for  most households was 6  members, which  is  in  line  with the 

findings  of  the  Living  Conditions  Monitoring  Survey  (LCMS,  2004).  About  4%  of  the 

sampled  households  indicated  having  an  orphan  in  their  households.  However,  94%  of 

the  households  had  no  orphan.  The  assessment  also  revealed  that  household  heads  had 

diverse educational  levels. The  majority of respondents (50.7%) had primary education. 

A  further  31%  indicated  that  they  had  attained  secondary  education  while  14.6%

indicated that they had not been to school. The survey further revealed that 59.3% of the 

spouses had attained primary education while 20.3% had done secondary schooling.  

 

3.2. Livelihoods, Incomes and Expenditure Patterns 
 
3.2.1  Livelihoods 
 
The survey revealed that most of the sampled households indicated that the first highest 

livelihood  contributors  to their  incomes  were  cash  crop  production  (33%),  followed  by 

petty  trading/small  business  (17%),  casual  labour  (13%)  and  brewing,  remittances  and 

fishing all at seven percent (7%) as shown in the figure below.

3.2.2  Income Sources 
 
Income  sources  for  most  households  were  diverse.  The  major  income  sources  were 

cash/food crops sales, casual  labour, petty trading and  fishing (Fig 6). Other sources of

The  assessment  revealed  that there  were  no  major  differences  in  income  sources  of  the 

sampled  households  between  the  2007/08  and  the  2008/09  season  (Fig  6).  This  implies 

that no major impact was exerted on these sources by floods and/or water logging. 

 

3.2.3  Expenditure Patterns 
 

The assessment revealed that most of the sampled households spent their money on food 

compared to other non food items such as education and rent. Of the sampled households, 

18% spent between K48, 000 and K207, 000 on food while another 18% spent K50, 000 

and  more  on  education  with  a  further  15%  of  the  households  spending  K15,  000  and 

more  on  repaying  debts.  Furthermore,  the  assessment  also  revealed  that  9%  of  the 

sampled households spent K30, 000 on transport. Minimal expenditure was observed on 

alcohol, social events and rent.

There were very few households that 

indicated having more than one meal 

(1%) and two meals (7%) per day.  

 

The  assessment  revealed  that  the 

common 

coping 

strategies 

that 

sampled  households  employed  were 

eating of meals with vegetables (46%) and reliance on less preferred foods in the past six 

(6) months starting from December 2008 and May 2009. The assessment further revealed 

that 55% of the sampled  households regularly reduced the  number of  meals while 25% 

received food or money to buy food from relatives from outside the country and on food 

and/or  non  remittance  from  relatives.  Furthermore,  12%  of  the  sampled  households 

indicated that they reduced expenditure on hired labour or draught power due to hunger 

where  as  11%  of  them  indicated  reduced  expenditure  on  education  due  to  the  same 

reason.  About  14%  of  the  sampled  households  indicated  having  additional  household 

members  joining  the  income  generating  activities  for  the  first  time  to  compliment  the 

household food gaps. 

 

It is also worth noting that no major unsustainable coping mechanisms were employed to 

signal stress as a result of hunger from the sampled households. Notable ones employed 

were  withdrawing  children  aged  between  6  to  15  years  from  school  (6%),  sale  of 

productive  assets  (4%)  and  sale  of  household  assets  (7%).  This  is  a  sign  that  most  of 

these households resilience levels are progressively improving over time.

3.3. Agriculture and Food Security 

   
3.3.1. Household Food security 
 

The assessment revealed that most (94%) of the sampled households had access to arable 

land;  however  the  sizes  varied  from  district  to  district.  Out  of  the  twenty  (20)  districts 

assessed,  most  of  the  households  who  had  access  to  arable  land  amounting  to  two  (2) 

hectares  or  more  were  found  in  Kapiri  Mposhi  (8%),  Shang’ombo  (7%)  and  Serenje, 

Mporokoso,  Mungwi,  Kabompo,  Kasempa  and  Kaoma  all  at  6%  (see  figure  8). 

Furthermore, households indicated having less than or equal to half a hectare were mainly 

in Lukulu (11%), Kaoma (8%) and Mpika (7%).

38 

Of  the  households  that  indicated  having  access  to  arable  land,  twenty  seven  percent 

(27%)  cultivated  half  a  hectare  or  less,  thirty  percent  (30%)  cultivated  between  ½  to  1 

hectare, twenty two percent (22%) cultivated between 1 - 2 hectares during the 2007/08 

agricultural  season.  Furthermore,  fifteen  percent  (15%)  indicated  having  cultivated  two 

hectares and more. A further 6 percent indicated that they did not cultivate the land which 

they had. 

 

The production of cereals, mainly maize, had risen in all the assessed districts. Increase in 

production  of  the  staple  from  the  previous  season  ranged  between  4%  for  Mwinilunga 

and Kabompo to 39% for Lukulu.  

 

The contribution of own production to the household staple consumption stood at 79.2 % 

with  the  remaining  coming  from  other  sources  such  as  purchases,  remittances  and  gifts 

(see figures 10 and 11).  The assessment revealed that although the households had 

diverse livelihoods, own production still remained a dominant source of the staple food to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

the households.

The dominance of own production in most rural households, as was the case in the 2008 

assessment  entails  that  such  households  are  likely  to  be  food  insecure  arising  from  the 

floods experienced in their districts.  

 

3.3.2. Market Situation 
 

Generally, maize prices in assessed districts were higher in May 2009 with respect to the 

same  period  in  the  previous  season  with  very  few  exceptions.  The  price  increases  over 

the previous season are high for most areas with the highest reported in Kaoma (100%), 

while  Lukulu, Senanga,  Kalabo, Mwinilunga, Shang’ombo and Mongu reported at least 

50%  increase  in  price.  This  can  be  attributed to the  fact that  2008/09  marketing  season 

was a maize deficit year when most areas experienced low maize supply towards the end 

of  the  season  which  pushed  prices  up  significantly.  Therefore  May  2009  prices  still 

remained  high  as  the  new  harvest  had  not  yet  adequately  reached  the  market. 

Exceptionally  high  price  levels  were  recorded  in  Lukulu  (low  producing)  and  Kaoma 

(high producing area) which could signify high maize deficit levels on the market in May 

for these areas. The fact that the current marketing season which opened May 1, had low 

carryover stocks from the previous season meant that market prices were retained at high 

level at the start of the 2009/10 marketing season. The May period is also a period when 

household dependency on the  market starts to reduce due to availability of own  harvest 

and therefore prices in June are expected to be lower.

In  this  case,  the  May  prices  best  reflect  the  end  of  the  previous  market  stocks  on  the 

market  and  partly  extent  to  which  the  households  are  accessing  food  from  own 

production. 

 

The flood affected districts of western Zambia are also major livestock rearing districts. 

Cattle prices in the assessed districts either rose or remained stable with respect the prices 

which prevailed in December 2008. The fact that cattle prices in areas with relatively low 

December prices (lean season prices) increased in May 2009 shows that at the time of the 

assessment,  farmers  were  still  able  to  negotiate  for  higher  prices  and  therefore  not 

desperate  to  sale.  Furthermore,  the  comparatively  low  cattle  price  levels  in  Kalabo, 

Shang’ombo, Sesheke and Lukulu could be a reflection of the livestock market situation.

For the past few  years there  has  been  a  ban on  livestock movement (only carcasses are 

permitted)  out  of  western  Province  due  to  disease  outbreaks.  The  prices  of  smaller 

animals (goats) also showed a similar picture. Price of goats  mostly  increased  from the 

December  2008  levels,  implying  no  desperation  to  sale.    Furthermore,  it  was  also 

observed  that  the  lowest  prices  for  goats  (no  more  than  K600,  000)  were  reported  in 

Western Province (Sesheke, Senanga, Shang’ombo and Kaoma districts). 

 

Generally, at the time of the assessment, both the maize prices and the livestock prices do 

not reflect a desperate situation in the assessed areas this being the harvesting period and 

therefore not reflective of the post harvest situation. However, the relatively low prices of 

livestock in Western Province reflect the relatively low income from livestock sales that 

the middle and better off households obtain from such sales compared to the other areas.

3.3.3. Seasonal Calendar 
 
Out of the 268 sampled communities, 50% indicated that rainfall started in October while 

31%  indicated  rainfall  having  started  in  November.  It  was  evident  that  the  timings  on 

when  to  undertake  land  preparation  for  most  sampled  communities  tied  very  well  with 

the period when rainfall started. Furthermore, 24% of the communities indicated having 

started  land  preparation  in  October  while  61%  of  them  indicated  having  started  the 

planting of their main food and cash crops respectively. The communities also indicated 

that  the  peak  periods  for  the  land  preparation  and  planting  was  November  (29%)  and 

December (22%). The assessment  further revealed that first  main crop  for consumption 

for the sampled communities was maize (76%) and cassava (17%). 

 

It is worth noting that of the 268 sampled communities, 11% indicated that the main cash 

crop grown was ground nuts and rice while 6% indicated beans and 5% indicated maize 

as  their  main  cash  crop.  It  was  further  revealed  that  15%  of  the  sampled  communities 

indicated that milk production started in November when most pasture condition are just 

starting to improve with 8% indicating February when the activity was ending. The peak 

period  for  this  activity  was  found  to  December.  In  terms  of  sale  of  livestock,  46% 

indicated  that  the  activity  started  in  January  and  45%  indicated  the  end  of  the  same 

activity  ended  in  December.  The  assessment  further  revealed  that  labour  migration  was 

done  all  year  round,  however  it  was  found  to  be  less  pronounced  among  sampled 

communities  with  most  of  them  indicating  the  activity  started  in  January  (5%)  and  7% 

ending in December. 

 

For the communities whose livelihood is fishing, the assessment revealed that 20% of the 

sampled  communities  indicated  that  the  activity  started  in  March  while  22%  of  them 

indicated  the  activity  ended  in  December.  Furthermore,  15%  of  the  same  communities 

indicated that the peak  month of the activity was April as  most water bodies  have  high 

levels  resulting  into  increased  catches.  It  was  further  revealed  that  most  own  produced 

foods among the sampled communities ran out between October and February, however 

27% indicated that most own produced foods started running out in November while 43% 

of them indicated February as the month when own produced foods stops running out.

3.4. Water and Sanitation 
 
3.4.1. Drinking Water at Household 
 
The assessment revealed that there were diverse  water sources that sampled  households 

used for domestic purposes. It was established that 28% of the sampled households used 

unprotected well, 23% used boreholes and 17% used river/lake (see figure 12).

Water Sources

The assessment revealed that most of the unprotected water sources such as spring, well 

and  river  were  highly  prone  to  contamination  of  faecal  matter  due  to  flooding.  About 

36%  of  the  sampled  households  whose  main  water  source  was  unprotected  wells 

indicated  having a  household  member suffering  from diarrhoea. The assessment  further 

revealed that 22% of the households whose main water source was river/lake and 19% of 

the  households  whose  main  water  source  was  borehole  indicated  having  a  household 

member  suffering  from  diarrhoea.    Despite  the  unsafe  water  sources  that  the  sampled 

households used, 74% of them indicated that the water quality was good.

Of  the  sampled  households,  24%  indicated  that  they  treated  their  drinking  water.  The 

most commonly used method for water treatment was found to be use of chlorine (19%) 

and  boiling (5%). There were very  few households who resorted to filtration as a water 

treatment method.

Water Sources

Most of the common water sources used by the sampled households were not within their 

premises  as  only  4%  of  them  indicated  having  their  water  sources  in  their  premises. 

Furthermore, the assessment revealed that 45% of the sampled households indicated that 

water sources were with 100 to 500  meters while 32% of the  households  indicated that 

water  sources  were  located  at  a  distance  less  than  100  meters.  Overall,  there  is  clear 

evidence  that  most  of  these  water  sources  were  easily  accessible  by  the  sampled 

households.

3.4.2. Sanitation 
 
The assessment revealed that the main sanitary facilities used by the sampled households 

were  traditional  latrine  (67.8%)  and  flash  toilets  (25.1%).  The  assessment  further 

revealed  that  68%  of  the  sampled  households  whose  sanitary  facilities  were  traditional 

facilities  indicated  having  a  household  member  suffering  from  diarrhoea.  Furthermore, 

32%  of  the  sampled  household  who  indicated  that  they  had  no  sanitary  facility  had  a 

household  member  suffering  from  diarrhoea.  It  is  worth  noting  that  for  the  sampled 

households  whose  sanitary  facilities  were  VIP  latrines,  5%  of  them  indicated  having  a 

household member that suffered from diarrhoea.

3.5. Health 
The assessment revealed that 50% of the sampled households  indicated that having one 

household  member  who  got  sick  over  two  weeks  prior  to  the  survey.  The  assessment 

further revealed that of those households that had a household member that fell sick two

weeks  prior  to the  assessment,  28% of  them  indicated  fever/malaria  as  the  disease  that 

household member suffered from, 17% cough, 8% diarrhea and 2% scabies. In terms of 

the health care that the sick household members had, majority went for formal health care 

(37%) with others opting  for traditional  healers (3%), own  medication (4%) and private 

clinics 1%. 

 

The  survey  found  that  69.2%  of  the  under  five  children  had  suffered  from 

Fever/suspected malaria, diarrhoea (watery stool), Cough, or skin infection while 30.8% 

did not suffer from any illness. The figure below shows the prevalence of some common 

childhood illnesses from 2009 in-depth assessment. 

Figure 17: Prevalence of Common Childhood Illness 

In  looking  at the cases of 

diarrhoea,  it  was  noted 

that  of 

the 

affected 

households, 

the  water 

source 

was 

100-

500metres 

from 

the 

dwelling.  The  use  of 

unprotected wells was the 

highest source of drinking 

water  at  38%  whilst  the  least  used  source  of  drinking  water  was  piped  water  at  2.2%. 

57.1%  of  the  water  source  got  flooded  and  only  15.1%  households  had  access  to 

alternative water sources.  

 

3.5.2. Health Infrastructure  

From  the  assessment  it  was  found  that  each  district  had  one  health  infrastructure  either 

severely, moderately, low or having no effect at all. Only one clinic was severely affected 

due  to  the  floods  in  Shang’ombo.  The  assessment  further  indicated  that  Kabompo, 

Kasempa  and  Lukulu  had  health  infrastructures  moderately  affected.  The  floods  had  a 

low  impact  on  physical  health  infrastructure  in  Kawambwa,  Mufumbwe,  Mwinilunga, 

Zambezi,  Mongu,  Senanga  and  Sesheke.  Generally,  there  was  no  impact  of  floods  on 

physical health infrastructure in Kapiri Mposhi, Serenje, Mambwe, Mporokoso, Mungwi,

3.6. Nutrition 
 
3.6.1. Nutritional Status of Children 

 

Anthropometric  measurements  were  taken  from  a  total  of  1198  children  aged  0  -  59 

months. About 172 (1.0%) of the children had their anthropometric measurement flagged. 

Therefore the results on nutritional status are based on 1026 children aged 0-59 months.  

The  in-depth survey revealed that about 35% of the children (0 – 59  months) were  still 

being  breastfed.  The  results  further  show  that  34.9%  of  children  below  the  age  of  6 

months were already introduced to other foods. Only 64% of children above the age of 6 

months were given complementary foods. 

 

3.6.2. Household Food Consumption Pattern 

The  average  number  of  meals  that  the  households  were  reported  to  have  consumed  24 

hours prior to the survey (2 meals) was less than what the households consumed normally 

(3 meals).

3.6.3. Coverage of Public health / Nutrition Services 

 

The Assessment showed that vitamin A supplementation among children (6 – 59 months) 

stood at 61.6 percent while de-worming  for the same age group was 17.2 % (See Table 

6).  It  was  also  observed  that  the  supplementation  and  therapeutic  feeding  programs 

coverage  was  low  (2.0  and  1.4%  respectively).  The  number  of  children  who  were 

reported  to  have  been  on  therapeutic  feeing  program  at  the  point  of  survey  was  14 

(1.0%).The vitamin A supplementation and de-worming coverage results of the in-depth 

vulnerable assessment is lower compared to other surveys such as the ZDHS and the pilot 

nutrition surveillance.

3.6.4. Prevalence of Child Malnutrition 

 

The  nutrition  levels  of  the  children  in  the  surveyed  population  are  comparable  to other 

surveys.  The  proportion  of  children  aged  0-59  months  who  were  stunted  was  45.5 

percent.  Wasting  and  underweight  were  reported  at  3.6%  and  15.2%  respectively  (see 

Table 7).

Prevalence of Acute Malnutrition (Wasting)  

 

The  prevalence  of  Severe  Acute  Malnutrition  (SAM)  was  found  to  be  1.4%.  The 

proportion  of  children  with  bilateral  oedema  was  0.3%.  Global  Acute  Malnutrition 

(GAM) was 3.6%. 

 

Prevalence of Acute Malnutrition (Wasting) by Age group  

 

The  survey  results  showed  that  wasting  increased  with  increase  in  age.  Global  Acute 

Malnutrition  (Wasting)  and  Severe  Acute  Malnutrition  (SAM)  peaked  among  children 

aged 36 to 47 months (refer to Table 8).

Prevalence of Under-weight by Age group 

The  prevalence  of  underweight  increased  with  increase  in  age.  The  results  show  that 

prevalence of underweight was higher among children aged 36-47 months with 31% and 

was nonexistent among children aged 0-5 months.

Prevalence of Chronic Malnutrition (Stunting) by Age Group 

 

Stunting  is  apparent  among  children  aged  0-5  months  and  increases  rapidly  during  the 

first year of life. By the time children are 6-11 months old, up to 25% are short for their 

age. By age 48-60 months over half the children (58%) are stunted.

3.7. Education 
 
In the  last 6 months, 97% of respondents  indicated that they did not have any  boys and 

girls  that  dropped  out  of  school.  On  the  percent  of  children  that  dropped  out,  2.6%  of 

respondents  indicated  that only  1  male  child  dropped  out of  school  and  2.5%  indicated 

that only 1 female child dropped out of school. The reason for the slight drop out of 2.6% 

for both boys and girls was either because the family could not afford fees, work outside 

for food or cash or children not interested in education.  The main reason however for the 

slight drops out was lack of school fees.

The data showed that 15% of the respondents who were heads of  households had  never 

been  to  school  and  51%  had  completed  primary  school,  while  only  31%  completed 

secondary  school.  The  assessment  showed  that  97%  of  respondents  indicated  that  they 

did not pull children out of school due to the flood situation.

3.8. Social Protection 
 
All the twenty districts reported some sort of protection  issues. The type of violence by 

district is indicated in the table below. All districts reported the occurrence of assault, 19 

reported the occurrence of early marriages while 12 reported rape, 10 child defilement, 7 

sexual exploitation and 3 reported the occurrence other types of violence.

The study defined an orphan as a person below the age of fifteen years who had lost both 

parents. There were a total number of 465 double orphans aged below 15 that were being 

kept by 5.65% of the assessed households. 

 

Figure 28: Early Marriages versus Age of Household Head 

The  results  from  the  assessment 

show 

that 

there  was 

some 

relationship  between  the  distance  to 

the  water  source  and  the  number  of 

households  that  reported  incidences 

of  child  defilement.  Out  of  20 

households that reported defilement, 

65%  indicated  that  the  incidences 

happened  in  the  distance  of  over  100meters.    However,  there  was  no  significant 

difference between the number of incidences of rape that happened within the 100 meters 

distance and those that happened in a distance of more than 100 meters.

The  analysis  of  livelihood  sources  by  prevalence  of  violence  revealed  that  there  was  a 

link  between  prevalence  of  violence  and  livelihood  sources.  The  prevalent  causes  of 

violence  included  begging,  petty  trading,  beer  brewing,  skilled  trading,  small  business, 

formal  salary  and  crop  production.  There  should  be,  therefore,  targeted  protection 

awareness  activities  for  households  earning  livelihood  through  the  stated  livelihood 

options.

3.8.1. Community Response to Protection 

 

Out  of  the  268  communities  that  were  assessed,  3.8%  of  them  reported  that  they  had 

missing  children  during  the  floods.    There  were,  on  the  other  hand,  20.1%  of  the  total 

communities that engaged children in some paid and unpaid child labour. 

 

The assessment reviews that most communities had some measures for HIV prevention. 

The government provided measures for HIV prevention to 74.3% of communities while 

the community and NGO provided to 49.1% and 61.6% respectively. There were 79.8% 

of  the  communities  assessed  responded  that  there  was  an  existence  of  reporting 

mechanisms  for  rights  violations  and  the  percentages  of  existence  of    mechanisms    in 

communities were : police (76.2 %), local authority (71.8%), local health clinic (26.7%), 

and humanitarian (5.8%) reporting systems.  

 

 

3.9. Human Habitation and Shelter 
 

The survey revealed that of the total number of households that were affected by floods, 

10%  were  displaced.  This  translates  into  a  total  of  280  households  displaced  (1,680 

people).    The  displacement  of  the  households  was  due  mainly  to  the  weak  housing 

structures which are mainly built with pole, mud and grass. This coupled with location of 

the  houses  along  the  flood  water  ways  only  enhanced  the  vulnerability  of  the  houses, 

people and their properties.  

 

Of  the  280  displaced  households,  76.5%  were  male  headed  while  23.5%  were  female 

headed. Furthermore, 64.7% had traditional hut type of houses while the 28.7% lived in 

improved  traditional  hut  type  of  houses  and  3.7%  conversional,  2.9%  other  types  of 

houses.  

The assessment results showed that there was a correlation between the level of education 

of the household heads and the number of the households that were displaced. The figure

below  shows  the  level  of  education  for  the  heads  of  displaced  households  and  the 

corresponding number of households displaced for each level of education.

The figure above shows that 54% of the displaced household heads had acquired only up 

to  primary  education,  27%  had  reached  secondary  education,  17%  had  never  been  to 

school  and  2%  tertiary  education.  These  figures  show  that the  largest  proportion  of  the 

displaced  households  had  acquired  low  levels  of  education  and  consisted  of  those  that 

had never been to school and those that had acquired primary education.  

 

A  bigger  proportion  of  the  displaced  households  were  headed  by  persons  in  the  most 

productive to less productive age groups. 51.7% of the displaced households were headed 

by  person  in  the  age  range  of  20  to  39  years  of  age,  31.6%  in  40  to  59  years  old  and 

15.2% for the 60 years and above age group. The other group was the 16 to 19 years old 

at 1.1% and 0.4% for child  headed households  below the age of 15  years. Furthermore, 

the survey established that of the total number of households displaced; only 7.5% of the 

households had carryover food stocks from the previous season.

4. CONCLUSIONS (Sector Based)  
 

4.1. Infrastructure 

 

A total of 327 structures were damaged or washed away. This includes roads, bridges and 

culverts in different districts of the country (refer to the Technical Report on the Washed 

Away and  Affected Drainage Structures by the 2008/9 Heavy Rains, RDA, May 2009). 

The school infrastructure has been covered under education. 

 

4.2. Agriculture and Food Security 

 

The  production  of  the  staple  in  all  the  twenty  districts  had  increased  with  the  increase 

ranging from 4% to 39%. However, owing to the fact that most of these districts have had 

floods  the  past  three  seasons,  it  is  likely  that  this  marginal  increase  would  afford  the 

community enough resilience in terms of food security. 

 

Cattle prices in the assessed districts either rose or remained stable with respect to prices 

which prevailed in December 2008. The fact that cattle prices in areas with relatively low 

December  prices  (lean  season  prices)  increased  in  May  shows  that  at  the  time  of  the 

assessment,  farmers  were  still  able  to  negotiate  for  higher  prices  and  therefore  not 

desperate to sale.  

 

The price  increases over the previous season were  high  for  most areas with the  highest 

reported  in  Kaoma  (100%),  while  Lukulu,  Senanga,  Kalabo,  Mwinilunga,  Shang’ombo 

and Mongu reported at least 50% increase in price. This can be attributed to the fact that 

2008/09  marketing  season  was  a  maize  deficit  year  when  most  areas  experienced  low 

maize  supply  towards  the  end  of  the  season  which  pushed  prices  up  significantly. 

Therefore May 2009 prices still remained high as the new harvest had not yet adequately 

reached the market. 

 

 
 
 

 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

60 

Of the twenty (20) districts visited, 7 districts were found to have most households which 

had experienced drastic reduction in their harvest of the main staple. A total of 110, 651 

people  (18,442  households)  were  found  to  be  food  insecure  and  will  require  some 

assistance.  Four  districts  namely  Kapiri  Mposhi,  Kasempa,  Mambwe  and  Mongu  were 

likely  to  face  food  insecurity  as  the  analysis  showed  that  the  situation  in  the  districts 

could go either way.  

 

4.3. Nutrition 

 

The 2009 in-depth vulnerability assessment revealed that vitamin A supplementation and 

de-worming program among children (6 – 59 months) was as low as 61.6% and 17.2 %. 

These  coverage  results,  on  vitamin  A  supplementation  and  de-worming,  are  lower 

compared to other community surveys that have been conducted before. 

 

It  was  also  observed  that  the  supplementation  and  therapeutic  feeding  programs 

coverages  were  low  (2.0  and  1.4%  respectively).  The  number  of  children  who  were 

reported  to  have  been  on  therapeutic  feeing  program  at  the  point  of  survey  was  14 

(1.0%). 

 

The  in-depth  assessment  revealed  that  the  prevalence  of  Severe  Acute  Malnutrition 

(SAM)  was  1.4%.  The  proportion  of  children  with  bilateral  oedema  was  0.3%.  Global 

Acute Malnutrition (GAM) was 3.6%. Underweight rate among under-five children was 

15.2%,  of  which  about  5%  were  severe.  Stunting  was  the  most  prevalent  form  of 

malnutrition in the flood affected areas. The levels of malnutrition (wasting) in the flood 

affected areas were normal, while the levels of underweight were slightly higher.      

 

4.4. Water and Sanitation 

 

The assessment revealed that most of the unprotected water sources such as spring, well 

and  rivers  were  highly  prone  to  contamination  of  faecal  matter  due  to  flooding.  About 

36%  of  the  sampled  households  whose  main  water  source  was  unprotected  wells 

 

 
 
 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

61 

indicated  having a  household  member suffering  from diarrhoea. The assessment  further 

revealed that 22% of the households whose main water source was river/lake and 19% of 

the  households  whose  main  water  source  was  borehole  indicated  having  a  household 

member  suffering  from  diarrhoea.    Despite  the  unsafe  water  sources  that  the  sampled 

households used, 74% of them indicated that the water quality was good. 

 

4.5. Health 

 

The survey found that 69.2% of the under five children had suffered from fever/suspected 

malaria,  diarrhoea  (watery  stool),  cough,  or  skin  infection  while  30.8%  did  not  suffer 

from any illness. The assessment established that immunization coverage was high in all 

the assessed districts. The measles coverage of 86.5 % was recorded among children aged 

between  6-59  months,  93.7%  was  recorded  for  OPV  and  94.1%  for  DPT  immunization 

while  the  BCG  coverage  was  found  to  be  at  97.2%.  A  small  percentage  of  the  eligible 

children  did  not  receive  vaccines  while  0.9%  of  the  child  caretakers  did  not  know 

whether  the  child  had  been  immunized  or  not.  Shang’ombo  was  the  only  district  that 

reported severe damage on the health facility while Kabompo, Kasempa and Lukulu had 

their  facilities  moderately  affected.  Kawambwa,  Mufumbwe,  Mwinilunga,  Zambezi, 

Mongu, Senanga and Sesheke reported minor damages on the health facilities. However, 

there  was  no  impact  of  floods  on  health  infrastructure  in  Kapiri  Mposhi,  Serenje, 

Mambwe, Mporokoso, Mungwi, Chavuma and Kalabo districts.   

 

4.6. Education 

 

The assessment indicated that the floods did not have remarkable impact on school drop 

out. It was established that the reasons why 2.6% of children dropped out were due to the 

fact that the family could not afford school fees. The other reasons for school drop – out 

were  because  of  pregnancy  on  the  part  of  girls  and  ill  health.  The  assessment  also 

established  that  schools  in  the  assessed  districts  had  suffered  damage  due  to  the  heavy 

rainfall. 

 

 
 
 

 

                                                                                                                                                                                          

62 

4.7. Social Protection 

 

The assessment showed that there were protection issues in the assessed districts although 

the  cases  were  very  low.  The  most  common  cases  in  order  of  ranking  were;  early 

marriages (35%), assault (25%), sexual exploitation (14%), rape (11%), child defilement 

(9%) and other types of violence (1%). In most of the instances the main perpetrators of 

these  cases  were  relatives/neighbours  and  other  people  (94%),  while  development 

workers constituted 4% of the perpetrators. 

   

4.8. Human Habitation and Shelter 
 
 

The floods displaced total of 280 households (1, 680 people) with the Western Province 

being the worst affected. All the displaced communities were actually in the rural areas.

Annex 11: Scenario Building 

West Bank Livelihood Zone (Chavuma West, Zambezi West, Lukulu West, Kalabo, Senanga West and Shang’ombo) 

Basic description of affected area and population   

 
 
Name and location of area 
selected 
 
 
 
Characteristics of wealth groups  

Parts of Western and North Western Provinces - The Zambezi West Bank livelihood zone stretches from Chavuma District 
in the west, dissects Zambezi and Lukulu Districts, includes part of Kalabo and Senanga Districts, and finally ends up in 
Shang’ombo District. The area is prone to periodic hazards namely floods and cattle diseases.  The zone is mostly rural and 
inaccessible due to poor infrastructure arising from the nature of the terrain and its remoteness. It has no passable all year 
road network and hence it is one of the most inaccessible parts of the country. 
Livelihoods are based on small scale subsistence agriculture, livestock rearing and fishing. The main food crops are 
Cassava Maize, rice and Millet which are mainly grown for own consumption with very little traded.    The main livestock 
kept are cattle goats and chicken. Cattle production is threatened by CBPP disease which is endemic in the area. The 
disease incidence has caused loss of draught power, loss of manure and  loss of cattle sales income 
Accessibility to infrastructure (transport, communication, Markets, education, health etc) decreases as you move away 
from the river front. The zone has limited passable all year road networks due to terrain and remoteness 
The major determinant of wealth in the livelihood zone is cattle ownership.  Apart from draught power and cash income, 
the manure produced from cattle is used to fertilize farmlands and has a significant contribution to crop production in the 
zone.   

Generally there are three major wealth groups:  better off, middle and poor.  Wealth status has huge implications in terms 
of access to food and income.  Better off households are able to cultivate larger areas of land and employ labour.  As a 
result, they produce more food and earn more income.  Their livestock also act as a direct source of income through sales.  
Poor households, in contrast, usually access plough oxen through an exchange for their labour and this generally means 
that they cultivate only small areas and plant late.   

The poor in this zone typically have no livestock at all, and even rarely own chickens. The middle households have 1 to 10 
cattle.  Better-off households own 10 to 30 cattle, 5 to 7 goats and about 2 oxen.  The better off households also typically 
own at least one ox-cart, which is a major means for transporting goods like the dried fish and kakeya1.  They also earn 
cash income by hiring out ox-carts. They draw labour from the poor in exchange for plough oxen. 

The better off have a relatively larger household size (10) than the middle (8) and the poor 
(7). This is mainly due to internal mobility of people – from poor to better-off households or 
relatives – to overcome household level food shortages, usually on permanent basis.  

                                                        
1 Kakeya are small fish that are obtained in the floodplain after the floods recede.

Important linkages between 
wealth groups or other population  
groups within the Zambezi West 
Bank Zone 
Important linkages between 
wealth groups from the affected 
area with populations in locations 
outside the Zambezi West Bank 
Zone 
Important market linkages with 
other locations 

The poor households sell their labour to the better off in exchange for food and cash.     They exchange their labour for the 
use of oxen to till their land from the better-off and middle-income households. 

Poor and middle income households in the West bank (especially western areas of Zambezi and Chavuma districts)  barter 
fish for maize and cassava with  households in the Zambezi East Bank (Eastern areas of Zambezi and Chavuma Districts).  

Fish and kakeya (small Fish) are exported from this zone to the Copperbelt and Lusaka especially during the main fishing 
period from March to August.  These are significant sources of income for all households in the livelihood zone.  Income 
from fish and kakeya increases when the volume of floods increases. Market accessibility becomes difficult as you move 
further away from the river. Road infrastructure is the most limiting factor for accessibility of both imports into and exports 
from the zone.  The Zambezi River is crossed by the pontoon or small boats.  Farmers use these to cross the river when 
they go to Zambezi or Chavuma town markets.   
Cattle, rice and forest products are also exported out of the zone.  The zone is a maize deficit zone, so maize and maize 
meal are amongst the most important imports.   

Other Linkages 

 
NORMAL AND CURRENT CONDITIONS SUMMARY SECTION: 

Labour migration outside the zone is not common. Occasional livestock sales to neighboring areas in Angola 

NOTE: This table roughly corresponds to the output from Steps 1 – 5 of the “Steps to Scenario Development.” It covers 
these 5 steps but includes only the initial responses (e.g., wealthier households respond by decreasing the wage rate for 
casual day labor, traders begin to source commodities in different locations).

Normal condition 

Current condition 

Northwestern areas are high annual rainfall areas 
(more than 1000mm), in the central parts (region II) 
it ranges between 800 – 1000mm (but soils are 
sandy) while the southern areas are drier (less than 
800 mm) and are considered marginal for maize 
production. Rainy season starts late October and 
ends in April. 
 

Above normal rains (above last 30 year average) 
received. Rains started timely, in most areas, 
temporal distribution was good, but southern half 
(Shangombo) experienced temporary dryness in 
February. Excessive rains received in March led to 
flooding and water logging along main rivers and the 
flood plains.  Floods were worsened due to heavy 
March rains upstream  (Zambezi) in Angola

Production 

Food crops 

The main food crops cultivated by all wealth groups 
are cassava, maize, rice and millet.  These crops are 
mainly grown for household consumption, while 
only a little is traded.  Due to the type of soils in the 
plain, only small quantities of sweet potatoes, 
groundnuts and beans are cultivated and these do not 
form a major source of food.  
** Updated 2007/08   data on crop production

Cash crop 

Rice is the main source of cash income from crops, 
while cassava is also becoming an important cash 
crop.

Livestock 

Livestock is kept mainly by the middle and better off 
households. These include cattle, goats and chickens. 
The poor typically have no livestock, at times not 
even chickens. CBPP is endemic in the area. Other

Fish sales – no noticeable change from normal; but 
with water receding likely to increase .  
At assessment time  there no noticeable change in 
fish catches (sales) levels due to high water levels. 
However, they are expected to increase as water 
recedes. 
No noticeable change; but likely to increase to

Barter/Purchase 

a significant source of income for the middle, while 
the better off also get some income from honey sales. 
Better off  (20% of hh in the livelihood zone ) get 
over 95%  of food from own crops, the middle (30% 
of HH in the zone ) get 60-70% aof food from own 
crops and the poor about (50% of HH in this zone ) 
get 45 -50% of their food from own production 
 
About  29% of households in the affected areas own 
food normally last up to 12 months (mostly the better 
off) 
 
About 37% of households in the affected  districts 
own food  normally last 4-6 months (Middle Group) 
 
About 26% of households in the affected  districts 
own food  normally last 7-9 months ( Middle 
income) 
 
About  9%  of households in the affected  districts 
own food  normally last 1-3 months (Mostly Poor 
household) 
 
 
 
Contributes between 10 -20% for all wealth groups 

Opportunities exist - especially for kakeya barter for 
cereals from the East Bank 

Labour exchange 

Contribute about 20% for the poor and about 10% 
for the middle Households 

In affected areas, opportunities will decrease, as 
cereal production is low (less available to exchange 
for labor) 

Other sources  

Wild foods are an important food source for the poor 
and middle while fish is equally as important for the 
poor. 

In general, likely to remain the same, contribution 
from fish may increase.

Sources of supply  These are normally deficit areas (subsistence 

Price behavior – 
food crops 

farming). Main sources of food are from neighboring  
communities/ districts   
Maize prices follow normal seasonal price trends ( 
low just after harvest (June –August) and at peak 
during the hunger season (February/March) 

Price behavior - 
livestock 

Livestock prices generally  stable  

Stocks (food 
crops) 

Market conduct 

Stocks last for 5-6 months for the poor, 8 months for 
the middle group and the whole consumption year 
for the better off. 
Government annual maize purchase by the FRA 
(June to September) 

the market within their communities 
Most food crops are sourced from outside each of 
these affected  districts  
 
Prices of cereal are higher than during reference 
year, in affected areas.  Maize prices in all districts 
except Zambezi and Chavuma were reported to be 
higher than last year (ranging from 50-71% above 
last year). Rice are higher everywhere except in 
Chavuma, while cassava were also higher in Lukhulu 
and Kalabo, did not change in Zambezi and 
Chavuma, while they dropped in Senanga.  Overall  
prices likely to rise earlier than normal.  If the 
sufficient grain moves from the  east bank or 
neighboring  districts into the affected west that may 
temper the  prices. 
Livestock prices are generally stable; cattle prices are 
up (range from 15-60% up) in Shangombo, Senanga, 
and Kalabo. Elsewhere no changes registered. For 
goats, prices are up in Shangombo, Senanga, 
Lukhulu and Kalabo (14-33%), no change in 
Zambezi, but are down in Chavuma? For poultry 
prices are up in all except Zambezi and Senanga 
where they remain unchanged. 
Current harvests will last shorter for affected areas 
for all wealth groups. SEE RESULTS 

Expected to run again this year esp. as national 
production is high.

National maize export ban likely to be lifted, could 
affect internal maize flows esp. to remote areas of 
the west bank 

Typical HH responses in an emergency include: 
-reducing household expenditures on non-essentials 
toward food;. 
-Unsustainable sale of livestock  
-Excessive exploitation of forest resources,  
-Collection of wild foods 
- Increased search for casual labour within the zone 
-Increased migration to fishing camps 
-Dependency on food aid 
 
 
-Distribution of food assistance 
-Increased input support for off-season production   ( 
winter production) 
 

Currently there are less coping strategies/ responses 
being employed as this are the harvest period. Most 
HH households in all six districts are having 2 meals 
a day (41-80%). Those with one meal range between 
(12-41%), the rest reported having three meals.  A 
few HH reported having to do additional casual labor 
to earn income for food 
 

Some HH reported to have received assistance in the 
past 6 months (about 10%).  

External response 

Market response  Market response is very weak as there is no incentive 

to trade also poor infrastructure discourages 
existence of more vibrant trading   

No noticeable differences from normal for this time 
of year

Program/ 
policy response 

Govt tends to ban exports when national crop 
production has been affected by hazards like floods 
and droughts 

No response yet, export ban is still on, but likely to 
be lifted because a national surplus is projected
