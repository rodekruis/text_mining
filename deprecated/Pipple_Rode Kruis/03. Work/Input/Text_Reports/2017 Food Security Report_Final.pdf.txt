1.  BACKGROUND 
 

1.1. Introduction 

 
The released 2017/2018 Crop Forecast estimates by the Ministry of Agriculture indicated that 
Zambia was poised to be food secure for that consumption season. Production figures showed 
that  the  country  produced  a  record  3,606,549  MT  of  maize  and  had  carryover  stock  of 
569,317MT  resulting  in  the  total  available  maize  for  the  2017/2018  marketing  season  of 
4,175,866 MT. This was an increase of 26 percent and 27 percent of the previous harvest and 
recent five – year average respectively. This record production was part of the concurrent seven 
– year production surplus that the country had enjoyed. Adding other cereals and tubers to the 
food basket raised the available maize equivalent stock to 5,440,415MT. In view of the fore – 
going, it was deduced that at the national level, Zambia was food secure.  
 
However, based on judgment  from  past  experience  there are pockets  of communities in  the 
country that are perpetually food insecure and in most years require some support. These areas 
mainly  lie  in  the  valley  areas  of  the  country  where  not  only  is  food  production  low  but, 
according to the demographic health survey, the disease burden of ailments such as malaria is 
also very high.  
 
Further,  a  combination  of  factors  working  together  with  low  crop  production  (i.e.,  poverty, 
disease and disaster vulnerability) have led to particularly negative food security  impacts in 
Zambia’s valley areas. Even with investment going towards building resilience in these areas, 
progress towards self – reliance has remained slow. 
 
While the available secondary data paint a clear picture of food security conditions in Zambia, 
concerted programming efforts are on - going in the country, and there are opportunities for 
additional,  complementary  interventions,  including  those  of  future  food  aid  programmes,  to 
meaningfully address proximate and underlying causes of food insecurity in the country and to 
improve the lives and livelihoods of food insecure Zambians, as well as those most at risk of 
food insecurity.  
 
The  2017  Food  Security  and  Livelihoods  Assessment  therefore  was  designed  to  answer  to 
chronic situations in the country and recommend the possible solutions for risk reduction and 
resilience building both  for the short and long term in  addition  to support for required food 
where necessary. 
 

1.2. Purpose and Objectives 

 
The purpose of this prospective Food Security and Livelihoods Assessment  was to describe 
and analyse current and projected food security outcomes in the chronic food insecure areas of 
the country. In addition, the outcome of the assessment was tailored to provide Government 
and its partners adequate information for basing decisions on onwards planning and possible 
response in  cases where the situation warrants.  The data and information  in  the report were 
also  meant  to  assist  potential  future  initiatives  in  designing  and  identifying  areas  where 
resilience building could be directed. In the immediate, the information obtained will help in 
understanding the dynamics in these communities and more importantly assist in designing a 
monitoring mechanism for observing the unfolding food security situation in those areas.

2.  CONTEXT 
 

2.1. Economic Performance 

 
Zambia has had one of the world’s fastest growing economies for the past ten years, with real 
GDP growth averaging roughly 6.7 percent per annum which in the last five years has slowed 
down  to  4.7  percent.  Zambia’s  economy  came  under  strain  in  2015  and  2016  as  external 
headwinds  and  domestic  pressure  intensified.  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  grew  at  2.8 
percent in 2015 and 3.3 percent in 2016, much slower than the average 7.4 percent between 
2004 and 2014. The external headwinds included slower regional and global growth and lower 
global copper prices. Domestic pressures included power outages that intensified from mid-
2015 to the end of 2016, impacting all sectors of the economy. 
 
As well as this, repeat fiscal deficits have weighed on investor confidence, and low and poorly 
– timed rains led to reduced agricultural income for the poorest Zambians and increased food 
prices in 2015. Economic conditions have improved slightly since the turn of 2017, and the 
World Bank projects an improved growth rate of 4 percent in 2017. This follows high rainfall 
in  the  2016/17  agricultural  season  that  has  improved  agricultural  output  and  quickened  the 
replenishment of hydro-electric reservoirs. 
 
Meanwhile, the Government of Zambia has approved its 7th National Development Plan 2017–
2021 and has launched it. The plan, "Accelerating Development Efforts Towards Vision 2030 
Without Leaving Anyone Behind,” calls for a fundamental shift in the way resources are being 
allocated, taking into account global and regional trends. The strategic goal of the 7th National 
Development  Plan is  to create a diversified  and resilient economy  for sustained growth and 
social economic development. It will also include a result-oriented performance management 
system to be used to measure progress of its implementation. 
 

2.2.Food Availability and Access 

 

2.2.1.  Crop Production 

 
Zambia depends on maize for its staple food whilst cassava, millet and sorghum contribute to 
the food basket in varying proportions primarily in rural communities. For the past ten years, 
the cereal production trend has been increasing and the country has recorded surplus harvests 
making  it  a  net  exporter  of  maize  to  countries  like  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo, 
Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Malawi. 
 
According to  the 2016/17 Crop Forecast  Survey, Maize production increased by 26 percent 
from 2,873,052 metric tonnes in the 2015/2016 season to 3,606,549 metric tonnes. The national 
average  yield  rate  for  maize  increased  slightly  to  2.19  metric  tonnes  per  hectare  from  2.10 
metric tonnes per hectare last season which represents an increase of 4 percent. Area harvested 
also  increased  by  24  percent  to  1,433,944  hectares  from  1,157,755  hectares  in  2015/2016 
agriculture season. The contributing factors to the high production of maize are increased area 
planted,  favourable  agro  meteorological  conditions  and  favourable  price  expectations  by 
farmers  that  sold  their  maize  to  FRA  in  the  previous  market  season.  In  addition,  usage  of 
fertilizer on maize by farmers increased by 26 percent in 2016/2017 compared to last season.   
 
Cassava production also increased with cassava flour equivalent production for the 2016/2017 
season recording an increase by 8 percent to 923,795 metric tonnes compared to 854,393 metric 

 

3 

tonnes produced during  the last season. Area under Cassava  equally increased by 8 percent 
from 292,100 ha in the 2015/2016 season to 315,827 ha in the 2016/2017.  
 
Production of sorghum increased by 23 percent to 17,337 metric tonnes from 14,107 metric 
tons last season. Similarly, millet production increased by 9 percent to 32,566 metric tonnes 
from  29,973  metric  tonnes  last  season.  Rice  production  increased  by  44  percent  to  38,423 
metric tonnes from 26,675 metric tonnes last season.  
 

2.2.2.  National Food Supply for the 2017/18 Marketing Season 

 

At national level, the country has produced sufficient maize for both human consumption and 
industrial  use  to  last  up  to  next  harvest  while  some  households  in  chronic  food  deficit 
communities may face moderate food insecurity due low production but may still access the 
commodity  from  surplus  regions.  The  total  maize  production  for  the  2016/2017  agriculture 
season  is  estimated  at  3,606,549  metric  tonnes.  When  the  maize  carryover  stocks  from  last 
season is added to this year’s production, the total supply of maize available for the 2017/2018 
marketing season is 4,175,866 metric tonnes. For the current population, the food balance sheet 
shows  that  the  total  maize  required  for  human  consumption,  industrial  use  and  other 
commitments that includes an anticipated National Strategic Reserve stock of 500,000 metric 
tonnes by the Food Reserve Agency (FRA) amount to 2,997,350 metric tonnes. When the total 
maize  requirements  are  subtracted  from  total  availability,  the  Food  Balance  Sheet  (FBS) 
indicates that the country  has recorded  a maize  surplus of 1,178,516 metric tonnes. See the 
FBS below.

2.2.3.  Livestock Performance 

The performance of the livestock sector in Zambia has continued to show positive growth and 
outlook. In 2016 livestock population increased with strong performance being recorded in the 
pigs,  poultry  and  goats  sub  sectors  representing  growth  of  42  percent,  22percent  and  17.8 
percent respectively.   Cattle population also recorded a positive growth of 7.8 percent while 
sheep  stood  at  13.8  percent.  There  was  a  general  increase  in  the  population  of  all  types  of 
livestock (cattle, pork, poultry, goat, and sheep). Table 1 below shows the livestock populations 
of the above mentioned livestock species for the year 2016 relative to 2015. Although livestock 
population statistics have not yet been updated, the trend indicates a positive trajectory.

The growth in the livestock sector is attributed to increased investment in production extension, 
disease control and prevention by the Government and private sector as well as strong domestic 
and regional demand for livestock and its products such as beef, pork, poultry, goats, eggs and 
milk. Production and Consumption of livestock and poultry products continued on an upward 
trend  as  demand  continues  to  increase.    Table  3  below  shows  the  production  of  livestock 
products by the end of 2016.

Livestock is  a major source of  food and income  and its production  continues to  be a major 
livelihood  activity  among  small  scale  farmers  in  the  country.  Small  livestock  and  poultry 
constitute the most  liquid assets among resource poor farming rural  households.  In difficult 
times, these households rely on income from sales to pay for requisites such as school fees, 
health care, purchase of food and non-food items and is also a form of insurance against shocks. 
 
According to statistics from Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, production of major livestock 
is  concentrated in  four provinces of Southern, Western, Central  and Eastern Provinces  with 
cattle  contributing  at  least  55  percent  share  of  major  livestock  in  Zambia.  The  other  major 
livestock include goats (35 percent) and pigs (10 percent). Likewise, poultry continues to play 
a major role as a source of income and food with most households rearing it. 
 
However, in the past, cattle production was severely disrupted by recurring disease outbreaks 
which  have  decimated  the  stocks.  The  common  diseases  included  Foot  and  Mouth  Disease 
(FMD), East Coast Fever and Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP). It is worth noting 
that most of the areas affected by these diseases  are also  prone to  drought  and occasionally 
flood occurrences.  
 
In  order  to  control  livestock  diseases,  Government  has  rolled  out  vaccination  campaign 
targeting  600,000  cattle  against  Foot  and  Mouth  Disease  in  Central,  Southern  and  Western 
Provinces.  A total of 584,024 cattle were vaccinated by the end of December 2016 and the 
vaccinations have continued into 2017 to meet the planned target. Further the Ministry planned 
to vaccinate 350,000 cattle against Contagious Bovine Pleural Pneumonia (CBPP) in Western 
Province.    293,000  cattle  were  vaccinated  by  December  2016.  During  the  same  period  the 
Ministry immunized 37,486 calves against east coast fever in Eastern and Southern Provinces 
and this activity is on- going to cover the planned 80,000 calves.  
 

2.2.4.  Fisheries 

 
Fish contribute a significant amount of animal protein to the diets of people, is highly nutritious, 
serves as a valuable supplement in diets lacking essential vitamins and minerals, harvested by 
artisanal and is a source of work and income for many people countrywide. If well harnessed 
Fisheries can be a significant export commodity with potential for increased foreign exchange 
earnings for the country. 
 
Government  has  therefore  prioritised  aquaculture  and  improvement  of  infrastructure  for 
fisheries research and marketing as well as promoting co-management of capture fisheries in 

 

6 

natural  water  bodies  to  ensure  sustainability  of  fisheries  resources.  Table  4  below  shows

3.  ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY  
 
The  Assessment  was  based  on  participatory  methods  of  data  collection  and  was  conducted  in  four 
phases namely: 

i. 

ii. 
iii. 
iv. 

Selection  of  Districts  –  this  was  based  mainly  on  production  of  maize  compared  with 
production of the district in the last ten years; 
Problem Analysis 
Design of the Needs and Response Framework; and  
Compilation of Reports and development of monitoring mechanism. 

 

3.1. Selection of Districts 

 
The  selection  of  districts  to  be  assessed  involved  analysis  of  indicators  pertaining  to  availability  and 
access  to  food  in  the  districts  that  are  traditionally  food  insecure.  Historical  data  from  the  ZVAC 
Assessments for a ten-year period was also used in identifying the chronically food insecure areas. Based 
on these indicators, the following districts were selected:

3.2. Problem Analysis 

 
During this phase, the ZVAC determined the immediate, underlying and root causes of chronic 
food  insecurity.  The  gist  of  this  was  to  help  pin-point  the  nature  of  the  problem,  the  likely 
populations suffering from it and what the possible solutions could be. This phase also help in 
the design of the monitoring framework that will be used to look at the evolving food security 
situation situation for such communities.

3.3.Features of the Assessment 

 
 The following were the key features of the assessment: 
 

3.3.1.  Desk Top Analysis  

 
The Assessment started by gathering the necessary secondary data pertaining to livelihoods, 
availability,  access,  utilization  as  well  as  coping  mechanisms  in  the  selected  districts.  Gaps 
were then be identified and these gaps were then filled by using information collected from the 
field. 
 

3.3.2.  Assessment Methods to be Used 

 
The Assessment was mainly based on participatory methods such as Key Informant Interviews 
at the district level, Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) at the Community level and Household 
interviews at the household level. 
 

3.3.3.  Sample Selection 

 
The selection of the sample was purposive and owing to this, profiles of each identified district 
identified  were  created  with  no  generalization  to  the  entire  selected  districts.  In  order  to 
understand  the  behaviour  of  the  selected  indicators,  it  was  agreed  that  the  entry  point  is  to 
organise  a  district  level  key  informant  interview  before  going  to  assess  the  communities  in 
question. After this was done, three communities were then selected in each district in order to 
get the required information and understand the nature and severity of food insecurity in the 
selected  districts.  At  the  community  level,  five  (5)  households  were  also  selected  and 
interviewed in order to get an understanding of the household level parameters. 
 

3.3.4.  Selection of Enumerators 

 
Enumerators  that  collected  and  analysed  data  from  this  Assessment  were  food  security 
practitioners from the partner institutions, the Government, UN and Non State Actors.

4.  FINDINGS 
 

4.1. Basic Characteristics 

 
The Assessment  revealed that the  households  in  the assessed  districts  consist  on average of 
seven (7) members. Access to infrastructure and basic services is also problematic for many 
rural households in the assessed districts. The Assessed households mostly resided in areas that 
are  isolated  from  population  centres  and  markets.  These  areas  did  not  also  have  proper 
connectivity  in  terms  of  road  infrastructure  and  communication  which  impeded  economic 
participation of these areas of the country.  
 

4.2. Risk Analysis 

 

4.2.1.  Rainfall Performance 

 
During  the  2013/  2014  rainy  season,  Zambia  experienced  hydro-  meteorological  hazards  of 
floods,  drought,  human  and  livestock  diseases.  Contrary  to  the  projection  by  the  Southern 
African  Climate  Outlook  Forum  and  the  Zambia  Meteorological  Department  that  Zambia 
would  experience  normal  to  above  normal,  the  2014/  2015  rainfall  performance  was 
characterized with an early on-set of rainfall confined to the Northern, Luapula, and some parts 
of North Western and Western Provinces while the Southern half of the country received below 
normal rainfall due to the El Nino conditions that prevailed over the region. The 2014/ 2015 
and  2015/  2016  El  Nino  conditions  impacted  negatively  on  the  energy  sector,  water  and 
agriculture  and  food  security.  The  2015/  2016  rainy  season  was  a  repeat  of  the  2014/  2015 
which  recorded  normal  to  below  normal  rainfall  except  for  the  North-  Eastern  parts  of  the 
country which experienced normal rainfall. The 2016/ 2017 rainfall performance was a shift 
from  the  previous  past  two  rainy  seasons.  The  2016/  2017  rainy  season  received  normal  to 
above normal rainfall with flash flood occurrences which was mainly attributed to the La Niña 
phenomena over the Equatorial Pacific Ocean (Refer to figure 2).  
 
During the period under review, most of the parts of the country recorded a very good rainfall 
performance  both  in  amount  and  distribution  with  all  provinces  receiving  normal  to  above 
normal rainfall amounts compared to the two previous El Nino events (2014/2015 and 2015/ 
2016 rainy seasons) resulting into the following: 

•  Thunderstorms causing associated with strong winds leading to infrastructure damage; 
•  Outbreaks of pests - army worms, stalk borer and ref locusts; and 
•  Outbreaks of diarrhoea diseases. 

 
In term of cumulative rainfall, North Western Province recorded the highest amount of rainfall 
at  1500mm  and  Southern  at  Kafue  polder  recorded  as  low  as  734  mm.  The  rainy  season 
recorded  flash  floods  across  the  country  with  Lusaka  Province  having  more  pronounced 
occurrences.  The  season  also  experienced  outbreaks  of  pest  infestations  due  to  sharp 
temperature  gradients.  The  season  also  recorded  Tropical  Cyclone,  Dineo  by  mid-February 
2017,  which  hit  the  Mozambique  Channel,  intensifying  rainfall  activities  over  much  of 
Southern Africa region, including Zambia.

4.2.2.  Hazard Analysis  

 
The  Assessed  districts  were  ravaged  by  various  hazards  namely  floods,  droughts,  pest 
infestation,  livestock  diseases,  human  epidemics,  human  –  animal  conflicts  and  high  food 
prices. Figure below shows the levels of these hazards in the survey areas.

The mixed El Nino and La Nina events experienced from 2013 triggered a number of hazards 
which  had  varying  effects  on  different  wealth  groups  in  the  assessed  districts.  The  major 
hazards that affected the households in the Zambezi and Luangwa valleys in the last five years 
included  pest  infestation  (14.3  percent),  droughts  (14  percent),  floods  (11.6  percent)  and 
livestock diseases (10.8 percent). In terms of the impact of the hazards across the wealth groups, 
majority  of  the  households  (55  percent)  indicated  that  they  were  severely  impacted  by  the 
hazards, 13.5 percent of the households indicated that the impact of the hazard was moderate 
and 3.4 percent experienced low impact. 
 

4.2.3.  Vulnerability Analysis 

 
The survey indicated that 34 percent of the better- off households indicated that they had fully 
recovered compared to the poor (15.6 percent) and very poor (22.2 percent). The figure below 
further shows that 7.4 percent of the very poor households had partially recovered compared 
to 34.3 percent of the better- off. The table below shows that the capacity for recovery was 
directly proportion to the wealth grouping and the better- Off had were more resilient to the 
hazards  than  other  wealth  groups.  The  survey  also  revealed  that  the  Better-off  were  less 
vulnerable to floods, droughts and Pest infestation due to diverse livelihoods they are engaged 
in than other wealth groups.

4.2.4.  Early Warning 

 
According to Assessment results, 87 percent of the people were warned of impending hazards 
in their areas where they reside. This shows an increasing trend in the number of people warned. 
The  number  of  people  warned  increased  by  16  percent  from  the  2016  figure.  The  mode  of 
delivery for these warnings included radio accounting for 40 percent followed by television at 
13 percent.  The other modes such as flyers and newspapers only accounted for 6 percent. The 
respondents interviewed indicated that the District Disaster Management Committee were the 
main  sources  of  warnings  (32  percent).  The  other  sources  of  information  included  Zambia 
Meteorological Department (18 percent) and ZESCO (11 percent). 
 

4.3.Livelihood Analysis 

 

4.3.1.  Livelihood Sources 

 
Households  in  the  sampled  districts  engage  in  a  variety  of  farm  and  non-farm  activities. 
Agricultural activities combined (crop, livestock, and agricultural wage labour) amount to 60 
percent  of  total  income  for  rural  households,  a  figure  that  is  driven  mostly  by  independent 
agricultural  work.  Breaking  down  the  agricultural  activities  in  the  assessed  communities 
indicated that 24 percent were involved in crop production, 18 percent in livestock production, 
a  further  18  percent  in  agriculture  labour,  8  percent  in  fishing  and  6  percent  in  trading. 
Participation  in  non-agricultural  self-employment  is  similar  to  that  of  other  developing 
countries (Davis et al., 2010), with 40 percent of rural households engaged in these activities.

Type of Livelihoods

 

 
It  is  expected  that  activities  pertaining  to  the  top  three  livelihoods  namely  crop 
production/sales,  livestock  production  and  provision  of  casual  labour  will  provide 
opportunities for households in the assessed districts at the local level. For some districts in 
border areas, the traditional migration to other areas is expected to marginally reduce as most 
households may opt to strengthen their production base in readiness for next season in view of 
a good harvest. It is also expected that the quality of their livestock will significantly improve 
in  view  of  good  grassland  and  abundance  of  water  thereby  affording  them  good  earning 
potential from this sub – sector. 
 

4.4. Income Sources 

 
The Assessment showed that the common income sources included crop sales (44.1 percent), 
agricultural wage labour (20 percent), livestock production (15.1 percent), fishing (6.9 percent) 
and gardening (2.8 percent). Minor livelihoods included petty trading (2.1 percent), remittances 
(1.7 percent), formal employment (1.4 percent) and brewing (1.4 percent).

Income Source

 

 
It is clear that majority of the key livelihoods that are undertaken in the assessed districts mainly 
lie in the agricultural sector and are seasonal. However, with a good harvest in some of the 
districts, it is anticipated that both the agricultural and non – agricultural employment activities 
will be available owing to the fact that these agricultural households may invest some of their 
income from increased production in other aspects such as housing, storage and the like where 
the poor may find opportunities. The assessment reported that these opportunities may arise 
from July to September. In terms of earnings from such activities, the assessment indicated that 
these  are  likely  to  marginally  increase  owing  to  the  fact  that  economic  performance  in  the 
country has slackened. 
 

4.5. Expenditure  

 
Expenditure share is key in determining the economic vulnerability of households and population 
in general. From the data collected, the discussion will be limited to expenditure share on food to 
ascertain to what extent people in the assessed districts created a balance between food and non-
food items in view of the negative impacts brought about by the shocks in the last three seasons. 
The expenditure share analysis in this Report was based on both purchases and own production 
estimates with a standard recall period of thirty (30) days. 
 
Analysis on expenditure showed that more than 64 percent of the households in the assessed 
districts  spent  less  than  fifty  percent  of  their  earnings  on  food.  A  further  15  percent  of  the 
households in the assessed districts spent between 50 and 65 percent while another 14 percent 
spent  between  65  and  75  percent.  Only  about  7  percent  of  the  households  in  the  assessed 
districts spent more than 75 percent of their earnings on food (see figure 7 below).

Further analysis of expenditure on food by wealth group indicated that only the poor and very 
poor had expenditure that were in excess of 75 percent of their total expenditure. On the other 
hand,  majority  on  the  better  –  off  and  the  middle  spend  less  than  65  percent  of  their  total 
expenditure.

4.6.Agriculture and Food Security 

 
The survey results indicate that the main staple food is maize with a percentage share of 78 
percent,  sorghum  12  percent  while  millet  and  sorghum  represent  5  percent.  This  finding  is 
consistent with agro-climatic conditions in the assessed districts. Furthermore, even though the 
sorghum  and  millet  would  do  well  in  the  assessed  districts  it  was  apparent  that  the  heavy 
promotion of maize and programmes promoting its cultivation such as the FISP and FSP have 
contributed to the abandonment of other crops, which apparently were the staple for some of 
these communities.

Further, 86 percent of households depend on own production farming activities as their main 
source of staple food. The survey showed that the production of all the major staple food crops 
such as maize, sorghum, millet, rice and cassava generally continued to expand in most of these 
districts. Other sources of food purchases, wild  foods and barter and labour representing 10 
percent and 2 percent each respectively as seen in figure 10 below.

Communities and households in the assessed districts normally experience food scarcity during 
the year and usually main staple food from own production only last 7 months in a good year. 
Figure 11 below shows the percentage of communities that experience food scarcity at some 
point in a normal year. 
 
Figure 11: Experience of Food Scacity at Selected Point in a Year 

 

 
From  the  above  chart,  it  can  be  seen  that  about  81  percent  of  the  communities  interviewed 
reported to experience food shortages at some period in the year. A further analysis in the chat 
below reveals that most communities experience food shortages as early as October. It can be 
noticed  that  in  most  communities,  food  supplies  are  usually  available  in  high  and  medium 
quantities in four months i.e May, June, July and August while they are low in Septembet to 
October.  
 
Despite the country producing a record harvest this year, the assessment findings indicate that 
the  staple  food  from  own  production  in  the  chronic  food  insecure  areas  will  last  only  five 
months up to October.

4.7. Food Consumption Score 

 
The Assessment showed that most of the people in the assessed districts have acceptable food 
consumption scores (56.8 percent) followed by those with borderline food consumption scores 
(18.4 percent). Although the survey showed that majority of the households had good dietary 
diversity in the form of consumption scores, there were still 24.8 percent of households which 
had poor dietary diversity.  The good dietary diversity emanated from the fact that communities 
had increased access and consumption of diverse own produced foods.  
 
At  the  districts  level,  the  results  showed  that  the  poor  and  very  poor  in  nine  of  the  sixteen 
assessed districts had poor consumption scores. These districts included Chirundu, Luangwa, 
Mambwe, Sioma, Shang’ombo, Sesheke, Siavonga, Gwembe and Nyimba (See Annex I). 
 

4.8. Cereal Crops Performance 

 
The assessment results have shown that most districts recorded increments in maize production 
compared to the five-year average as shown in the table in table 7 below. However, Luangwa 
and  Zambezi  recorded  decreases  of  36  and  15  percent  respectively.  Nyimba,  Mambwe  and 
Chama recorded higher production translating into 41, 42 and 46 percent respectively as seen 
in table 7 below. Chavuma, Sinazongwe and Petauke districts recorded a minimal increase in 
production.

The unsatisfactory performance in  Luangwa,  Zambezi,  Chavuma, Sinazongwe, Petauke  and 
Siavonga can be attributed to floods, human animal conflict and late delivery of inputs under 
FISP. Despite low and negative crop harvest performance in some communities in chronic food 
insecurity districts,  the country has more than enough stocks that can be distributed to  food 
deficit areas and improve food supply and availability in these areas.

4.9. Food Prices and Access 

 
Staple  food  prices  have  remained  stable  and  with  marginal  reductions  being  experienced 
compared to the same period last marketing season despite the new crop harvest reaching the 
market.  The price of maize grain which were high during the 2016/17 marketing season varies 
depending on the region but range from ZMW 50 to ZMW 80 across the country.

Maize grain

Breakfast Mealie Meal

Roller Mealie Meal

 

 
Due to new bumper crop harvest, maize grain, breakfast mealie meal and roller meal prices 
that reached their peak in February and March 2017 started reducing by April and May. This 
trend is expected to continue up and until October when upward movement is anticipated. 
 

4.9.1.  Food Markets 

 
The  staple  food  will  be  readily  available  on  the  market  throughout  the  year  up  to  the  new 
harvest in April 2018 owing to the record harvest and improved availability coupled with huge 
carryover stocks.  However, only communities that experience chronic food insecurity may run 
out  of  own  stock  staple  food  supply  during  the  lean  period  (November  to  February)  as  the 
commodity normally become scarce. In most parts of the country, supply of the staple food is 
expected to be high to medium from July to October while supply will be  low but stable up to 
March in 2018. The prices of staple food are normally high during the lean period and low after 
the harvest month of May and June. Apart from maize other staple foods, that is, cassava, millet 
and sorghum that are normally used for nshima are available after the harvest.  
 
Among the communities interviewed, the results have revealed that high prices are prominent 
from October to January while the lowest prices are recorded from April to July. These price 
changes coincide with the periods of food availability and scarcity which is usually a seasonal 
phenomenon. The figure below shows the monthly prices for the main staple food are high and 
when they are low.

The number of sellers will also exhibit the same pattern unless the FRA enters the market and 
mops excess maize on the market thereby crowding out private sector participation and free 
market purchases and exchange.  
 
Poor households in food deficit communities, will later in the season, depend on the market, 
and, at that point, will face higher prices and difficulties meeting their food needs. The lifting 
of the maize export ban may help maintain relatively high prices for farmers storing the maize 
to sell later in the season. In the communities visited; it’s evident that stable food supply in 
markets lasts for an average of 5 months from the month of May to September. The rest of the 
period is  characterised  with  erratic  food supply  as most of the food  commodities from  own 
production would have diminished. Poor road infrastructure in most of the communities visited 
also contributes to scarcity and limited supply of staple food on the market. The figure below 
shows the levels of maize grain availability on the market during the calendar year.

4.10 Livestock 
 
Zambia  is  endowed  with  a  vast  resource  base  for  production.  Livestock  production  and 
associated products offer significant opportunities for economic growth which ultimately helps 
reduce poverty. especially among the rural farmers where the resource base is not fully utilised 
as manifested by low livestock productivity.

Results in table 8 indicate marginal differences in prices among all livestock types. The results 
also show that livestock price remained stable from November in 2016 to May 2017 when the 
assessment  was  conducted.  Prices  for  cattle  remained  the  same  while  generally  prices  were 
higher on the survey date which was in May compared to prices in November 2016 for goats, 
pigs and chickens.  This pattern could be due to the fact that during the period from November 
2016  to  March  2017,  staple  food  availability  is  low  and  sometimes  scarce  hence  farmers’ 
propensity to sell their small livestock in order to generate income to buy food. At the beginning 

 

22 

of  the  marketing  year,  livestock  prices  were  relatively  high  because  households  were  not 
compelled to sell as they have food around this time.  
 
Livestock Diseases  
 
Communities pointed out Lumpy skin disease, black leg, foot and mouth and CBBP as the most 
common diseases in cattle. The most common disease in goats is mange while swine fever and 
new castle are the most common diseases in pigs and poultry respectively.  
 
4.11 Coping Strategies 
 
The  Coping  Strategies  Index  (CSI)  is  one  of  the  indicators  and  tools  for  measuring  food 
insecurity or impact of a hazard on food security.  Watts (1983) demonstrated modest dietary 
adjustments  (eating  less-preferred  foods  or  reducing  portion  size)  are  easily  reversible 
strategies  that  do  not  jeopardize  longer-term  prospects.  More  extreme  behaviours  (sale  of 
productive assets) suggest more serious long-term consequences.  
 
According to assessment results, when households and communities run out of own produced 
staple food, 79 percent reported to be engaged in unusual coping strategies while 21 percent 
did not. This result indicates the majority of households in the assessed districts during the year 
often experience food insecurity and resort to other sources of food to meet their food needs.

According to the assessment findings, two main copying strategies employed by the majority 
of  households  included  collecting  of  wild  food  (fruits  and  tubers)  which  accounted  for  83 
percent with 17 percent engaged in the sale of household assets.

Further,  it  was  also  observed  that  communities  in  Zambezi  (67  percent)  and  Siavonga  (50 
percent),  accounted  for  the  highest  proportion  communities  that  engaged  in  the  sale  of 
household assets.

These findings may also indicate that as food insecurity worsens, households are more likely 
to  employ  strategies  that  are  less  reversible,  and  therefore  represent  a  more  severe  form  of 
coping and greater food insecurity.

4.12.  Human Health and Nutrition 
 
The  outcome  of  the  assessment  for  health  and  nutrition  will  provide  government  and  its 
partners adequate information for basing decisions on onwards planning and possible response 
in cases where the situation warrants. The data and information in the report, including areas 
particularly  vulnerable  to  high  disease  burden,  are  also  meant  to  assist  potential  future 
initiatives  in  designing  and  identifying  areas  where  resilience  building  as  well  as 
implementation  of health interventions could  be directed.  In the immediate, the information 
obtained will help in understanding the dynamics in these communities and more importantly 
assist in designing a monitoring mechanism for observing the unfolding health and nutrition 
situation in those areas. 
 
Findings  on  several  areas  of  importance  from  the  selected  districts  relating  to  health  and 
nutrition are indicated below and include percentage increases on Malaria (in both under-fives 
and pregnant women), Diarrhoea (Blood and non-blood), Cough / Acute Respiratory Infections 
(ARI),  Measles  and  HIV  /  AIDS  in  the  period  under  review  prior  to  the  conducting  of  the 
assessment. 
 
From the sampled districts, the following were the increases in terms of percentage focusing 
on the selected disease distribution and burden. The two periods of consideration are the 1st 
quarter of 2016 and the 1st quarter of 2017.

Malaria 
 
High prevalence of malaria cases were observed in under 5 children and pregnant women and 
this could have been attributed to the following: 

•  No household possession of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets ( LLITN)  
•  Non-use of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) by persons 
•  Non implementation of the Indoor Residual Spray activity against mosquitoes (IRS). 
•  Failure to access Intermittent Preventive Treatment by pregnant women (IPTs) 
•  Poor implementation of integrated vector management practices (IVM). 
•  Favourable climatic conditions for mosquito infestation being in the valley areas. 

 
Diarrhoea (Blood & Non – Blood) 
 
There  was  an  increase  in  the  incidence  rate  of  non-bloody  diarrhoea  compared  to  bloody 
diarrhoea and this could have largely been attributed to the following among others, 

•  Poor Hygiene practises i.e. (Hand washing with soap /Ash) 
•  Highly compromised sanitation situations (Open Defecation) 
•  Non availability of toilet facilities. 
• 
•  Non availability of household water treatment supplies i.e. Chlorine. 
•  Poor feeding habits. 
•  Low economic status 

Inadequate supply of safe water. 

 
ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS (ARI) 
 
Coughs  /ARI  are  leading  cause  of  childhood  morbidity  and  mortality  especially  in  children 
who are between 2-5yrs old. From the assessment, high prevalence rates of ARI recorded could 
be as a result of deficiencies as to the way mothers and other care givers conduct home-care. 
 
 It’s  a  well-known  fact  that,  early  diagnosis  and  treatment  with  antibiotics  can  reduce  the 
mortality and morbidity statistics. Therefore, mothers and care givers in identifying the need 
for home care, (in case of a cough or cold) should carefully observe symptoms that don’t result 
into pneumonia and get to a health facility in the case were its severe pneumonia. 
 
Skilled  health  workers  will  assess  to  determine  what  category  the  patient  is  in  e.g.  severe 
pneumonia, very severe pneumonia, pneumonia or no pneumonia and recommend appropriate 
mode of care. 
 
Measles 
 
Measles  remains  one  of  the  leading  causes  of  death  among  small  children  despite  the 
availability  of  safe  and  effective  vaccines.  From  the  assessment,  most  districts  from  the 
sampled areas could have implemented accelerated immunization activities. 
 
 Few  districts  indicated  a  slight  increase  in  the  disease  burden  though  the  prevalence  was 
relatively low. And in populations with high levels of malnutrition and a lack of adequate health 
care, measles cases result into death. 
 
 

 

26 

HIV Infections 
 
From the assessment, there was a significant rise of incidence cases across districts which 
could have resulted from the following among others; 

•  Lack of individual knowledge of HIV transmission;  
•  Non adoption of safer sexual practises; and 
•  Lack of information on antiretroviral drugs. 

 
Nutrition 
 
Adequate  nutrition  is  critical  to  children  growth  and  development.  The  period  from  birth  is 
especially  important  for  optimal,  physical,  mental,  cognitive  and  health  development. 
Unfortunately,  this  period  is  often  marked  by  macro-  and  micronutrient  deficiencies  that 
interfere with optimal growth where we see childhood illnesses come in i.e. diarrhoea, measles, 
and acute respiratory infections. 
 
Wasting 
 
From the assessment report, of the districts sampled, Nyimba had the highest number in terms 
of prevalence of wasting followed by Shang’ombo, Petauke and Chama The other districts that 
indicated  increased  outcome  had  relatively  average  to  low  statistics  in  as  far  as  wasting  is 
concerned which critically looks at the low weight for height balance.

Underweight 
 
This indicator focused on children whose body weight was considered too low to be healthy. 
From the assessment, Sinazongwe, Sesheke, Shang’ombo, Chirundu and Chama Districts had 
high prevalence figures in terms of underweight which largely focused on low weight for age.

Chronic Malnutrition 
 
This is another form of growth failure which is also referred to as stunting. And a child that is 
chronically malnourished often appears to be normally proportioned but actually shorter than 
normal for his/her age. Sesheke, Mulobezi and Shang’ombo and Chama had high prevalence 
rate.

The above noted nutritional statistics could have been attributed to the following; 

 

•  Shortfall of adequately qualified nutritionists and dieticians 
•  Non implementations of IYCF and IMCI programs which would look at the 

following; 
o  Exclusive breastfeeding of infants below 6 months. 
o  Early initiation of breast feeding (within the first hour of birth). 
o  Adequate feeding practises, and continued breast feeding. 
o  Acute shortage of food.

4.13.  WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE (WASH) 
 
Water  and  Sanitation  is  a  key  component  of  all  aspects  of  sustainable  development.  The 
country’s  vision  for  water  as  reflected  in  the  Seventh  National  Development  Plan  (SNDP, 
2017-2022) is to ensure that all Zambians access safe water and sanitation as well as efficient 
and sustainable utilization for wealth creation and betterment of livelihoods by 2030. 
 
Water  Resources  Development  and  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  including  Environmental 
issues  are  now  being  managed  by  the  new  Ministry  of  Water  Development,  Sanitation  and 
Environmental Protection while the Water Supply and Sanitation in the urban and peri-urban 
areas is implemented by the established commercial utilities and the Local Authorities in rural 
areas under the Ministry of Local Government (MLG). The sector has prioritized investment 
in  infrastructure  development  in  rural  areas  in  order  to  improve  the  livelihood  of  the  rural 
population where the majority of the poor live. 
 
Access to water and sanitation services by all segments of the population is a key component 
of all aspects of sustainable development and this challenge becomes more important when the 
population  growth  by  2030  is  factored  in.  All  sectors  require  access  to  adequate  water  and 
sanitation services for their productivity to be enhanced. In 2015, only 40 percent of households 
in Zambia had access to improved sources of sanitation. Additionally, 27 percent of people in 
urban areas and 85 percent in rural areas had no access to improved sources of sanitation. The 
proportion  of  households  accessing  improved  sources  of  drinking  water  increased  from  63 
percent  in  2010  to  67.7  percent  in  2015.  Households  in  urban  areas  had  more  access  to 
improved sources of drinking water at 89.2 percent compared to 51.6 percent of households in 
rural areas in 2015.  
 
Effective and sustainable management of clean, safe water and sanitation is key to improved 
health for all. Poor water supply and sanitation conditions are major contributors to the burden 
of disease and expose people to water-borne diseases and related ailments. There is need to 
increase levels of access to clean and safe water and sanitation services for people in rural and 
urban areas. To achieve this, strategies to facilitate water and sanitation services provision and 
prioritise the utilisation of clean and safe water among households will be intensified.  
 
Further, solid waste that is disposed of at undesignated places poses various health risks to the 
affected communities. According to the World Health Organisation, inappropriate disposal of 
waste poses the most significant environmental health problems that threaten human health in 
Africa. This is because poorly managed waste is one of the major breeding grounds for flies 
and rodents, while burning of waste produces toxic fumes. These can in turn result in health 
conditions, such as diarrhoea, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections and skin diseases. 
 
Strategies  will  be  undertaken  during  the  Plan  period  to  address  water  supply  and  sanitation 
challenges with a view to improving the living conditions of citizens. Water conservation and 
water-related disaster management coordination will also be incorporated in all strategies to 
mitigate effects of climate change and variability.  
 
Water Sources 
 
The assessment revealed that household access to total safe water or improved water supply by 
main sources was only at 36 percent of which 31 percent was boreholes and 5 percent protected 
wells. The household access to total unsafe water sources or unimproved water supply sources 

 

29 

was at 64 percent of which 25 percent  was unprotected well, 18 percent river or lake and 2 
percent for other unimproved sources. For the purpose of this report, improved water sources 
were grouped as borehole and protected wells while unimproved water sources were grouped 
as unprotected wells and streams/ rivers or lakes.

Water Treatment and Treatment Options Applied by Households 
 
The assessment revealed that only 5percent of the households treated their water while the rest 
of 95percent of the households did not treat their drinking water in any way. The distribution 
of the type of treatment revealed that 50 percent of the population use chlorine while an equally 
number of households (50 percent) treat their water by boiling.  
 
MOH, MWDSEP and MLG need to promote water quality monitoring and control; and do a 
nation-wide community campaigns for household water treatment and safe storage. UNICEF 
and other donors need to support nation-wide capacity building for sustained promotion.

Sanitation Facilities 
 
The assessment revealed that the sanitation situation is dire, only 11.2 percent use improved 
latrines with the rest using traditional latrines or having no sanitation facility at all. For this 
assessment, improved sanitation facilities will include improved traditional latrines, Sanplats, 
VIP and Pour-flush/ Flush toilets. Of the 11.2 percent using improved Sanitation facilities, 6.1 
percent use the improved traditional latrines, 1 percent use Sanplats, 1 percent use VIP and 3.1 
percent use Pour-flush/ Flush toilets. The total household population using traditional latrines 
stood at 44.9 percent and followed by 26 percent having no sanitation facilities (and using the 
bush, river or cat method).

Solid Waste Management 
 
The assessment revealed that the majority of the households use Refuse Pits at 76.2 percentage 
for solid waste disposal, while the rest at 23.8 percent do not have refuse pits (Figure 22 below). 
Of  the  23.8  percent  that  do  not  have  Refuse  Pits  for  solid  waste  disposal,  71.4  percent 
indiscriminate disposal methods while the rest at 28.6 percent use other undisclosed methods 
for solid ate disposal (Figure 27 below).

4.14.  EDUCATION 
 
The assessment on the Education component focused mainly on School Attendance of school 
going children in the areas assessed. This was in order to determine whether the chronic food 
security had any bearing on school attendance. 
 
The  assessment  revealed  that  all  schools  servicing  these  communities  experienced  low 
attendance during the course of the year. However, the critical months mentioned were January 
(61  percent)  and  November  (9.8  percent)  followed  by  May  and  September  having  7.3  each 
percent as shown in the pie Chart below.

Reasons for low school attendance 
 
The  Assessment  results  in  Figure  30  below  showed  that  the  main  reason  for  low  school 
attendance was Hunger (27.5 percent); Working outside home for food or cash (20 percent) 
and  Collapsed  school  buildings  (20  percent);  Helping  with  household  chore  due  to  reduced 
household food (10 percent); Damaged roads/bridges (5 percent); and Others reasons (17.5).

4.15.  Infrastructure 
 
Infrastructure  serves  as  a  central  delivery  mechanism  in  achieving  sustainable  economic 
development  and  in  the  generation  of  quality  social-economic  development  in  the  country. 
Infrastructure still remains a major challenge to growth, economic diversification and human 
development  in  Zambia.    As  such,  Infrastructure  development,  is  one  of  the  Government’s 
priority areas in both the Seven National Development Plan (7NDP), and the National Vision 
2030.The aim is to achieve availability of reliable and affordable public infrastructure services 
for  sustained  economic  development  (SNDP,  2010).  The  priority  areas  on  infrastructure 
development will be on construction and rehabilitation of road networks, water and sanitation 
infrastructure,  airports  among  others.  The  Plan  also  gives  prominence  to  education,  health, 
social protection and rehabilitation of national infrastructure for development.  
 
The condition of the infrastructure such as roads, bridges and culverts is generally in poor state 
due to the oldness of the infrastructure. However, in the last four years, 2014/ 2015 and 2015/ 
2016  rainy  season  Zambia  experienced  two  consecutive  drought  conditions  which  had  a 
negative bearing on agriculture and food security, water and sanitation and energy which led 
to water shortage and power rationing. Although the last rainy season, 2016/ 2017 performed 
fairly, there are still a number of districts that indicated damaged infrastructure in the assessed 
districts because of flooding. According to the secondary data from the districts, most of the 
sectors that were impacted by the previous rainy season included blown- off roofs, wash-away 
roads, wash-away culverts, wash-away bridges and health centres on isolated cases. 
 
Therefore, in order to promote disaster preparedness, there is need to address the infrastructure 
gap in all sectors of the economy to enhance preparedness and mitigate against the impacts of 
climate  change  related  hazards.    Hence,  Government  through  the  relevant  sectors  need  to 
remedy  the  problem  of  infrastructure  by  channelling  resources  towards  rehabilitation  and 
reconstruction of damaged infrastructure as per the attached annex 2.  
 
4.16.  Social Protection 

According  the  National  Social  Protection  Policy  of  2014,  Social  protection  is  defined  as 
policies and practices that protect and promote the livelihoods and welfare of people suffering 
from critical levels of poverty and deprivation and/or are vulnerable to risks and shocks. 
 
Poverty and vulnerability continue to persist in Zambia with the country recording a stubbornly 
high rate of poverty.  According to the 2015 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey, poverty 
remains predominantly a rural phenomenon with poverty levels at 76.6 percent compared to 
23. 4 percent in urban areas. Most of the rural populations rely on subsistence agriculture (52.3 
percent),  these  households  use  traditional  agricultural  methods  and  have  limited  access  to 
markets and other resources that would enhance their productivity hence they generate very 
little income to propel them out of poverty. This compromises their capacity to be resilient in 
the wake of disasters such as droughts, floods, pest infestation, epidemic’s and/or periods of 
price  fluctuations.  Accelerating  poverty  reduction  will  require  large-scale  and  continuous 
investments to improve agricultural productivity, the backbone of the rural economy.

Social Assistance 
 
 Programmes  under  social  assistance  include  Public  Welfare  Assistance  Scheme  (PWAS), 
Social Cash Transfer Scheme (SCT), nutrition and supplementary feeding interventions such 
as  the  Home-Grown  School  Feeding  Programme,  and  the  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  of 
people with disabilities (PWDs) and Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVCs). 
 
Livelihood and Empowerment 
 
Generic  forms  of  livelihood  and  empowerment  interventions  typically  include  provision  of 
finance,  agricultural  inputs  and  entrepreneurship  skills  including  public  works  to  promote 
community infrastructure and assets. In Zambia, specific programmes implemented include the 
Farmer Input Support Programme, Food Security Pack, and Women Empowerment Fund.

(SCT, FSIP, FSP) were not found in all the districts visited, these programmes are operational 
in  all  the  districts  of  the  country.  Non-availability  of  programmes  not  mentioned  in  certain 
districts is an indication that the programmes have not yet been rolled out to the areas visited 
by Assessment teams. 
 
Social Protection Programmes and Perception of Their Impact on Areas Assessed 
 
The assessment looked at social protection programmes being implemented in areas visited, 
their extent of spread and the impact of the programmes on the livelihood of the communities. 
The social protection programmes mentioned at  District level were FISP, SCT, FSP, school 
Feeding  Programmes,  Relief  Food,  and  Child  Grant.  However,  not  all  these  were  being 
implemented in the communities visited by assessment teams as is shown by the explanations 
below. 
 
Social Cash Transfer 
 
The Social Cash Transfer(SCT) has been rolled out to all districts in the country. However, 
despite the roll out, the programme has not gone down to remote areas of the Country. Out of 
the 16 districts visited 10 districts indicated that there was SCT programme being implemented 
by  the  ministry  of  Community  Development  and  social  services  in  communities  that  were 
visited.  
 
The assessment revealed that SCT had a high impact in Mambwe and Petauke while Mulobezi 
indicated  that  there  was  no  impact  on  the  livelihoods  of  the  communities  visited.  The 
communities  interviewed  revealed  that  SCT  has  been  able  to  assist  them  with  payment  of 
school fees and other household requisites. It has also been able to improve their standard of 
living.  An impact  evaluation study that was done in  Monze on the use of funds from  SCT 
revealed  that  money  was  mainly  spent  on  food,  medication  and  education  (school  fees  and 
other school requisites), investment in small business such as Tuntemba (World Bank, 2011). 
 
Farmer Input Support Programme 
 
The Farmer Input Support Programme(FISP) is a national wide programme which started in 
2002  and  has  since  then  been  rolled  out  to  all  the  districts  of  Zambia  by  the  Ministry  of 
Agriculture. From the assessed 16 districts it was reported that, only 6 districts had FISP being 
implemented in the communities that were visited. 
 
The programme recorded a high impact in Chama followed by Gwembe and Sinazongwe while 
there was no impact on the livelihoods of the communities in Petauke. The programme assisted 
the communities in accessing farming inputs (fertiliser and seed). This helped many families 
in increasing crop production and therefore enhanced household food security. 
 
Food Security Pack Programme 
 
The Food Security Pack(FSP) Programme is a national social transfer programme to address 
poverty and food insecurity. It provides small packages of seed and fertiliser to vulnerable but 
viable  families.  It  is  targeted  to  households  that  face  food  insecurity  as  a  result  of  chronic 
poverty or insufficient rainfall and is intended to reach smallholder households. 
 

 

36 

The assessment revealed that only 5 out of 16 districts were implementing the Food Security 
Pack  programme  through  the  Ministry  of  Community  Development  and  social  Services 
(MCDSS) in the communities visited by the teams. The programme reported high impact in 
Sinazongwe and Chama districts. Since this programme targeted those that are vulnerable but 
viable, it helped them to improve household food security.  
 
Food Relief Programme 
 
The  Relief  Food  Programme  is  a  social  safety  net  given  only  to  those  districts  where 
vulnerability in-depth  assessments have been done and recommendations made for relief by 
Office the Vice President. The relief supplied helps communities to recover from the shocks 
that they experienced. Most of these areas visited indicated that they received relief food to 
cushion the food insecurity during the period when they are run out of food especially during 
the lean period. 
 
The Food relief programme was reported to have been implemented in 4 districts of Mambwe, 
Sinazongwe, Sesheke and Mwandi. In terms of impact, high impact was reported in Mambwe 
District. 
 
School Feeding Programmes 
 
The School Feeding Programme is a Social Protection Programme in the Ministry of General 
Education.    This  programme  is  intended  to  serve  the  dual  purposes  of  increasing  food 
consumption  among  the  poor  as  well  as  attracting  and  retaining  children  in  school  and 
improving their learning outcomes. This programme enhances school attendance in these areas 
that are chronically food insecure. 
 
The assessment revealed that SFP was being implemented in (5) five districts by the Ministry 
of General Education in collaboration with World Food Programme. The highest impact of the 
programme was reported in Sesheke followed by Gwembe District.  
 
Child Grant 
 
The Child grant initiated in 2010, provides a monthly cash payment to all mothers with a child 
under the age of 5years old in selected districts with very high poverty and child mortality rates. 
The overall objective of the Child Grant programme is to reduce poverty and inter-generation 
transmission of poverty. Specific objectives include improvements in food security, reduction 
in child mortality and morbidity, reduction in stunting and wasting. Increased school enrolment 
and attendance and increased asset ownership. 
 
The  assessment  revealed  that  the  Child  Grant  programme  was  only  being  implemented  in 
Chirundu and Sioma districts of Western Province and recorded a high impact in communities 
it was serving.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

5.1. Risk Analysis and Early Warning 
 
Conclusion 
 
The  2016/  2017  Assessment  revealed  that  the  major  hazards  that  affected  the  people  in  the 
valley areas are pest infestations, droughts, floods, animal human conflict, livestock diseases 
and human diseases which were impacting negatively on rural livelihoods of the people. The 
Assessment  further  showed  that  though  the  households  were  slowly  recovering  from  the 
negative impacts of chronic hazards in the last five years they have not fully recovered from 
the phenomenon. The assessment also showed that very poor households were highly impacted 
compared to the better of households. The Assessment revealed a significant increase of access 
to early warning information. 
 
Recommendations 
 
Short –term 
 
•  Sensitization of communities on use of early warning information for preparedness 
•  Promotion of proven technologies to communities facing Human – Animal conflict to assist 

in protecting their crops. 

•  The  District  Disaster  Management  Committee  in  collaboration  with  stakeholders  must 

work on the timely provision of early warning information to rural households. 

 
Medium/ Long term 
 
•  There is urgent need to address the issue of animal / human conflict for households in the 
parks by deploying more officers from the Department of National Parks and Wildlife to 
safeguard lives and the livelihoods of the people. 

•  There is need to deal with the underlining factors of chronic vulnerability by establishing 

Disaster Risk Reduction Centres. 

•  Government must invest in the establishment of hydro- meteorological infrastructure and 
dissemination mechanisms to improve on the accuracy and timely dissemination of early 
warning information. 

 
5.2. Agriculture and Food Security 
 
Conclusions 
 
The country is food secure and has more than enough food to meet its domestic and export 
requirements. However, there are still pockets of moderate food insecurity incidences in some 
communities that can be addressed through markets and Government on-going programmes 
such as the conventional and emergency social cash transfers and food for work. The numbers 
of  households  that  require  support  amount  to  12,  848  in  nine  districts  namely  Chirundu, 
Luangwa, Mambwe, Sioma, Shangombo, Sesheke, Siavonga, Gwembe and Nyimba. 
 
•  Livelihood  diversity  still  remains  low  with  majority  of  the  households  in  the  assessed 
districts dependent on agricultural based livelihoods (e.g. crop production, livestock rearing 
and agriculture wage labour).  

 

38 

•  The  permanent  and  seasonal  cash  incomes  in  the  assessed  districts  are  also  largely 

agricultural based mainly being sale of crops and agricultural wage labour. 

•  Delivery of extension services in the assessed districts are very poor or non – existent. 
•  Utilizing a composite index of FCS, Expenditure Share on food and coping behaviour, the 

results of the survey showed that 9 districts in six provinces would require assistance.  

 
 
Recommendations 
 
Short – term 
 
•  Provide relief to the 12, 878 households in the short term to ensure that these do not sell off 
productive  assets.  The  amount  of  relief  required  for  nine  months  for  these  households 
amounts to 5, 203 metric tons (see table below).

•  Ensure that all the schools situated in Chronically food insecure areas are included in school 

feeding programmes including take home parcels. 

•  Open – up discussions with cooperating partners to aid some cash based relief to promote 

and augment functioning of markets. 

•  Promotion  of  small  ruminants  (goats)  and  poultry  as  these  have  great  potential  in  the 

environment. 

•  The  Food  Security  Pack  Programme  should  increase  the  coverage  areas  to  include  the 

chronic food insecure areas of the country. 

•  Put in place a monitoring mechanism that tracks food security parameters in all the chronic 

food insecure regions. 

 
Medium/ Long term 
 
•  Need  for  the  construction  of  bulking  centres  for  these  areas  in  order  for  agri-business 

industries to pick up their livestock products. 

 

39 

• 

•  Owing  to  existence  of  many  dambos  and  rivers  there  is  need  to  promote  community 
irrigation schemes and water harvesting so that all year production of crops and vegetables 
can be achieved. 
It is clear from the Assessment that the agro – climatic conditions in the assessed districts 
are  not  suitable  for  growing  maize  and  from  this  basis,  it  is  recommended  that  farmers 
embrace agriculture diversification and prioritise livestock farming particularly production 
of  small  ruminants,  poultry  and  fish  farming  in  order  to  maximise  their  production  and 
incomes. 

•  Strengthen support to conservation agriculture. 
 
5.3.Human Health and Nutrition 
 
Conclusion 
 
As the analysis in this report has demonstrated a wide range of factors among them social and 
economic, influence health both at district and facility level. It should be noted that improving 
and  maintaining  health  at  community  level  largely  lies  in  the  community  themselves  and 
stakeholders / partners that operate in those areas (Public Private Partnership). Enhancement 
of collective responsibility and marshalling resources to the right sectors or areas of concern 
would help in improving the health of the general populous in the affected districts. As a tool 
for evaluating the delivery of health services among communities, there is need to intensify 
performance. 
 
Recommendations 
 
Short – term 
 
•  Need for districts and facilities to be conducting data reviews  as scheduled and enhance 

proper data storage at all levels. 

•  The districts to enhance community involvement at facility level and put in place structures 

that would collaborate with health staff and improve service delivery. 

•  The  districts  to  undertake  robust  preventive  and  sensitization  programs  in  an  effort  to 
reduce the prevalence rates of preventable diseases i.e. Malaria, diarrhoea and nutritional 
deficiencies. 

•  Districts to fully implement supplementary feeding programs. 
•  Districts to lobby for adequate HIV/AIDS logistics and other supplies to meet the growing 

• 

demand raise awareness and intensify voluntary counselling and testing services. 
Intensify immunisation and vaccination activities for under 5 children to further reduce the 
prevalence rates in affected districts e.g. Measles e.t.c. 

 
Medium/ Long Term 
 
• 

Implement and build capacity by offering technical support to nutritional staff/dieticians in 
Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and Integrated management in child illnesses.  

•  The  districts  to  organise  and  arrange  for  adequate  ITN  supplies  for  distribution  to  the 

communities. 

•  Lobby  for  provision  of  adequate  and  safe  water  as  well  as  household  water  treatment 

supplies e.g. Chlorine and encourage communities to build proper toilets for themselves. 

 

 

40 

5.4. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) 
 
Conclusions 
 
The assessment revealed that household access to total safe water or improved water supply by 
main sources was only at 36 percent of which 31 percent was boreholes and 5 percent protected 
wells. The household access to total unsafe water sources or unimproved water supply sources 
was at 64 percent of which 25 percent  was unprotected well, 18 percent river or lake and 2 
percent  for  other  unimproved  sources.  The  worst  affected  valley  areas  for  the  unsafe  water 
supply are in Nyimba, Petauke, Chirundu and Sesheke with 100 percent water supply provided 
through river/ lakes. The best being Chavuma and Mulobezi being the best with 67 percent of 
the water sources being boreholes. Further, the assessment revealed that only 5percent of the 
households treated their water while the rest of 95percent of the households did not treat their 
drinking water in any way. The distribution of the type of treatment revealed that 50percent of 
the population use chlorine while an equally number of households (50percent) treat their water 
by boiling.  
 
The  assessment  also  revealed  that  the  sanitation  situation  is  dire,  only  11.2  percent  use 
improved latrines with the rest using traditional latrines or having no sanitation facility at all 
(practicing open defecation). The total household population using traditional latrines stood at 
44.9 percent  and followed by 26 percent having no sanitation facilities (and using the bush, 
river or cat method). The assessment revealed that the majority of the households use Refuse 
Pits at 76.2 percentage for solid waste disposal, while the rest at 23.8 percent do not have refuse 
pits. 
 
The Government through 7th National Development Plan promises to enhance water supply 
and sanitation through established local authorities, commercial utilities, the private sector and 
communities. During the Plan period, infrastructure development will be prioritized in rural 
areas, to improve the livelihoods of the rural population where the majority of the poor live. 
Focus will also be on addressing water-related hazards, promotion of resilience of water and 
sanitation, infrastructure development including construction, rehabilitation and retro-fitting. 
Capacity development will be enhanced to incorporate disaster risk reduction into the design 
and  construction  of  facilities.  Research  in  water  supply  and  sanitation  will  be  enhanced  to 
mitigate  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  water  utilization  in  all  sectors  of  the  economy. 
Further, information, education and communication on sanitation services will be stepped up 
to  influence  behavioural  change  and  nationwide  campaigns  against  littering  and  messages 
encouraging the population to access services will be accelerated.  
 
Recommendations 
 
Short - Term 
 
In terms of water sources (working in liaison with MWDSEP, MLG, MOCTA, D-WASHE, 
DDMC and Satellite Disaster Management Committees): 
•  MOH, MWDSEP and MLG need to promote water quality monitoring and control; and do 
a  nation-wide  community  campaigns  for  household  water  treatment  and  safe  storage. 
Household Water treatment and safe storage should be prioritized as other interventions are 
being planned.  

•  Plan for water harvesting facilities at community and household levels for climate change 

adaptation. 

 

41 

Medium/Long Term 
 
•  Plan  for  rehabilitations,  improvements  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  existing  water 
infrastructure; and assess and search for new water sources in needy areas based on the 7th 
National Development Plan; 

•  Drill boreholes in areas where water sources are unimproved, especially where the water 
sources are unprotected wells and streams/ lakes. Most of the valley areas are unreachable 
by rigs so manual drilling will be used in unreachable valley communities/ villages. 

•  Promote community level modern energy adoption, water supply and sanitation technology 
options, disaster risk reduction and resilience building including climate change adaptation 
activities, to ensure preparedness, resilience and mitigation of disasters. 

 
Sanitation 
 
Short – term 
 
•  Sensitization of communities on the benefits of construction of improved latrines. 
•  The government at national, provincial and districts levels should encourage the formation 
of a practical WASH Chiefdom and Community Action Plans for improving WASH access 
generally. 

•  Promoting  CLTS,  monitoring  and  maintaining  ODF  status,  maintaining  a  clean 
environment generally, and make use of traditional leaders, local religious leaders and the 
influence  and  opportunities  they  have  in  bringing  messages  of  personal  cleanliness  and 
well-being  to  their  community.  Redouble  the  handwashing  campaign  with  the 
implementation of the ODF Zambia 2030 program. 

 
Medium/ Long Term 
 
In terms of sanitation facilities and Hygiene (working with MWDSEP, MLG, MOCTA, MOH, 
MCDSW, D-WASHE, DDMC and Satellite Disaster Management Committees): 
•  Construct demonstration latrines at the schools, health centres, and rural community centres 
using sanitation marketing methods (markets, faith centres, and traditional chiefs’ palaces) 
as well as latrines for vulnerable households. Work with households and the private sector 
through sanitation marketing to build robust and appropriate latrines versions from the start 
(taking  the  transformation  agenda,  7th  National  Development  Plans,  Vision  2030  for 
Zambia, Agenda 2063 for Africa and SDG 2030 for UN), even though the latrines may be 
basic or aspirational.  

•  Promote  “Smart”  subsidies  targeted  to  particularly  vulnerable  groups  (including  cash 
transfers), or to households facing significant technical and physical challenges to latrine 
building (mason/ artisan technical support).  

•  Promote  public-private  partnerships  or  private  involvement  to  build  sanitation  shops  at 
District/Chiefdom level through sanitation marketing to sell sanitation facilities and give 
advice on improved sanitation facility construction, operation and maintenance. 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

42 

5.5. Education 
 
Conclusion 
 
Low attendance in schools located in areas is a function of low performance in education. The 
assessment  revealed  that  chronically  food  insecure  areas  deserve  good  facilities  to  promote 
education attainments. 
 
Recommendations – Short Term 
 
•  Ensure that all the schools situated in Chronically food insecure areas are included in school 

feeding programmes being implemented in these districts. 

•  There is need to ensure accessibility to the schools situated in chronically food insecure 
areas through rehabilitation/construction of access roads and bridges since some schools 
indicated accessibility as one of the causes of low attendance. 
 

5.6. Infrastructure 
 
Conclusions 
 
The assessment on infrastructure from secondary data established that there was significant but 
moderate  damage  on  roads,  health,  bridges,  culverts  and  school  infrastructure.  Close  to  42 
schools,  39  Bridges-  culverts,  9  roads  and  1  clinic  were  damaged  and  will  need  to  be 
rehabilitated (Refer to the annexes on infrastructure damage).  
 
Recommendations 
 
Short – Term 
 
•  There  is  need  to  mobilize  funds  for  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  damaged 

infrastructure in the valley areas enhance access to markets, health and social facilities. 

 
Medium/ Long Term 
 
•  There is need to invest in water harvesting/ irrigation infrastructure as well as construction 

of feeder roads to easy the transportation of goods and services. 

 
5.7.Social Protection 
 
Conclusions 
 
The extent to which people do not have enough to eat is a very good measure of the need for 
safety nets. These safety nets will contribute in cushioning the communities from deprivation. 
The  assessment  revealed  that  the  chronically  food  insecure  areas  visited  will  require  a 
combination of various social protection programmes in order to enhance household food and 
social security. 
 
There is need to ensure that all the chronic food insecure areas/communities are targeted under 
the SCT programme being implemented in Districts where these communities are situated. The 

 

43 

Food Security Pack Programme should increase the coverage areas to include the chronic food 
insecure areas of the country. 
 
 
Recommendations 
 
Short – Term  
 
•  There is need to ensure that all the chronic food insecure areas/communities are targeted 
under the SCT programme being implemented in Districts where these communities are 
situated. 

•  The  Food  Security  Pack  Programme  should  increase  the  coverage  areas  to  include  the 

chronic food insecure areas of the country. 

 
Medium/ Long Term 
 
•  There is  need to  lobby for the increasing numbers of eligible households in  the districts 

where the Social Protection programmes are being implemented.
