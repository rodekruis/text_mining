EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
The 2007/08 rainy season started on a good note with the southern half of the country experiencing an 

early  onset  while  the  extreme  northern  parts  had  a  late  onset.  From  the  month  of  November  2007  to 

January 2008, the rainfall activity increased substantially in the southern half of the country resulting in 

widespread heavy rains that caused floods in these areas.   

In  view  of  the  aforementioned  above,  the  Zambia  Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee  (ZVAC) 

conducted  a  Rapid  Flood  Assessment  in  February  2008  to  establish  the  effects  of  the  floods  and  /or 

water logging in various sectors. The assessment established that floods resulted into the destruction of 

crops,  infrastructure  such  as  bridges,  culverts,  habitations,  school  buildings  and  health  centres.  It  was 

evident  from  the  rapid  assessment  that  in  most  of  the  districts  where  infrastructure  damage  was 

prominent, access to basic services such as health, schools and markets had been hampered. This led to 

the ZVAC to conduct an In-depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment in order to determine the effects 

and extent of the floods, water logging and dry spells on crops, livestock and food access, infrastructure 

and  habitation,  health,  nutrition,  water  and  sanitation,  education  and  child  protection.  The  assessment 

was conducted in thirty-nine (39) districts.  

The  In-depth  Vulnerability  and  Needs  Assessment  employed  two  survey  approaches,  that  is,  the 

qualitative and quantitative approach. Under quantitative approach, structured household questionnaires 

were  employed  in  518 Standard  Enumeration  Areas  (SEAs)  targeting  a  total  of  5,180  households  in all 

the  39  districts  (fourteen  SEAs  per  district).    Furthermore,  under  the  qualitative  approach,  community 

interviews were also conducted in all the 518 Standard Enumeration Areas. In each of the sampled SEAs, 

anthropometric  data  collection  methods  were  employed  to  collect  nutrition  data  for  the  under-five 

children.  

Major findings 

The following are the major findings of the assessment: 

•  A  total  of  444,624  people  (74,104  Households)  in  twenty-one  (21)    of  the  thirty-nine  (39) 

assessed districts were found to be in need of food assistance and would require 33,333 metric 

tons of maize for the period of nine (9) months starting from July 2008 to March 2009. 

•  Major  income  sources  for  most  of  the  rural  households  were  found  to  be  cash/food  crop 

production, casual labour and petty trading.  

•  Maize  grain  prices  have  started  falling  following  the  April/May  08  harvest.  However  maize  meal 

prices  have  remained  high  due  to  the  time  lag  between  the  harvest  and  when  the  new  grain  is 

dry enough for milling.  The price reductions are generally larger in rural areas than in the urban 

areas. 

•  The prevalence of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) was found to be 2.3% out of which 0.6% had 

bilateral oedema. Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) was 7.7% indicating an increase of 2.1% from 

the  June 2007 In-Depth Assessment findings. These results show no  significant differences from 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee – 2008

the  In-Depth  survey  of  2007,  although  the  rates  of  malnutrition  showed  a  slight  increase 

compared to 2007. 

•  Overall  the  assessment  recorded  high  immunization  coverage  in  all  the  eligible  children.  The 

measles  coverage  of  96.2  %  was  recorded  among  children  aged  between  9-59  months,  98.7% 

was recorded for OPV and DPT immunization while the BCG coverage was found to be at 97.6%. 

The  health  card  (61.7%)  and  verbal  history  provided  by  the  caregiver  (34.5%)  were  the  main 

source of information for child immunization. 

•  Breastfeeding  status  was  based  on  maternal  recall.  At  the  time  of  the  assessment,  80.1%  of 

mothers were still breastfeeding. Breastfeeding among children below 6 months of age was very 

high (98.9) in all the 39 districts. 

•  For water and sanitation, 44.2% of the communities drew water from unprotected water sources 

as their main water source. This indicates that majority of the communities affected by the flood 

will  require new water  points to be constructed but the  need is much higher  when you consider 

communities  that  drew  from  unprotected  sources  but  were  affected  by  the  dry  spells  such  as 

those in Northern and Eastern Provinces. 

•  Of the 28.9% of households that indicated that they treated their water, three quarters of these 

households use chlorine. The remainder indicated that they actually boil their water. 

•  About  2%  of  school  going  children  in  the  areas  assessed  dropped  out  of  school  because  of 

collapsed  school  buildings  as  a  result  of  the  floods.  In  some  of  the  affected  areas  the  school 

children shifted to the higher and drier lands where they continued with their education while in 

other  areas  the  learning  processes  continued  in  make  shift  structures  and/or  other  community 

centres.  However,  this  was  not  conducive  for  learning  and  the  quality  of  education  was 

compromised.  Furthermore  the  relocation  to  the  drier 

lands  and  alternative 

learning 

environments, took away valuable learning time from the school children.  

•  A  total  of  18%  of  the  respondents  in  the  assessed  communities  reported  that  there  were 

incidences  of  violence  against  women  and children  during  the  flooding and  post flooding  period. 

The  most  common  cases  were;  early  marriages,  assault,  sexual  exploitation,  rape,  child 

defilement  and  other  types  of violence. In  most  of the  instances  the  main perpetrators  of  these 

cases were mainly relatives/neighbours, other people and development workers.  

•  The  findings  on  Human  Settlement  and  Shelter  established  that  a  total  of  82,662  households 

(495,972  people)  were  displaced  by  the  floods.  The  worst  affected  provinces  were;  southern 

province  accounting  for  33%  of  the  displaced  cases,  followed  by  western  province  at  28%, 

northern province at 10% and central province at 7%. In terms of location segregation, 87% of 

the displaced cases were in the rural areas while 13% were in urban areas.   

•  The assessment established that 66%  of the road infrastructure (roads, bridges and culverts) in 

the assessed districts were either washed away or severely damaged. 

•  The floods had adverse effects on the environment and caused soil erosion and the formation of 

gullies that could lead to further deterioration of the environment.  

•  Early  Warning  Systems  were  effected  through  various  modes  of  communication  including; 

electronic media, print media and the use of local authorities and government agencies. However, 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee – 2008

73% of the respondents in the assessed areas claim that they were not warned, while out of the 

27% of those who indicted that they were warned 63% did not heed to these warnings and hence 

did not take any preventive measures. 

 

CONCLUSIONS 

 

Food Security 

The  impact  of  the  floods,  water  logging  and  prolonged  dry  spells  on  crops  was  particularly 

pronounced in six (6) provinces namely Central, Copperbelt, Luapula, Lusaka, Southern and Western. 

Of  the  thirty-nine  (39)  districts  visited,  twenty-one  (21)  were  found  to  have  experienced  drastic 

reduction  in  their  harvest  of  the  main  staple  and  would  require  some  food  assistance.  A  total  of 

444,624  people  (74,104  Households)  were  found  to  be  in  need  of  food  assistance  in  the  21 

districts and therefore would require 33, 333 Metric tons of cereal for a period of nine (9) months. 

Livestock prices (mainly cattle) in almost all assessed districts rose in December. The fact that prices 

in most districts rose suggests that there was no desperation for households to sell off their cattle at 

low  prices  as  they  were  able  to  negotiate  for  higher  prices.  The  highest  cattle  price  increases  were 

recorded in Sinazongwe, Mumbwa, Mazabuka, Namwala and Sesheke. This shows that at the time of 

the  assessment,  the  impact  of  the  livestock  ban  movement  due  to  the  Foot  and  Mouth  Disease 

outbreak had not yet started reducing income for farmers.     

 

In  the  39  assessed  districts  maize  prices  were  high,  especially  in  the  low  producing  districts  of 

Sinazongwe,  Shang’ombo,  Kalabo,  Lukulu,  Zambezi,  Mambwe  and  Mongu  where  the  prices  were 

above K1, 200/Kg. Sinazongwe particularly reported abnormally high prices even for a low producing 

district of K1, 900/Kg, an indication of a possible shortage.   

Among  the  high  producing  districts,  only  Mumbwa  reported  high  maize  prices  of  K1,  280/Kg,  an 

indication of significant supply reduction.  

 

Health and Nutrition 

The  prevalence  of  Severe  Acute  Malnutrition  (SAM)  was  found  to  be  2.3%  out  of  which  0.6%  had 

bilateral  oedema.  Global  Acute  Malnutrition  (GAM)  was  7.7%  indicating  an  increase  of  2.1%  from 

the June 2007 In-Depth Assessment findings. 

 

The  assessment  established  that  immunization  coverage  was  high  in  all  the  assessed  districts.  The 

measles coverage of 96.2 % was recorded among children aged between 9-59 months, 98.7% was 

recorded for OPV and DPT immunization while the BCG coverage was found to be at 97.6%. A small 

percentage (0.3%) of the eligible children did not receive vaccines while 3.5% of the child caretakers 

did not know whether the child had been immunized or not

There  was  no  severe  impact  of  floods  on  physical  health  infrastructure  in  all  the  assessed  districts. 

However,  Mkushi,  Mumbwa,  Lufwanyama,  Masaiti,  Mpongwe,  Ndola  and  Mpulungu  reported  minor 

damages on some health facilities. 

Water and Sanitation 

From the findings it is clear that the floods in the 2007/2008 season increased water contamination 

in unprotected water sources like rivers or lakes, unprotected shallow wells and unprotected springs 

which  accounted  for  37.9%  of  the  households.  This  is  evidenced  in  the  occurrence  of  diarrhoea 

diseases  amongst  households  that  draw  water  from  the  unprotected  sources  which  is  30.5%  for 

rivers or lakes being the highest. The impact on water quality was severe during the rainy season in 

areas that experienced floods and heavy rainfall. 

 

Education 
The  assessment  established  that  76%  (44%  males  and  32%  females)  of  the  children  dropped  out 

because  the  family  could  not  afford  to  meet  their  school  requirements,  15%  (8%  males  and  7% 

females) dropped  out  because  of  lack  of  interest  in  school  and  7%  (all  females)  drop out  of  school 

due to pregnancies. The other reasons for dropping out of school such as: work for food/cash; care 

for sick family member; hunger; and collapsed school were insignificant at 2%.  

Protection 

Incidences of violence against women and children in the communities and camps during the flooding 

period were not very common. However some cases were reported by 18% of the respondents. The 

most  common  cases  in  order  of  ranking  were;  early  marriages  (35%),  assault  (25%),  sexual 

exploitation (14%), rape (11%), child defilement (9%) and other types of violence (1%). In most of 

the  instances  the  main  perpetrators  of  these  cases  were  relatives/neighbours  and  other  people 

(94%), while development workers constituted 4% of the perpetrators.  

 

Human Settlement and Shelter 

The floods displaced 8% of the total households that were affected by the floods. This translates into 

a  total  of  82,662  households  (495,972  people).  The  worst  affected  provinces  were;  Southern 

Province accounting for 33% of the displaced cases, followed by Western Province at 28%, Northern 

Province at 10% and Central Province at 7%. In terms of location segregation, 87% of the displaced 

cases were in the rural areas while 13% were in urban areas.   

Infrastructure 
The  damages  caused  by  the  floods  on  infrastructure  were  mostly  on  roads,  bridges  and  culverts  – 

66% of the roads, bridges and culverts in the assessed areas were damaged. The floods also caused 

damage to school infrastructure on classroom blocks and sanitation facilities. Both basic schools and 

community  schools  were  affected.  The  community  schools  made  from  pole  and  mud  suffered 

structural damage due to the poor quality of materials used to construct them. The basic schools with 

permanent structures had their roofs blown off and their toilets collapsing.

General Findings 

The  floods  had  adverse  effects  on  the  environment  and  caused  soil  erosion  and  the  formation  of 

gullies that could lead to further deterioration of the environment.  

 

The assessment also established that early warning systems were effected through various modes of 

communication  including;  electronic  media,  print  media  and  the  use  of  local  authorities  and 

government  agencies.  However,  only  a  few  people  received  the  warning  but  did  not  take  any 

preventive measures.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 

1.1 

Background and Rationale 

The 2007/08 rainy season started on a good note with the southern half of the country experiencing an 

early  onset  while  the  extreme  northern  parts  had  a  late  onset.  From  the  month  of  November  2007  to 

January 2008, the rainfall activity increased substantially in the southern half of the country resulting in 

widespread heavy rains that caused floods in these areas.   

In  view  of  the  aforementioned  above,  the  Zambia  Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee  (ZVAC) 

conducted  a  Rapid  Flood  Assessment  in  February  2008  to  establish  the  effects  of  the  floods  and  /or 

water logging in various sectors. The assessment established that floods resulted into the destruction of 

crops,  infrastructure  such  as  bridges,  culverts,  habitations,  school  buildings  and  health  centres.  It  was 

evident  from  the  rapid  assessment  that  in  most  of  the  districts  where  infrastructure  damage  was 

prominent, access to basic services such as health, schools and markets had been hampered. 

This led to the ZVAC to conduct an In-depth Needs and Vulnerability Assessment in order to determine 

the  effects  and  extent  of  the  floods,  water  logging  and  dry  spells  on  crops,  livestock  and  food  access, 

infrastructure and habitation, health, nutrition, water and sanitation, education and child protection. The 

assessment was conducted in thirty-nine (39) districts.  

1.2  Main objective 

The assessment was aimed at determining the extent and effects of the floods and/or water logging on 

Infrastructure and Habitations, Health and Nutrition, Water and Sanitation, Education, Crops, Livestock, 

and Food Access.  

1.2.1  Specific Objectives 

The specific objectives of the assessment were; 

•  To determine the extent and impact of floods and/or water logging on crops and livestock. 

•  To determine the impact of floods on the main livelihoods of affected communities. 

•  To  determine  the  extent  and  impact  of  floods  on  Water  and  Sanitation,  Education  and 

Infrastructure. 

•  To determine the impact of varied rainfall intensity on markets. 

•  To identify worst affected areas as well as the population affected. 

•  To determine the effects of varied rainfall on heath and nutrition status of under-five children in 

the affected areas (children aged between 6-59 months). 

•  To determine food and non-food needs, if any. 

•  To determine the extent of violence against women and children in flood affected areas. 

 

1.3 
The floods and/or water logging affected people in thirty-nine (39) districts. The floods also affected all 

Scope of the In-depth vulnerability and needs assessment 

sectors  of  the  economy.  These  include  health  and  nutrition,  water  and  sanitation,  education, 

infrastructure (e.g. habitations, school buildings, health centres), and agriculture.  In order to ascertain

1.4 Methods and Procedures 

1.4.1 Sampling Frame 

Zambia is administratively, divided into nine provinces. Each province is in turn subdivided into districts. 

Each  district  is  further  subdivided  into  constituencies  and  wards.  For  statistical  purposes  each  ward  is 

subdivided  into  Census  Supervisory  Areas  (CSAs)  and  these  are  in  turn  subdivided  into  Standard 

Enumeration  Areas  (SEAs).  The  1998-2000  mapping  exercise  in  preparation  for  the  2000  census  of 

population  and  housing,  demarcated  the  CSAs  within  in  wards,  wards  within  constituencies  and 

constituencies within districts. In total, Zambia has 72 districts, 150 constituencies, 1,289 wards. Wards 

are  further  divided  into  CSAs,  which  are  in  turn  divided  into  Standard  Enumeration  Areas  (SEAs).  The 

SEAs  are  also  stratified  by  urban  and  rural  strata.  The  listing  of  SEAs  has  information  on  number  of 

households and the population. However, for the purposes of this survey, SEAs constituted the ultimate 

Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). Therefore, the sample frame for this survey is the list of SEAs developed 

from the 2000 Population Census.

1.4.2 Sample Stratification and allocation  

In  order  to  have  estimates  at  district  level,  as  well  as  equal  precision  in  the  estimates  in  the  selected 

districts, the Equal Sample Allocation Method (ESAM), based on the established minimum samples for a 

district,  has been adopted. In view  of that, each selected district had  a sample of 14  SEAs /PSU’s. The 

allocation of sample points in the selected District was done proportional to their estimated size that is 

the measure of size of each cluster based on the 2000 population census.  

 

1.4.3 Sample Selection 

The  In-Depth  Vulnerability  and  Needs  Assessment  employed  a  two-stage  stratified  cluster  sample 

design. In the first stage, 14 SEAs were selected from each of the 39 targeted districts.  

 

1.4.4 First Stage Selection  

At  the  first  sampling  stage,  the  sampled  SEAs  were  selected  within  each  district  identified  to  have 

received above normal rainfall systematically with probability to estimated size (PPES) from the ordered 

list of SEAs in the In-depth vulnerability sampling frame. The measure of size for each SEA was based on 

the population size identified in the 2000 Census. The frame of SEAs within each district was sorted by 

urban/rural  variable  which  provided  further  implicit  stratification.  The  following  first  stage  sample 

selection procedures were used:  

 

 

(1)  Sort  the  SEAs  within  each  district  by  the  following  codes:  region  (rural/urban),  constituency, 

ward, CSA and SEA. 

(2)  Cumulate  the  measures  of  size  (population)  down  the  ordered  list  of  SEAs  within  District.  The 

final cumulated measure of size will be the total population in the frame for the strata or district 

(Mds). 

(3) To obtain the sampling interval for district or stratum ds (Ids), divide Mds by the total number of 

SEAs to be selected in district ds (nds): 

 

Ids= Mds/nds  

The  Excel  software  was  used  for  selecting  the  sample  of  the  initial  518  sample  SEAs  for  the  In-depth 

Vulnerability Assessment survey following these procedures, based on the allocation of the sample SEAs, 

described Sample Stratification and allocation section above. Separate excel files per province were used 

showing  the  ordered  frame  of  SEAs  with  the  corresponding  2000  Zambia  Census  information.  It 

documents the first stage systematic selection of sample SEAs with PPS for each district stratum within 

the province for the selected districts.  The selected areas were arranged in a separate excel file used to 

calculate the weights for each selected HHLD in a district stratum.

1.4.5 Second Stage Selection 

The second stage of the sampling procedure involved the selection of households in the SEAs selected at 

the  first  stage.  Due  to  time  and  resource  limitations,  listing  to  get  the  updated  number  of  households 

was not done. For the purposes of this survey the measure of size (NSEA) for the PSUs was assumed to 

be that in Census 2000 frame. In each SEA 10 households (nSEA) were selected. The sampling interval k 

was calculated as follows: 

 

 

k= (NSEA)/ (nSEA). 

Every  k-th  household  in  the  selected  area  was  canvassed  until  all  the  required  10  households  were 

covered. 

 

1.4.6 Weighting Procedure 

In  order  for  the  sample  estimates  from  any  particular  survey  to be  representative  of  the  population,  it 

was necessary to multiply the data by a sampling weight, or expansion factor. In other words a sample 

of  households that were selected using a known probability, it was necessary to  make inference to the 

population where the sample came from. The raw data was multiplied by a factor which represented the 

actual population estimates. The basic weight for each sampled household was equal to the inverse of its 

probability of selection (calculated by multiplying the probabilities at each sampling stage). 

 

Based  on  the  sample  design  for  the  In-depth  Vulnerability  Survey,  the  probability  of  selection  within 

each SEA was different for the households depending on which strata it was sampled from i.e. flood, non 

flood (e.g. dry spell areas). The probability of selection for sample households in each stratum within a 

selected district was generalized as follows:

pdsi = probability of selection for the sample households within the i-th sample SEA in district or 

stratum ds 

mds= number of sampled SEAs selected in district ds. 

Ndsi = total number of households in the frame for the i-th sample SEA in district ds. 

Nds = total number of households in the frame for district ds. 

ndsi  =  number  of  sample  households  selected  in  a  district  s  from  the  given  number  of  hhlds 

(2000 census) for the i-th sample SEA in district h 

 

The two terms in pdsi correspond to the first and second stage probabilities of selection; at the first stage 

the SEAs were selected with probability proportional to size of population (PPS), and at the second stage 

the households were selected with estimated equal probability within each SEA.

The  basic  sampling  weight  was  equal  to  the  inverse  of  the  probability  of  selection.  Therefore  the 

corresponding basic weight for the sampled households in each district was calculated as follows: 

wdsi

Where:

wdsi  =  the  basic  weight  for  the  sample  household  selected  within  the  i-th  sample  SEA  in  each 

district. 

The first and second parts of the equation represents the weights for the two stages of selection i.e. first 

stage weight and second stage weight, respectively. The excel  file  with the selected areas was used to 

calculate  these  weights.  Since  listing  was  not  done,  the  basic  weights  for  this  survey  represent  the 

situation  as  at  2000.  So  the  weights  had  to  be  adjusted  so  as  to  account  for  population  growth  to 

represent  the  situation  for  the  survey  period  June  2007.  Post  stratification  adjustment  to  the  weights 

was done using the racking method as follow:

Where: 

 

wdis’=adjusted weight or the final weight. 

 

Dp2007=Projected district population from volume10 of the C.S.O 2000 Census Report 

 

Dpdata=initial weighted district population using survey data. 

 

The factor Dp2007 over Dpdata can be considered as the growth rate for the district. The final weights for 

calculating  the  survey  estimates  used  SPSS  and  STATA  software.  STATA  was  also  used  to  calculate 

variance  estimation  using  the  Taylor  Series  method  to  build  in  the  software  taking  into  account  the 

complex survey design.     

 

1.4.7 Estimates for Nutrition Component 

1.4.7.1 Sample size and sampling process for the household survey 

The sample size for the In-Depth Vulnerability survey was not large enough to have estimates at district 

level.  In  the  calculation  for  the  minimum  number  of  children  required  for  the  whole  survey  for  key 

nutrition indicators, it was found that 900 children would be required to get estimates at 95% confidence 

level  in  the  entire  survey  (39  districts)  that  is  the  minimum  number.  Based  on  the  national  and  NGO 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee – 2008

nutrition surveys, assumptions were made that each household would have an average of one child aged 

6 to 59 months, a household size of six members and one mother. Prevalence estimates were based on 

previous  surveys  carried  out  by  the  Government  departments  in  charge  of  nutrition  and  other  UN  and 

NGO agencies national wide. Due to the two-stage sampling technique that was used, it was necessary 

to increase the sample size by a factor that would allow for any loss in precision due to departure from 

simple random sampling. This was estimated using the Rapid Nutrition Survey of 2005 and the targeted 

nutrition assessment conducted in 2006 by GRZ, UNICEF and WFP. The 5,125 households covered in the 

in-depth study were more than adequate to meet the minimum sample size. The number of children that 

were successfully measured in the study was 2,444.  

 

1.4.7.2 Anthropometric measurement 

Survey  workers  measured  children’s  weight,  height/length,  and  assessed  the  presence  of  bilateral 

oedema.  Children  were  weighed  to  the  nearest  100  grams  using  a  digital  SECA  scale.  For  children 

younger than 2 years of age or less than 85 centimetres (cm) long, length was measured to the nearest 

millimetre  in  the  recumbent  position  using  a  standard  height  board.  Children  85  to  110  cm  were 

measured  in  a  standing  position.  Oedema  was  assessed  by  applying  thumb  pressure  to  the  feet  for 

approximately 3 seconds and then examining for the presence of a shallow print or pit. 

 

1.4.8  Analytical Approach 

 

1.4.8.1 Estimating food production in maize equivalent 

To  estimate  the  food  production  in  maize  equivalent  for  the  2007/08  production  season,  all  the  food 

crops  other  than  maize  (cereals  and  tubers) was  converted  into  one  common  unit  of  maize  kilocalorie. 

The crop used as a common unit for the conversion due to it being a widely consumed staple was maize. 

Before  computing  the  total  maize  equivalent  in  metric  tonnes,  each  of  the  other  main  crops  produced 

(i.e.  sorghum,  millet,  rice  and  cassava)  was  converted  into  maize  calorie  equivalent.  Furthermore,  in 

order  to  obtain  quantities  of  crops  in  maize  equivalent  produced,  the  quantity  of  the  crop  to  be 

converted  was  multiplied  by  the  ratio  of  its  unit  calorie  content  to  maize  as  illustrated  in  the  formula 

below;

1.4.8.2 Identifying Desperate Areas and Persons Affected  

In order to  identify the food deficit areas as well  as the number of affected population  in the identified 

districts, two screening levels were utilised. In the first level, 2006/07 household based production was 

used  as  a  base to  determine  a  drop  and/or  increase  in  cereal  production.  The  2007/08  production  gap 

and/or  surplus  were  calculated by taking  the  difference  in  the  household  based  production  with that of 

2006/07.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  household  based  production  was  computed  as  the  sum  of  maize, 

cassava,  rice,  sorghum  and  millet  all  converted  into  maize  calorie  equivalent  from  own  production, 

purchases, barter, remittances, food aid and any other sources that the sampled household. 

 

The other dimension considered to determine the number of food insecure populations was an inventory 

on  the  number  and  types  of  disposable  productive  assets  sampled  households  possessed.  Using  asset 

lens  to  determine  their  ability  to  offset  household  level  food  gap,  households  were  group  into  three 

category of asset wealth namely asset poor, asset moderate and asset rich. About thirty percent (30%) 

of  the  sampled  households  were  found  to  be  asset  poor  and  could  not  manage  to  offset  the  food  gap 

from August through to the next agricultural season without engaging into destructive response options 

such  as  sale  of  productive  assets.  Furthermore,  all  districts  which  were  found  with  a  percentage  of 

households  whose  food  gap  derived  as  stated  in  paragraph  one  of  chapter  1.4.8.2  was  from  30%  to 

60%. 

 

The  districts  which  were  found  to  have  households  who  had  food  gap  of  60%  from  the  base  year 

(2006/07 season), asset poor and their response options to be applied during the lean period was over 

reliance  on  consumption  of  vegetables, working  too long in  other  people’s  fields,  selling  of  assets  were 

classified as severely needy areas.  

 

 The maize gap was estimated as the percentage of total maize equivalent in a district as shown in the 

formula below  

 

 

Maize Gap 

= 

Quantity of Maize 

Produced (MT) - 08 

- 

Quantity of Cereal 

Produced (MT) -07 

x  100      (2) 

                                                                                                                

Quantity of Cereal 

Produced (MT) -07 

 

The number of the affected persons in need of food assistance was derived by averaging the percentage 

of  the  persons  affected  in  the  identified  districts  as  described  above.  This  was  complimented  and 

validated  by  the  percentages  estimates  derived  through  the  proportional  pilling  done  during  the 

community interviews.

1.4.8.3  Determination  of  cereal  requirements  for  the  affected  population  in  food 

insecure District 

The assessment used the following formula to determine the amount of cereal required by food insecure 

households: 

 

 

MAIZE REQUIREMENT1 = STANDARD RATION2 X # OF MONTHS3 X # AFFECTED PEOPLE 

 

1000 

 

Where,

Total maize requirements in Metric Tonnes (MT) refers to total quantity of maize required for the 

affected population in the needy districts 

Standard ration = 8.33 kilograms per person per month (278 g/person/day) 

Number of months = duration of the food assistance 

1.4.8.4 Assessing under five nutrition status  

The  anthropometrical  status  of  young  children  aged  between  6-59  months  was  taken  to  reflect  the 

nutritional status of the populations that were affected by floods and/or prolonged dry spells.  

This was done within the wider socio-economic and public health context for intervention recommendation 

in the broader perspective. This implies that in addition to anthropometrical data, the underlying causes of 

malnutrition and the health risks associated with malnutrition were assessed. 

Analysis  was  done  on  the  EPI-INFO  6.04,  SPSS  and  STATA  software  to  determine  the  prevalence  of 

severe  and  moderate  acute  malnutrition  on  the  basis  of  W/H  Z-scores  and  %  of  the  Median.  W/H  Z-

scores  are  used  because  this  is  the  most  reliable  statistical  measure  of  malnutrition,  and  is  the 

nutritional indicator recommended by WHO. Percentage of the median W/H was calculated because this 

is  easily  understood.  Also,  in  most  feeding  programmes  children  are  admitted  on  the  basis  of  %  W/H, 

hence the prevalence of malnutrition according to % W/H provided a better estimate of the number that 

can be anticipated for feeding programmes.   

 

Cut-off points for children:  

Classification: Indicator 

Moderate malnutrition< -2 W/H Z-scores and >-3 Z-scores 

Severe malnutrition: <- 3 W/H Z-scores and/or presence of bilateral pitting (oedema) of the feet.

confidence intervals were worked on to indicate the precision of the estimate obtained. The age and sex 

distribution of the population was analysed to see whether there was any abnormality. A high prevalence 

of malnutrition in children above 36 months is usually an indicator of acute food insecurity.     

1.5 

Limitations 

The In-depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment faced a few limitations that included the following: 

• 

Information  on  HIV  prevalence  could  not  be  collected  in  this  study,  although  it  would  have 

been useful, since HIV plays a key role in issues of food security. The design of this study did 

not allow for collection of HIV/AIDS prevalence information since such meaningful information 

can only be done through actual testing of people in the visited households which was outside 

the  scope  of  this  study.  However,  proxy  information  on  HIV  was  captured.  This  included 

information on chronic illnesses among adults at household level.    

• 

 Information on water quality was qualitative based on aesthetic characteristics as the actual 

scientific tests of water could not be done within the framework of the assessment. 

•  The small sample size for nutrition does not permit making generalisations at district level.

CONTEXT  

The Economy  

The economy has continued to register positive growth going by the real gross domestic product which 

increased from 5.8% in 2006 to 6.2% in 2007 though remained below the 7% target for the year 2007.  

Although the 2007 end of year annual inflation rate at 8.9% was slightly higher than the 8.2% recorded 

at the end of 2006, it was consistent with the revised target of 9% and generally low with respect to the 

high  rates  which  prevailed  in  the  year  2005.  Reduced  domestic  borrowing  and  increased  build  up  of 

gross  international  reserves  also  recorded  achievements.  The  growth  rate  was  largely  driven  by  the 

construction and  transport sectors  while,  agriculture,  tourism,  manufacturing and  mining  also  recorded 

positive growth. However, growth in some of these sectors was slower than what was achieved in 2006 

for a number of reasons. In the mining sector for instance, growth was slowed down on account of the 

flooding which affected some mines in the first half of the year. Interest rates have been gradually falling 

though  still  prohibitive  for  borrowing.  This  impediment  to  borrowing  has  kept  private  investment  in 

agriculture  very  low.  The  low  investment  in  agricultural  equipment  and  early  warning/preparedness 

systems has left the sector highly vulnerable to climatic change. 

 

The growth  in the  agriculture  sector  slowed  down to  2.8%  in  2007  compared  to  3  percent  achieved  in 

2006.  This  reduction  was  mainly  attributed  to  the  poor  prices  offered  for  cotton  and  tobacco  which 

resulted  in  drastic  drop  in  production  of  the  two  crops.  Despite  the  2006/07  production  season  being 

characterised by localised adverse rainfall in the middle of the growing season, surplus maize production 

of  1.36  was  achieved,  though  marking  a  marginal  reduction  of  4%  with  respect  to  the  2005/06 

production  season.  The  2007/08  production  season  was  also  characterized  by  adverse  rainfall  in  the 

southern parts of the country reducing maize production by 11% compared to the 2006/07 season, but 

average  production  of  1.2  million  tons  was  achieved  ensuring  sufficient  in  country  stocks  to  meet

national  demand.  Continued  support  to  small  scale  farmers  through  programmes  such  as  the  fertilizer 

support programme, food security pack and out grower schemes have to a certain extent helped sustain 

high production particularly for food crops. As agriculture has remained a key sector in economic growth, 

Government intends to continue supporting increased crop production with focus on improved cash crop 

production through programmes such as fertilizer support programme and irrigation development. Other 

areas  of  focus  include  improved  livestock  and  fisheries  development.  In  the  livestock  sector,  the  focus 

will  be  disease  monitoring  and  control  coupled  with  livestock  restocking  in  an  effort  to  revamp  the 

sector.  

 

2.2  Agriculture and Food Security 

2.2.1  Input Distribution 

Various Input Distribution Programmes have continued to have a positive impact on the provision inputs 

to  farmers  in  the  past  six  (6)  agricultural  seasons.    Unfortunately,  most  farmers  remain  substantially 

dependent  on  inputs  distributed  by  the  Government  and  Non  Governmental  Organisations  without 

graduating  into  self  sustaining  farmers.  The  major  input  programmes  are  GRZ  Fertilizer  Support 

Programme (FSP), PAM’s Food Security Pack (FSP) and the FAO input programme. All these programmes 

were necessitated by the need to facilitate farmers’ recovery from previous droughts.

Although  input  support  to  small  scale  farmers  increased  in  2006/07  season,  there  was  general  down 

sizing  in  the  2007/08  season.  This  was  attributed  to  the  increased  cost  of  fertilizer  and  Government’s 

inability to  increase the funding towards this program after fertilizer prices increased. Fertilizer support 

dropped substantially by 42 percent in 2007/08 compared to the 2006/07 season. At the same time, the 

number of beneficiaries reduced by 50 percent. In an effort to support increased production, government 

has set aside funds for the Fertilizer Support Program targeting 125,000 beneficiaries for 2008/09 main 

production season.  

 

In  view  of  the  100%  increase  in  the  price  of  fertilizer,  Government  will  need  to  substantially  increase 

funding  to  this  programme  in  order  to  provide  the  same  quantity  of  inputs  as  those  of  the  2007/08 

season. The large increase in cost of fertilizer will result in access problems for an increased number of 

small scale farmers.

Input support for wetland production which  helps farmers practicing recession farming fill the food gap 

during the lean period (November to February), has significantly dropped in the last few years. Although 

the EU and DFID have continued to provide support to wetland production through FAO (North western 

and  Western  Provinces)  and  PAM  (Central,  Northern  and  Luapula  Provinces)  there  has  been  poor 

response to this programme.   

 

2.2.2  Crop production, Food Supply and Access 

Among  major  crops  produced,  maize  and  cassava  continue  to  rank  high  in  terms  of  output.  The 

production levels of other crops have remained significantly low.  

 

The crop estimates released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives established that Zambia has 

produced an average to below average output for major crops with the exception of cassava, wheat and 

rice whose production estimates were above the recent five-year average.  

Figure 2.1.  Maize production comparison by province

Maize  production  dropped  by  11  percent,  from  1,366,000MT  to  1,212,000MT  during  the  2007/8 

production season, but an average harvest was attained despite the adverse impact of excessive rainfall 

in the southern parts of the country.  Cassava output, which is as important as maize for the Northern, 

Luapula and Western provinces, was 10 percent above average and comparable to the previous season’s 

output  at  1,160,853MT.  The  impact  of  excessive  rainfall  on  cassava  was  minimal  as  the  highest 

producing  areas  are  mostly  in  the  northern  parts  of  the  country  where  impact  of  adverse  rainfall  was 

relatively low.   

 
Although at national level, Zambia has attained average maize production, the situation at sub-national 

level  is  mixed.  Two  of  the  high  maize  belt  areas  have  recorded  significant  drop  in  production,  namely 

Central Province (19 percent drop) and Southern Province (52 percent drop) with respect to the previous 

season and are below the five year average. Other provinces with notable drop in maize production are 

Lusaka  (51  percent),  North-Western  (14  percent)  and  Western  (13  percent).    With  the  exception  of 

North-Western, the reduction in output can mostly be attributed to the adverse rainfall which negatively 

impacted  crop  production  in  the  southern  half  of  the  country.  For  North-Western,  the  drop  was  partly 

due  to  the  26  percent  reduction  in  area  put  under  maize.  The  reduction  in  maize  output  in  southern

areas  has  partly  been  offset  by  the  increased  production  in the  northern  half  of  the  country. Increases 

were recorded in Eastern (19 percent) Northern (24 percent), Copperbelt (15 percent), and Luapula (24 

percent) compared to the 2006/07 production season.  

 

Production of rice and millet increased by 56 percent and 31 percent respectively while wheat production 

is expected to increase substantially by 56%, implying attaining almost self sufficiency level. Among the 

small grains, only sorghum has recorded a significant drop in production of 22 percent possibly due to a 

shift  towards  more  maize  production.  Cash  crops  (groundnuts,  cotton  and  burley  tobacco)  recorded 

increases  in  production  compared  to  the  previous  season,  but  these  levels  fell  short  of  the  five-year 

average.  The  large  increase  in  burley  tobacco  production  could  be  attributed  to  high  expectations  for 

tobacco prices this season. Production levels of both soybeans and Virginia tobacco remained stable.  

 

2.2.3. National Food Supply for the 2008/09 Marketing Season 

Based on data from the Ministry of Agriculture, Zambia has adequate maize stocks to meet its needs for 

the 2008/09 marketing season with a moderate surplus. The national maize surplus has been estimated 

at  143,000MT,  43  percent  below  the  250,000MT  attained  in  2007/08  season.  This  suggests  that  at

national  level,  imports  will  not  be  required.  This 

also implies that maize relief needs, in response to 

the  adverse  impact  of  the  floods  during  the 

2007/08 agricultural season, can be purchased in-

country.  Comparatively,  there  is  an  estimated  11 

percent  reduction  in  maize  availability  from  1.8 

million in 2007/08 marketing season to 1.6 million 

in  2008/09.    With  the  much  reduced  national 

surplus,  government  has  maintained  the  maize 

export  ban as  a  precautionary  measure  to  ensure 

adequate  availability  of  maize  in  country.  During 

the 2007/08 marketing season, maize in excess of 

200,000MT  was  exported 

to  neighbouring 

countries  with  118,000MT  going  to  Zimbabwe. 

Comparatively,  much  more  maize  was  exported 

during  the  2007/08  marketing  season  than  the 

two  previous  marketing  seasons.  Despite  the  imposed  export  ban,  informal  maize  and  mealie  meal 

exports have continued into Democratic Republic of Congo albeit at a much reduced rate.  

Although at national level, the food supply situation is good, there are potential problems in some parts 

of the southern half of the country, such as   Southern Province were staple food production has overall 

been reduced by half due to the excessive rainfall. In Southern Province all high producing districts have 

registered  significant  maize  production  declines  (ranging  from  35  percent  to  73  percent)  compared  to 

the  2006/07  season  and  32  percent  to  64  percent  down  with  respect  to  the  five  year  average.    With

adequate maize in country, redistribution from surplus areas to deficit areas will be key in ensuring that 

maize prices do not reach exceptionally high levels.   

 
 

 2.2.4. Food Access 

 
Maize prices which were high in April are beginning to drop significantly following the April/May harvest. 

The  price  reductions  are  generally  larger  in  rural  areas  (Figure  2.1),  due  to  reduced  reliance  on  the 

market  as  own  food  stocks  become  available.    Prices  in  May  2008  were  below  the  recent  five-year 

average,  except  in  major  flood  impacted  districts  of  Southern  Province  such  as  Mazabuka  and  Monze, 

where prices were average. 

 

In urban areas, maize  prices have also dropped, but less steeply due  to  heavy  reliance  on markets for 

staple  food  throughout  the  year.  While  maize  grain  prices  have  started  falling,  maize  meal  prices 

remained high, due to the time lag between harvest and when the new grain is dry enough for milling.  

Meal prices are expected to fall but  not to the levels of the past two seasons.  This is supported by the 

fact  that,  available  maize  stocks  are  lower  this  year,  fuel  prices  have  increased  transport  costs  while 

recent power outages have created additional costs for millers.

By  September,  maize  prices  are  expected  to  start  rising  and  thereafter  will  remain  at  relatively  high

levels  as  the  supply  of  maize  from  small  scale 

producers  declines  and  millers  shift  towards 

higher cost maize from commercial farmers.  

Anticipated  increases  in  production  costs  for 

next  year  due  to  high  fertilizer  cost,  will  also 

contribute  to  keeping  prices  high.  Generally, 

food  prices  are  on  the  increase  globally  and 

Zambia is not an exception.  

While  the  inflation  rate  had  been  declining, 

falling to 8.7 percent in November 2007 it’s now 

on  an  upward  trend  reaching  11.7  percent  in 

 

May 2008 (Figure 2.1).  This trend has resulted, 

largely from an increase in food costs.  Between 

December  2007  and  May  2008,  food  inflation 

increased by 5.8 percent, and non-food inflation 

dropped  by  1.8  percent.  Cost  of 

living 

monitoring  done  by  the  Jesuit  Center 

for 

Theological  Reflection  (JCTR)  established  that 

between  December  2007  and  May  2008,  the 

basic 

food  basket 

cost 

rose  by  30%. 

Comparatively,  the  cost  of  the  essential  non-

food  basket  only  increased  by  12%.  Although 

some  of  the  increase  in  food  costs  can  be 

attributed  to  typical  seasonal  price  fluctuations, 

continued  high  fuel  costs,  and  power  outages 

are also factors. With the  increased food prices, 

purchasing power of consumers is being eroded as income is not increasing as prices increase.   

This is worsened by the fact that poverty levels in Zambia are already high, estimated at 64 percent by 

the Central Statistics Office in 2006.   

 

2.2.5  Livestock Situation  

Livestock  production  continues  to  be  a  major  livelihood  activity  among  small  scale  farmers  in  the 

country.  Production  of  major  livestock  is  concentrated  in  the  three  provinces  of  Central,  Southern  and 

Western Provinces with cattle contributing at least 55% share of livestock, goats (35%), pigs (10%) and 

poultry and other small ruminants contributing 5%. Cattle population was estimated at 2,790,965 at the 

end of 2006 representing a 16.1% increase from the 2004 estimate.  

 

In  the  past five years  the  cattle  population  has  been  severely  reduced  by  recurring  disease  outbreaks, 

the  common  ones  being  Foot  and  Mouth  Disease  (FMD),  East  Coast  Fever  and  Contagious  Bovine 

Pleuropneumonia  (CBPP).  The  FMD  is  endemic  in  Sesheke  (Western  Province),  Kazungula  (Southern 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee – 2008                                            

14 

 
Province),  Mbala  and  Nakonde  (Northern  Province),  but  in  2004  spread  to  parts  of  Central  and  other 

Southern  Province  districts.  CBPP  is  endemic  in  areas  of  Western  Province,  North-western,  Southern 

(Kazungula)  and  part  of  Northern  Province.  East  Coast  Fever  areas  include  Eastern,  Southern,  Central, 

Lusaka and Northern Provinces. Most of the areas affected by these diseases are also prone to drought 

and  occasionally  floods.  Livestock  movement  bans  associated  with  control  measures  often  disrupt  the 

cattle enterprise associated trade, affecting farmers, beef traders and consumers of cattle products. This 

often exacerbates farmers’ vulnerability to the effects of drought/floods especially in  Southern province 

by  taking  away  the  means  to  cultivate  their  land  (draught  power)  as  well  as  one  of  the  most  reliable 

income  sources  (Tembo  et  al,  2006).  Under normal  circumstances, in  these  farming  systems,  livestock 

acts as some form of insurance against poor weather and subsequent crop failure.  

 

In the early part of 2008, following the occurrence of floods, FMD broke out in some districts of Southern 

(Monze, Namwala, Mazabuka and Itezhi tezhi) and Western provinces (Sesheke,  Senanga and Mongu). 

The outbreak  of  FMD  in  Mazabuka,  Monze  and  Namwala were  attributed  to  contact between  cattle  and 

wild game following the movement of the former from the traditional  grazing lands in the plains to the 

upland forests to escape the flooding that had occurred around February 2008. In order to control FMD 

and  stop  it  from  spreading,  government  through  the  Department  of  Livestock  and  Veterinary  Services 

imposed a ban  on the  movement  of  Livestock from  Southern and  Western provinces. It also embarked 

on vaccination of cattle in districts affected by FMD in the two provinces. So far 80,000 cattle have been 

given the first round of vaccinations in Southern province. A further 25,000 doses of FMD were recently 

purchased.  At  least  175,000  doses  of  the  exercise  would  require  to  be  further  timely  procured  to 

complete the exercise. Most of the vaccine has to be imported from outside, which results in protracted 

procurement procedures.  

 

In  a  bid  to  compliment  government  efforts  to  control  economically  important  Trans-boundary  Animal 

Diseases (TADs), such as CBPP and Anthrax in Western and North western Provinces, FAO with funding 

from the European Union assisted Government in carrying out effective vaccinations against the diseases 

from November 2007 to January 2008. As a result of the exercise, there haven’t been any new reported 

cases  of  these  disease  incidences  after  the  recent  floods.  However,  FMD  outbreak  continues  to  be  a 

problem  in  parts  of  Western  and  Southern  Provinces.  In  order  to  insure  sustained  control  of  FMD, 

resources should be made available for timely vaccinations, surveillance and diagnostic services.  

 

2.3  Water and Sanitation 

Zambia  has  vast  water  resources  in  form  of  rivers,  streams,  lakes  and  ground  water.  The  country 

generates  an  estimated  100,000m3  per  year  of  surface  water  and  an  estimated  annual  renewable 

groundwater  potential  of  49,600m3  per  year  (DWA/JICA,  1995).  Most  of  the  surface  water  is  poorly 

distributed  while  groundwater  is  fairly  well  distributed.  However,  declining  rainfall  patterns  over  the 

years have had a significant adverse impact on the country’s water resources. In terms of groundwater, 

Zambia  has  favourable  geological  conditions  for  accessing  groundwater  with  regards  to  depth,  storage 

capacity, available yields and exploitation potential.  

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee – 2008

However,  water  resource  management  has  not  succeeded  to  substantially  improve  access  to  water  or 

prevent the pollution of both surface and groundwater. Similarly, access to sanitation especially in rural 

areas is still very low.   

 

In view of these, the Government of the Republic of Zambia through its responsible Ministries of Energy 

and  Water  Development  and  Local  Government and  Housing and  stakeholders  including  private  sector, 

NGOs  and  Cooperating  Partners,  has  formulated  the  necessary  policies  and  legal  instruments  and  is 

implementing  strategies  and  programmes  aimed  at  increasing  access  to  safe  water  and  proper 

sanitation. The National Water Policy of 1994 (currently under review), Water Supply and Sanitation Act 

of 1997, the 1994 National Environmental Support Programme, the Water Resources Master Plan (1995 

to  2015),  National  Irrigation  Plan  and  the  Water  Resources  Management  Bill  give  evidence  to 

Government’s commitment to  improving the quality of  life  of  its people through  effective development, 

use and management of water resources as well as provision of proper sanitation. 

  

Furthermore,  the  Government  has  over  the  years  implemented  a  number  of  water  and  sanitation 

programmes such as the Water Resources Action Programme  (WRAP), National Rural Water Supply and 

Sanitation Programme (NRWSSP). 

 

By 2006, 58% of the population had access to improved water sources. The majority of the rural people 

access their water from rivers/lakes and unprotected wells, which are not “safe” or “improved”.  

 

The  Living  Conditions  Monitoring  Survey  Report  of  2006  states  that  access  to  improved  sanitation  in 

Zambia is 87%.  

 

2.4  Health and Nutrition 

Health is one of the major factors with significant impact on the living conditions of the population. The 

Government  of  the  Republic  of  Zambia  has  committed  itself  to  improving  the  quality  of  health  for  all 

Zambians  through  its  efforts  to  improve  health  care  delivery  by  reforming  the  health  sector.  An 

important  component  of  the  health  policy  reform  is  the  restructured  Primary  Health  Care  (PHC) 

programme, which aims to, among other things; deal with the main health problems in the community 

including  child  and  maternal  health.  Government  is  committed  to  provide  cost  effective,  quality  health 

services as close to the family as possible in order to ensure equity of access in health service delivery 

and  contribute  to  the  human  and  socio-economic  development  of  the  nation.  According  to  the  annual 

statistical  bulletin  of  2005  the  top  ten  causes  of  health  facility  visitation  were  malaria,  respiratory 

infection  (non  pneumonia),  diarrhoea  (non  bloody),  trauma,  respiratory  infections  (pneumonia),  skin 

infections,  eye  infections,  ear/nose  throat  infection,  digestive  system  (non  infection)  and  muscular 

skeletal and connective tissue.

Overall, Maternal Mortality Rates (MMR) and Under-five Mortality Rates (U-5 MR) in Zambia were among 

the  highest  in  the  region.  The  major  causes  of  child  mortality  are  malaria,  respiratory  infection, 

diarrhoea, malnutrition and anaemia (including HIV and AIDS) while maternal mortality is largely due to 

obstetric  causes  such  as  postpartum  haemorrhage,  sepsis,  obstructed 

labour,  post-abortion 

complications  and  eclampsia.  Malaria,  anaemia  and  HIV  and  AIDS  also  contribute  significantly  to  high 

MMR. 

 

Other contributing factors include delays in accessing healthcare at community and health center levels. 

Although  90%  of  all  pregnant  women  receive  some  kind  of  antenatal  care,  only  43%  deliver  in  health 

facilities.  The  Total  Fertility  Rate  (TFR)  according  to  the  Zambia  Demographic  Health  Survey  (ZDHS) 

2001-2002 has been decreasing slowly but still remains high.  Access to family planning services is a key 

determinant  for  TFR.  In  this  respect,  the  use  of  modern  contraceptives  accessed  through  the  public 

health  sector  play  a  critical  role.    The  literacy  levels  among  women  were  reported  to  be  low  48.9%  in 

rural areas n urban areas compared to 70%   

 

The national level of malnutrition status is high and is a major public health concern in Zambia. The key 

attributes being high poverty  levels,  increase in food  insecurity and sub-optimal  infant and young child 

feeding practices.  

 

The  pattern  of  infant  feeding  has  an  impact  on  both  the  child  and  mother.  Feeding  practices  are  the 

principal determinants of child’s nutritional status. Breast-feeding as one of the child feeding strategies is 
universal  in Zambia, although exclusive Breast-feeding1 for the first six months is not widely practiced. 

The  Global  strategy  for  infant  and  young  child  feeding  adapted  by  Zambia,  recommends  that  the  child 

should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life. Exclusive breastfeeding plays an important 

role in child survival. Poor nutritional status in young children exposes them to greater risks of morbidity 

and mortality.  

 

HIV  prevalence  in  the  general  population  still  remain  high  although  the  prevalence  rates  in  the  15-49 

years  population  showed  a  decrease    (14%  )  in    the  ZDHS  2007  from  15.6%  in  2002.    At  provincial 

level, the ZDHS 2007 records Lusaka as the highest with HIV prevalence at 20.8% followed by Central 

with 18 %. The lowest level of HIV prevalence was recorded in Northern Province with 6.8 percent. HIV 

prevalence is still high (26 %) among females aged 30-34, while the prevalence in males was high in the 

age group 40-44 (24.1%). 

 

In  response  to  this  situation,  various  child  health  interventions/strategies  are  being  implemented  to 

reduce  under-five  mortality  rates.  These  include  infant  and  young  child  feeding  promotions,  growth 

monitoring promotion, micro nutrient control and management of severe malnutrition, immunization and 

management of common childhood illnesses.  Immunization coverage in Zambia  is higher than in most 

                                                            
1 Exclusive breastfeeding; feeding the baby on breast milk only without giving water or any other foods.

Sub-Saharan African countries, with coverage rates for measles, DPT3 and polio in the range of 80-85% 

and BCG at above 90% of the eligible populations.   

 

Despite  inadequate  coverage  of  such  effective  interventions  and  the  poor  quality  of  services  provided, 

especially  in  the  rural  areas  due  to  the  critical  shortage  of  skilled  staff,  weak  infrastructure  and 

inadequate funding for child health interventions, there has been marked downward trend in U-5 MR.  It 

is  envisaged  that  during  the  life  of  the  strategic  action  plan,  child  health  and  nutrition  will  be  a  key 

agenda item. 

 

The  challenge  for  the  health  sector  is  to  accelerate  and  scale  up  implementation  of  effective  child 

survival interventions, targeting the high risk areas such as the flood affected districts.  Child health and 

nutrition  programs  and  strategies  include  immunization,  management  of  childhood  infections,  and 

management  of  the  new  born,  nutrition  support  and  promotion  and  strengthening  of  school  health 

programmes.  

 

Several interventions were implemented in this area including, the strengthening of reproductive health 

services  through  stronger  referral  systems  e.g.  provision  of  transport,  integration  of  prevention  of 

mother  to  child  transmission  (PMTCT)  in  Reproductive  Health,  improvements  in  adolescent  health, 

promotion  of positive  male  involvement,  improved  co-ordination  and  collaboration  between  actors,  and 

procurement  of  equipment  and  drug  supplies  for  essential  obstetric  care  in  all  the  72  districts, 

integration  of  management  of  abortions  with  infection  prevention  techniques  and  family  planning 

counselling  and  provision.  Effective  partnerships  such  as  safe  motherhood  committees  at  community 

level and UN agencies, Cooperating Partners and NGOs were established.  All these efforts contributed to 

the  increase  in  the  number  of  supervised  deliveries  from  44%  in  2001  to  55%  in  2003,  these  figures 

include deliveries supervised by Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs).   

 

The main constraints affecting integrated reproductive health (IRH) include:  the slow pace in developing 

policies,  which  limits  implementation  of  some  interventions;  shortage  of  appropriate  personnel;  poor 

transport and communication facilities; social-cultural factors, such as the belief that seeking care early 

in  labour  is  a  sign  of  weakness;  delays  in  reaching  facilities  due  to  long  distances;  inadequate 

infrastructure  such  as  space,  lighting,  lack  of  privacy  in  some  facilities;  and  inadequacy  of  drugs  and 

other  essential  equipment  and  also  lack  of  proper  Emergency  Obstetric  Care  (EmOC)  facilities.    These 

factors contribute to delays in providing care at the facilities and consequently contribute to problems of 

unsupervised deliveries. 

 

The  challenge  for  the  Ministry  is  to  scale  up  the  delivery  of  services  and  the  demand  for  key  services 

among  the  population  within  the  limited  resources  that  are  currently  available.    There  is  an  acute 

shortage  of  skilled  births  attendants,  transport,  supplies  and  data  collecting  systems,  maternity  wings 

that offer EmOC at both primary and referral levels, which adversely affects emergency obstetrics. There 

is also need to build and strengthen partnership for better coordination to address EmOC issues.

Efforts  are  needed  to  change  health  seeking  behaviour,  including  socio-cultural  factors  which  lead  to 

delays in seeking health care and poor nutrition.  The quality of services also needs to improve: constant 

delays  in  the  provision  of  care  leads  to  low  use  of  health  facilities  and  results  in  an  increase  of 

unsupervised deliveries and in poor quality of antenatal care. 

 
2.5 
 
The Education system in Zambia consists of academic learning at primary, secondary and tertiary levels. 

Education  

However, the lower levels, i.e. pre-university is currently being reorganized into two levels, namely Basic 

education,  running  form  grades  1  to  9  and  high  school  running  from  grade  10  to  12.    The  Ministry  of 

Education  has  also  been  mandated  to  run  Early  Childhood  Care,  Development  and  Education  (ECCDE). 

The main policy documents guiding the Ministry’s education provision are the 1996 policy of “Educating 

our future” and the Fifth National development Plan, 2006 to 2010. 

  

Zambia  has  8,013  schools  classified  as  basic,  583  schools  classified  as  secondary,  14  colleges  of 

education and 3 public universities (Education statistics bulletin 2007). 

 

Additionally there are 2,716 community schools. Community schools  are those  initiated and  run by the 

community with minimal support from the government. The total school enrolment for grades 1 to 9 in 

2006 was 2, 986, 781 while  in 2007 it was 3, 166,310 representing an increase of 6%. The enrolment 

for grades 10 to 12 in 2006 was 193, 843 while in 2007 it was 219,132 representing an increase of 13%.  

It is important to note that there has been a marked increase in enrolment at grade one level due to the 

introduction  of  free  primary  education  and  improvement  in  quality  of  school  buildings.    The  number  of 

out of school children has been declining since 2000. According to the 2007 Education Statistics bulletin, 

the  number  of  out  of  school  children  in  the  7-18  years  age  group  were  65,  185  males  and  173,  380 

females representing 6.7 % of the total population.  

 

The  Ministry  of  Education  has  categorized  infrastructure  in  three  categories  namely  permanent 

structures,  temporary  and  incomplete. The  permanent structures are  structures  built  to  last,  usually  at 

high  cost  using  skilled  labour.  The  temporary  structures  are  temporal  in  nature  built  as  stop  gap 

measure  to  provide  basic  infrastructure.  The  incomplete  structures  are  designed  to  be  permanent 

structures but are still under construction. 

 

At  basic  school  level,  as  of  2007,  there  were  26,546  permanent  and  8,132  temporal  classrooms.  At 

secondary  level,  there  were  7,292  permanent  and  193  temporal  classrooms.    The  number  of  temporal 

classrooms  accounted  for  23.5  %  at  basic  school  level  and  2.6%  at  secondary  level.  The  majority  of 

community schools are  made of pole and mud, making them more susceptible to damage from natural 

induced hazards such as floods.

Protection  

 
2.6 
 
Protection  issues  during  emergency  relate  largely  to  sexual  and  gender  based  violence,  defilement, 

sodomy,  physical  and  emotional  abuse  of  children  and  women.  These  are  normally  expected  to 

accelerate  due  to  the  stress  caused  as  a  result  of  the  change  in  environment  as  well  as  systems  that 

guard  against  abuse.  In  Zambia,  these  are  all  issues  that  occur  during  normal  periods  in  families  and 

communities. This is the reason why there is need to maximise protection systems that prevent and deal 

with protection during emergency situations. 

 

More  so,  Sexual  and  Gender  Based-Violence,  including  rape,  sodomy  and  defilement,  is  a  common 

problem  throughout  the  world.  It  occurs  in  every  society,  country  and  region.  This  problem  has  been 

identified  throughout  history  but  has  been  a  neglected  issue  in  many  societies.  Without  appropriate 

intervention  sexual  and  gender  based  violence,  particularly  sexual  assault,  continues  and  escalates  in 

frequency and severity. Many victims may have suffered long-established patterns of abuse by the time 

the problem is identified. The consequences of sexual assault include infection with Sexually Transmitted 

Infections  (STIs)  including  infection  with  the  Human  Immune  Deficiency  Virus  (HIV).  The  women 

survivors  may  also  have  unwanted  pregnancies  which  may  end  up  in  unsafe  abortions  if  not  properly 

attended to. The survivors may also suffer psychological trauma of varying magnitude. Early intervention 

may help prevent cases of sexual assault. This can be done through community sensitization, advocacy, 

legal  reform,  but  above  all  survivors  of  sexual  assault  require  appropriate  medical  management  and 

rehabilitation.  Health  care  providers  are  better  placed  to  provide  survivors  with  comprehensive  care 

including referral to appropriate community organizations providing support. 

 

Children  in  Zambia  have  over  the  last  years  been  prone  to  defilement,  early  marriages,  child  labour, 

neglect leading to some children becoming street children.  A number of factors have been identified as 

contributing  to  lack  of  respect  and  fulfilment  of  the  rights  of  children  and  women  in  Zambia.  These 

include  inadequate  participation  of  children  in  the  formal  school  system;  inadequate  legislation  and 

enforcement  on  gender  violations  against  children  and  women;  Poverty  status  of  their  parents/and  or 

guardians;  Lack  of  clarity  on  the  part  of  parents  and  guardians  in  relation  to  their  legitimate 

responsibility  to  discipline  a  child,  and  what  to  define  as  child  abuse  and  fear  of  departing  from 

traditional norms, practices and expectations. 

 

Zambia is a signatory to the convention on the rights of the child and has made strides in ensuring the 

realization of these rights. The country also recognizes the existence of the African Charter on the Rights 

of a child. Further, in 2004, The UN Secretary General commissioned a Global study on violence against 

children  in  which  Zambia  participated.  The  study  came  up  with  12  recommendations  that  are  being 

implemented globally and as expected Zambia recognizes its role in this response. However, despite the 

many strides that have been made in ensuring that children are protected, Zambia’s children continue to 

experience violations on their rights.

Additionally, Zambia is a signatory to a number of conventions on women’s rights such as the convention 

on elimination against all forms of discrimination against women. Notwithstanding Zambia’s commitment 

to  international  conventions,  there  are  still  high  incidences  of  abuse  of  women  bordering  on  physical, 

sexual  and reproductive  rights,  stereotypic  gender roles and  inheritance  rights.  Of  these  abuses sexual 

exploitation and abuse are the most common.   

 
2.7 

Infrastructure  

Development of infrastructure is one of the key poverty reduction mechanisms that the government has 

put  in  place  to  contribute  towards  improving  the  living  conditions  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable 

communities. In  most  of  the  rural  areas  government  in collaboration  with  co-operating  partners set  up 

institutions  such  as  the  Zambia  Social  Investment  Fund  and  the  Micro  Projects  Unit  to  undertake 

community based infrastructure development projects. According to the LCMS 2004 the most widespread 

infrastructure  projects  in  the  rural  areas  are  rehabilitation/resurfacing  of  roads,  provision  and 

improvement of education infrastructure and health facilities. 

 

About  80%  of  the  country  depends  on  gravel  and  feeder  roads  connecting  districts  and  wards  to  each 

other. This is a vital and strategic link for the supply of goods and services to the communities in various 

parts of the country.  

Government has encouraged the establishment of schools and health centres in the rural areas through 

community development programmes such as rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. However, most of 

the infrastructure especially in the educational sector remains in a poor state as most community schools 

are built from pole and mud.   

 

 

2.7.1  Human Settlement and shelter 

Human  settlement  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  country’s  socio-economic  recovery  programme  aimed  at 

improving  the  well  being  of  the  Zambian  people.  Although  housing  is  a  basic  necessity  for  humans,  of 

the total housing stock in Zambia eighty percent could be classified as informal in nature (Vision 2030, P 

10).  About  65  percent  of  Zambian  households  occupy  traditional  housing  units  (LCMS,  2004).  In  rural 

areas, 91 percent occupy traditional housing compared with only 22 percent in urban areas. 

 

Further,  due  to  the  livelihood  patterns  of  some  communities  such  as  fishing,  livestock  rearing  and 

wetland  agriculture,  some  houses  are  built  along  the  river  banks  where  such  livelihood  activities  are 

carried out. Such locations coupled with the inappropriate and weak building materials (chiefly pole, mud 

and grass) used in building the shelters only worsens the vulnerability of these structures to heavy rains 

and floods.

3.0 FINDINGS 
 

A total of 39 districts were covered during the In-Depth Assessment and of these, 81% were rural. The 

findings were as follows; 

 
3.1 FOOD SECURITY 
 

3.1.1 Household Characteristics  

The majority (76%) of household heads were married while a smaller number (12%) were widowed and 

the  rest  were  single,  separated  or  divorced.  Most  of  the  household  heads  were  in  the  productive  age 

group of 20 to 39 years (53%) and 40 years to 59 years (33%) respectively.

The elderly headed households (60 years and 

above)  were  quite  significant  representing 

about  16%  of  the  households  and  most  of 

whom  are  widowed  (13.6  %),  while  child 

headed 

household 

were 

insignificant 

comprising  only 1%. The family size for most 

households  was  between  5  to  6  members, 

which is in line with the findings of the Living 

Conditions  Monitoring  Survey  (LCMS,  2004) 

and  findings  from  the  2007  VAC  assessment. 

48%

The  assessment  also  revealed  that  household 

heads  had  diverse  educational  levels.  The 

majority  have  primary  education  (55%). 

Furthermore,  63%  of 

the  spouses  had 

attained primary education. About 14% of the 

sampled  households 

indicated  having  an 

orphan in their households and of these, 98% 

had  one  orphan.  72%  of 

the  sampled 

households  indicated  having  at  least  one 

                                         Source: 2008 In-depth 

under five child.  

 

The majority of the households in rural areas use firewood (74%) and charcoal (18%) for cooking while 

use of electricity is extremely low. Similarly, the use of electricity for lighting is very low with households 

mostly  using  kerosene  (42%)  and  candles  (33%).  This  could  be  attributed  to  the  poor  access  to 

electricity in the rural areas.  

 

3.1.2 Household Food Security  

 
The  assessment  established  that  Southern  and  Lusaka  Provinces  recorded  significant  decline  in  maize 

production. The decline in maize production for Lusaka was averaging about 56.25% as compared to last 

year’s production while that of Southern Province averaged about 48.8%. The declines were attributed to 

several factors some of which were floods, lack of inputs and inadequate labour.

Excessive  rains  in  December  2007  and  January  2008  resulted  in  floods  and water  logging which  led  to 

extensive  leaching  of  soil  nutrients  while  reducing  time  for  farm  operations  such  as  planting,  weeding 

and  fertiliser  application.  Consequently,  crop  performance  was  adversely  affected  resulting  in  reduced 

Figure 3.1.2: Reasons for cultivating less area 

yields.  

 

 

 

Figure 3.1.3: Arable Land Cultivated During 2007/8 Season 

Most  of  the  households  (80.3%)  indicated 

that  they  had  access  to  arable  land  (back 

yard  or  field).  Of  these  that  had  indicated 

having access,  a  good  number  had  cultivated 

between 0.5ha and 1ha (31%). A further 28% 

indicated  having  had  cultivated  less  than 

0.5ha of the arable land, while 20% and 19% 

cultivated  2ha or  more  and  between  1ha  and 

2ha respectively.  

 

 

 

 

The  Assessment 

indicated 

that  74,104 

households  would  require  some  assistance. 

Most  of  the  affected  households  (43.2%)  are 

dependent  on  farming  as  their  main  source  of 

livelihood. Loss of crops due to floods therefore 

entails  loss  of  production  capacity,  making  it 

difficult  for  affected  households  to  purchase 

agricultural  inputs  such  as  seed  and  fertiliser 

for 

the  coming  planting  season.  These 

households  would  require  assistance  to  restore 

their  production  capacity.  It  is  expected  that 

the  majority  of  them  would  be  able  to  benefit 

from 

the  government  supported  Fertiliser 

Support Programme and the Food Security Pack 

programme.

3.2.1.1 Contribution to Own Production Maize Equivalent and Other Means to Total Maize 

Most households had continued to diversify in crop production for purposes of food security and income 

generation. Results from the in-depth vulnerability assessment indicated that most households continued 

to grow maize as the major food crop (87.6%) while 26.5% grew cassava (Figure 3.1.4).  

 

The contribution of own production to household staple consumption stood at 87.6% with the remaining 

coming from other sources such as purchases, remittances and gifts. 

  Figure 3.1.4: Production of Staple Crops by Households   

 
The assessment revealed that 

although  the  households  had 

diverse 

livelihoods, 

own 

production  still  remains  a 

dominant source of the staple 

food.  Contribution  of  own 

food 

to  household  staple 

consumption  made  up  about 

88%  while 

the 

remaining 

12% 

came 

from 

other 

sources  such  as  purchases, 

remittances and gifts. 

 
The  dominance  of  own  production  in  most  rural  households,  as  was  the  case  in  the  2007  assessment, 

entails  that  such  households  are  likely to  be  food insecure  emanating  from  hazards  such  as floods  and 

droughts. Production in 80% of the assessed districts (30 out of 39) was below that recorded last season 

with  the  worst  hit  districts  such  as 

Namwala 

recording 

production 

reduction of 68%.  

 

The  reduction  in  the  yields  during  the 

2007/8 season was generally attributed 

to ponding in the fields in most districts 

and  floods  in  some  parts  of  Southern 

Province. The impact of the heavy rains 

on  harvests  for  most  households  was 

considerable  implying  a  reduction  in 

availability  and  accessibility  of  the 

staple to most of these households.

3.1.3 Livelihoods 
 

3.1.3.1 Income Sources 

The  In-Depth  Vulnerability  and  Needs  Assessment  revealed  that  the  major  income  sources  for  most  of 

the  rural  households  include  cash/food  crop  production,  casual  labour  and  petty  trading  as  the  three 

most common activities (figure 3.1.3.1).  Other sources of income include casual labour, small business 

and petty trading.

3.1.3.2 Expenditure Pattern 

Expenditure on food and household items in the surveyed households was high accounting for about 

(70%) of the households’ earnings. Expenditure on key elements such as education and health remain 

significantly low standing at 10%. 

 

The assessment further established that the male-headed household dominated the expenditure pattern 

with  an  average  of  over  65%  male-headed  household  spending  more  than  the  female  headed 

households (Figure 3.1.3.2).

communities indicated that they expected to run out of own-produced foods by August 2008 barely two 

months after the completion of harvesting. 

 

It was evident from the Income source calendar that the surveyed communities had diverse sources of 

income.  These  ranged  from  petty  trading/small  businesses  to  labour  exchanges.  These  activities  are 

intensified  just  after  completion  of  harvest  in  June  and  run  until  the  beginning  of  land  preparations  in 

August/September. In communities that were near big towns, migration of labour was also evident. 

 
 

 

3.1.3.4 Coping Strategies 

The assessment findings indicate that most of the households had a maximum of three meals a day 

(46.4%), while 45.6% reduced their meals per day to two (2) as a coping strategy (Figure3.1.3.4).

Households also employed income strategies to supplement consumption and expenditure strategies. It 

 

was reviewed that most households  (30.9%)  had additional  household members to  find casual work to 

get  food  or  money  to  buy  food.  17.8%  had  a  member  entering  the  IGA  sector  for  the  first  time  while 

12.5% sold more than usual amount of livestock/poultry. Other household (8.6%) sold household assets 

to buy food with only 4.1% indicating having had to sell productive assets such as hoes and ploughs to 

buy food. 

3.1.4  Market Situation 

Towards the end of the 2007/08 marketing season (in April), maize prices maintained their high levels in 

most markets as a result of low supply. In the thirty-nine (39) assessed districts, maize prices were high 

in the low producing districts of Sinazongwe, Shangombo, Kalabo, Lukulu, Zambezi, Mambwe and Mongu 

whose prices were above K1,200/Kg. Sinazongwe particularly reported abnormally high prices even for a 

low  producing  district  of  K1,900/Kg,  an  indication  of  a  possible  shortage.    Among  the  high  producing 

districts,  only  Mumbwa  reported  high  maize  prices  of  K1280/Kg,  an  indication  of  significant  supply 

reduction.  

 

Compared to April 2007, almost all assessed districts with the exception of Mpulungu and Isoka recorded 

price increases with Sinazongwe, Namwala, Mazabuka, Mumbwa and Sesheke recording price increments 

of over 70%. The prices in Sinazongwe increased exceptionally high, more than twice that of April 2007. 

Other  notable  areas  with  high  price  increases  of  at  least  60%  were  in  Monze,  Itezhi  tezhi,  Kafue  and 

Mansa.  Important  to  note  is  that  normally,  prices  in  April  either  remain  stable  or  start  decreasing 

depending on the harvest expectation.

The high  price  levels  in  April  this year  were partly  an  indication  of expectation  of  reduced  harvest, but 

more  so  the  reflection  of  the  low  supply  of  maize  on  the  market  as  the  new  harvest  was  not  yet 

available. To a certain  extent, it also shows that in April there weren’t adequate early foods then as to 

reduce demand for the maize on the market in districts exhibiting very high prices.  The true reflection of 

the maize market situation for the new marketing season is best reflected in May and not the month of 

April  as most  harvesting  of maize  starts end  of  April  into  May.  April  prices  best  reflects  the  end  of the 

previous  markets  stocks  on  the  market  and  partially  extent  to  which  households  are  accessing  early 

foods.

Most of the districts whose maize prices rose significantly are also major livestock rearing areas. Cattle 

prices  in  almost  all  assessed  districts  which  are  major  livestock  keeping  areas  rose  significantly  with 

respect  to  the  month  of  December.  Among  the  assessed  districts,  only  Mpulungu  and  Isoka  registered 

moderate price drops. The fact that prices in most districts rose suggests that there was no desperation 

for households to sell off their cattle at low prices as they were able to negotiate for higher prices. The 

highest cattle price increases were recorded in Sinazongwe, Mumbwa, Mazabuka, Namwala and Sesheke 

which were among districts with significant increase in maize prices. This also shows that at the time of 

the assessment in April, the impact of the livestock ban movement for Southern Province due to the foot 

and mouth disease outbreak had not yet started reducing income for farmers.     

 

Generally,  although  maize  prices  have  increased  in  comparison  to  the  same  period  in  2007,  the  price 

levels  did  not  reflect  the  post  harvest  situation  as  the  harvesting  of  most  of  the  maize  had  not  been 

done.  However,  it  does  show  that  in  most  of  these  areas  with  high  prices,  early  foods  may  have  been 

reduced due to the flood impact. The cattle prices were also showing  significant  increases compared to 

the lean period (December). This shows that at the time of the assessment, there were no desperation 

sales.

3.1.5 Food Needs 

 
The In-Depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment findings established that of the 39 districts surveyed, 

21  would  require  food  assistance  for  Nine  (9)  months  (July,  2008  –  March,  2009)  while  seven  (7) 

districts would be placed under monitoring from now until the next harvest (refer to Annex 3). The total 

cereal requirements for the 21 districts requiring food assistance amount to 33, 333 Metric tonnes (See 

Annex 4 for the break down).

The analysis of malnutrition prevalence by age group reveals that the 6 to 29 months present a much 

higher risk of malnutrition.  

         

3.2.1.3. Chronic malnutrition 

The  survey  also  estimated  prevalence  of  stunting  (low  height-for-age),  which  reflects  chronic 

malnutrition,  and  underweight  (low  weight-for-age)  which  reflect  both  acute  and  chronic  malnutrition 

(see Table 3.2.4).

The analysis of mortality rates was based on an individual for whose complete information was recorded. 

This  included  children  aged  between  0  to  59  months  and  individuals  who  had  moved  but  alive  and/or 
living elsewhere. The recall period was 6 months, from (1st January 2008). The survey recorded CMR and 

U5MR as shown in the table below.   

Tables 3.2.6 – Mortality Rates

U5MR(Death in under five/10,000 U5 children / day:  1.18 ( 0.02 – 2.34) 95% CI) 

 
The  result  is  expressed  per  10,000-people  /  day.    Both  CMR  and  U5MR  were  below  the  emergency 

thresholds of 1 and 2 respectively.

from  Fever/suspected  malaria,  diarrhoea  (watery  stool),  ARI/Cough,  or  skin  infection  while  37.6%  did 

not suffer from any illness. 

Health  facilities  were  the  most  commonly  (44.4%)  used  health  care  services  in  all  the  39  districts, 

followed  by  self  treatment  (7%).    The  assessment  further  established  that  44.4%  of  those  that  report

3.2.3. Vaccination and micronutrient supplementation 

 

 

 
Overall  the  assessment  recorded  high  immunization  coverage  among  all  the  eligible  children.  The 

measles  coverage  of  96.2  %  was  recorded  among  children  aged  between  9-59  months,  98.7%  was 

recorded for OPV and DPT immunization while the BCG coverage was found to be at 97.6%. The health 

card (61.7%) and verbal history provided by the caregiver (34.5%) were the main source of information 

for child immunization. A small percentage (0.3%) of the eligible children did not receive vaccines while

3.5%  of the child caretakers did not know whether the child  had been immunized or  not. In 2007, the 

rate of measles vaccination uptake was found to be 73% Vitamin A coverage. 

  

Vitamin A is an essential micronutrient because any deficiency implies that restoration will take several 

months to be done. The more serious manifestations of vitamin A deficiency include impaired vision that 

can lead to blindness. The Vitamin A supplementation coverage from this assessment was slightly lower 

than the coverage recorded from the 2007 in-depth as well as 80% national target. This was attributed 

to  logistical  constraints  faced  by  the  districts  to  access  some  flood  affected  areas  and  also  inadequate 

health personnel. The table below shows the overall vitamin A coverage from the assessed areas.

3.2.5.1. Child Caregivers 

This  survey  was  not  specifically  designed  to  investigate  the  care  and  feeding  practices  of  infants  and 

young  children.  In  order  to  assist  in  interpreting  nutritional  findings,  questions  regarding  child  care 

practices  for  under-five  children  were  included.  Overall,  the  primary  caregiver  for  most  of  the  children 

under-five  in  the  assessed  districts  was  the  mother  (83%)    The  remaining  17  %  were  cared  for  by 

sister/brothers  (4%),  grandparents  (11%)  or  other  family  members  (2%).Grandmothers  serve  an 

important  role  in  caring  for  the  child.  There  may  be  traditional  practices  which  might  potentially  be 

detrimental  to  the  health  and  development  of  the  child  but  nutrition  education  campaigns  may  benefit 

this particular group. 

 

3.2.5.2. Breastfeeding Practices 

Breastfeeding  status  was  based  on  maternal  recall.  At  the  time  of  the  assessment,  80.1%  of  mothers 

were  still  breastfeeding  a  child.  Breastfeeding  among  children  below  6  months  of  age  was  very  high

(98.9)  in  all the  thirty-nine  (39) districts.  However,  (86.7)  %  of  breastfed  children  were  also  receiving 

fluids and/or semi solid foods.  

 

3.2.5.3. Breastfeeding and micronutrient supplementation of pregnant women  

Overall; 133,134 (15.1%) mothers of children 6 to 59 months of age in the sample were pregnant at the 

time of the survey. Less than half of all mothers (36.5%) were still breastfeeding a child at the time of 

the survey. Vitamin A supplementation, within 8 weeks following the birth of their last child was reported 

by 63.2% women.  

 

Iron-folate  supplementation  during  pregnancy  was  more  common  and  reported  by  56.8%  of  all  the 

surveyed  women  while  43.2%  never  took  the  supplement.  Table  3.2.10  Shows  the  percentage  of 

reasons why Iron-folate was not taken.

Malnourished children were significantly more likely to have been sick during the two weeks prior to the 

assessment  compared  to  the  non-malnourished  p  <  0.005.  There  was  a  strong  relationship  between 

children suffering from Fever/suspected malaria and being wasted, 33.4% of the malnourished children 

had suffered from Fever/suspected malaria  in the two weeks prior to the survey  (p<0.005). However, 

21%  of  the  children  in  the  survey  reported  Fever/suspected  malaria  whose  association  may  be  a 

reflection  of  high  prevalence.  Fever/suspected  malaria  was  self-reported  by  the  caregiver  and  not 

clinically verified as the survey did not record cases of diagnosed malaria separately. 

 

The average  weight  for  height,  height  for  age  and  weight for age  Z-score  were  significantly  associated 

with having suffered from watery diarrhoea in the two weeks prior to the survey (p < 0.005), 16.8% of 

children  who  had  diarrhoea  were  acutely  malnourished,  compared  to  83.2%  who  had  diarrhoea.  The 

same  was  observed  for  cough  (p<0.005)  with  wasting  prevalence  of  18.6%  among  children  who  had 

suffered from cough. Since chronic malnutrition is a long-term process, the recent bout of illness was not 

directly related to stunting and underweight.

3.2.6. Relationship between nutritional status and source of water 

Wasting  (mean  weight  for  height  Z-score)  was  significantly  associated  with  the  type  of  drinking  water 

source  (p<  0.005).  Wasting  prevalence  was  10.9  %  for  those  consuming  water  from  a  safe  source 

(Borehole, piped water and protected deep well) and 89.1 % for those using unsafe sources. 

 

3.2.7. Relationship between nutritional status and type of latrine 

There was a slight association (p < 0.005) between wasting and the type of latrines used by households 

(significant  at  based  on  mean  Z-score).  The  prevalence  of  wasting  in  households  using  traditional 

latrines was 13% compared to 12% with improved latrines. 

 

3.3  WATER AND SANITATION 

 

3.3.1. Water 

 
In  this  survey  “access  to  clean  and  safe  drinking  water”  was  considered  the  same  as  “access  to  an 

improved water source”. Boreholes and protected sources were regarded as safe sources while rivers or 

lakes and unprotected sources were considered unsafe.  

 

3.3.1.1. 

Drinking Water at Community level 

 
As  the  first  common  source  in  three,  44.2%  of  the  communities  draw  water  from  unprotected  water 

sources  as  their  main  water  source  with  58.7%,  54.3%  being  second  and  third  respectively.  This 

indicates  that  majority  of  the  communities  affected  by  the  flood  will  require  new  water  points  to  be 

constructed  but  the  need  is  much  higher  when  you  consider  communities  that  draw  from  unprotected 

sources but were not affected by the floods. It is therefore expected that these will be catered for within 

the routine sector plans. 49% of the communities had over 50% of their main water sources affected by 

the floods with only 8.5% having between 10 to 29% of their main sources being affected. See figure 

below 3.3.1.1.

Generally  61.9%  of  the  communities  perceive  their  water  quality  for  domestic  purposes  to  be  poor. 

There is need to provide adequate chlorine as required for the communities that have been affected by 

the floods. 

 

3.3.1.2. 

Drinking Water at Household 

About 38% of households obtain their water from unprotected sources such as unprotected shallow wells 

and/or rivers/streams that are highly susceptible to faecal contamination as a result of flooding. It was 

also evident that most of the households used boreholes, piped water and unprotected shallow wells as 

their  main  sources  of  drinking  water  (see  figure  below).  Boreholes  were  ranked  first  in  terms  of  major 

sources  of  drinking  water  (32.6%)  and  piped  water  second  (18.1).  the  least  prevalent  water  source  is 

the protected spring (0.3%).

About  28.9%  of  households  treated  their  water.  The  major  treatment  method  employed  by  most 

households  is  through  the  use  of  chlorine.  The  use  of  chlorine  is  ranked  first  at  75%  and  boiling  is 

second at 23%. The treatment of drinking water in the districts is broken down as follows:

3.3.1.3. 

Comparison of main drinking water source with diarrhoea 
prevalence 

 
The data shows that households drawing water from rivers or lakes had the highest occurrence of 

diarrhoea at 30.5% and the least occurrence was amongst households that drew their water from 

protected springs. See figure 3.3.1.5 below.

In cases of diarrhoea occurrence in households collecting water from protected sources, and that 

protected water sources are considered to be relatively clean and safe, the contamination of water could 

have occurred during handling e.g., through poor hygiene practice at household level. 

 

3.3.2. Sanitation 

 
In this report sanitation access is regarded as access to improved sanitation based on the United Nations 

(2003) definition of “improved sanitation”. This definition assumes that facilities such as septic tank 

system, pour flush latrines, simple pit or ventilated improved pit latrines are likely to be adequate, 

provided that they are not public as stated in the Millennium Development Goals Zambia Status Report 

of 2005. The Living Conditions Monitoring Survey of 2006 indicates that 87% of households have access 

to proper sanitary facilities in Zambia. 

 
According to the survey, despite water and soap being available in the majority (72.2%) of the 

households visited, a large number (over 65.6%) of them do not wash their hands with soap before 

preparing food, eating and after using the toilets/latrine. 

21% of the population has no sanitary facilities; while 69.3% of those that have use traditional pit 

latrines and 5.3% have access to flush toilets. See figure 3.3.2.1 below.

78.3%  of  the  communities  use  sanitary  facilities.  The  most  commonly  used  sanitary  facility  in  the 

 

communities is the traditional pit latrine (70.6%), followed by communities using flush toilets (4.1%). Of 

all the communities using adequate sanitary facilities, over 60% of the communities indicated that over 

50% of their facilities were affected by the floods and only 13% of the communities indicated less than 

10% of the facilities being affected.

3.4 EDUCATION 
 
3.4.1  Education Levels 
 
On  average  about  51%  of  the  household  heads  have  undergone  primary  school  education  but  the 

majority  failed  to  make  it  into  secondary  school  (only  31%  attained  secondary  education)  (Figure  22). 

12%  of  the  spouses  have  never  been  to  school  whereas  45%  have  attained  primary  education.  Only 

18% of the spouses attained secondary level of education.

Education Level of HHLD

 
The level of education of the household head has a bearing on the number of school drop outs as shown 

 

in figure 21. The results show that 10% of drop outs (6% males and 4% females) were from households 

headed  by  those  who  had  never  been  to  school  at  all;  46%  of  the  drop  outs  (27%  males  and  19 

females) were from families headed by someone with primary level of education; 42% (21% males and 

21% females) were from families headed by those who attained secondary education and The number of 

drop outs from households headed by those with tertiary education level was negligible at 1%. This was 

a very interesting result that needed further investigations because one would expect the group with the 

highest number of drop outs to appreciate the value of education more than the rest so as to encourage 

their children to go school.

3.4.2  School Attendance 
 

The survey established there was a reduction in school attendance due to school drop outs. Incidences of 

male drop  out were 5% while female drop  outs were 4%. There  were three main reasons for dropping 

out of school; namely inability of the families to afford school requirements, lack of interest in school and 

early pregnancies.  According to the survey, 76% (44% males and 32% females) of the children dropped

out  because  the  family  could  not  afford  to  meet  their  school  requirements,  15%  (8%  males  and  7% 

females) dropped out because of lack of interest in school and 7% (all females) drop out of school due to 

pregnancies.  The  other  reasons  for  dropping  out  of  school  such  as:  work  for  food/cash;  care  for  sick 

family member; hunger; and collapsed school were insignificant at 2%.  

 

There  were  more  school  drop  outs  due  to  families  not  being  able  to  afford  school  requirements,  at 

secondary  level  than  primary  level,  because  at  primary  level  the  free  education  policy  applies.  The 

assessment also established that school attendance reduced from lower to higher education.  

 

The results of assessment further showed that few children (about 2%) dropped out of school because of 

collapsed  school  buildings,  as  a  result  of  the  floods  experienced.  Furthermore,  in  some  of  the  flood 

affected areas the school children shifted to the higher and drier lands where they continued with their 

education.  

 

In other areas the learning process continued in make shift structures and/or other community centres. 

However,  this  was  not  conducive  for  learning  and  the  quality  of  education  was  compromised. 

Furthermore the relocation to the drier lands and alternative learning environments, took away valuable 

learning time from the school children.

3.4.3 Household Expenditure on Education 

The  assessment  established  that  in  all  the  districts  surveyed  a  total  of  12%  of  the  households 

interviewed reported a reduction of overall expenditure on education costs as shown in figure 3.4.2. This 

shows  a  reduction  of  8%  from  the  figure  of  20%  reported  in  the  2007  report.  A  total  of  86%  did  not 

reduce  expenditure  on  education.  This  could  still  be  attributed  to  households  with  children  attending 

secondary school because primary education cost did not include school fees.  

 

This  is  in  line  with  the  Ministry  of  Education’s  policy  of  Free  Primary  Education  in  the  rural  areas.  The 

reduction of household expenditures on primary education costs consisted mostly of expenditure on PTA 

funds, school uniforms and requisite school materials such as books and pens.

3.5.  PROTECTION 
 
The  assessment  established  that  only  1%  of  the  households  in  the  assessed  areas  were  child  headed 

households,  and  that  there  were  more  male  child  headed  households  than  female  child  headed 

households.

The assessment also established 

that  about  27%  of  household 

heads  from  the  child  headed 

households  were  married  and 

that  over  70%  were  divorced 

indicating  incidences  of  early 

marriages in these communities.  

With  regards  to  orphans,  in 

general  very  few  families  were 

found  to  be  keeping  orphans. 

 

 

 

About  4%  of  the  households 

were  keeping  at 

least  one 

orphan 

(usually 

a 

close 

relative).  These  were  mostly 

from  household  heads  within 

the  age  groups  of  20  to  39

Incidences  of  violence  against  women  and  children  in  the  communities  and  camps  during  the  flooding 

period  were  not  very  common.  However  some  cases  were  reported  by  18%  of  the  respondents.  The 

most common cases in order of ranking were; early marriages (35%), assault (25%), sexual exploitation 

(14%),  rape  (11%),  child  defilement  (9%)  and  other types  of  violence  (1%). In  most  of  the  instances 

the  main  perpetrators  of  these  cases  were  relatives/neighbours  and  other  people  (94%),  while 

development workers constituted 4% of the perpetrators.  

 

There  were  few  cases  of  missing  persons  during  the  flooding  period  (7%).  The  assessment  also 

established that there were very few cases of children living together without adults (14%), and cases of 

individual adults taking care of children where also minimal (18%).

In  most  of  the  communities  assessed  there  are  HIV  prevention  activities  being  undertaken  by 

government agencies, the NGOs and community groups. Government interventions constitute the bulk of 

the preventive measures at 40%, while NGOs constitute 32% and community measures constitute 28%.  

 

The  assessment  established  that  generally  reporting  mechanism  for  rights  violations  do  exist  in  the 

communities.  The  reporting  mechanisms  include;  the  police  (43%),  the  local  authorities  (37%),  local 

clinics (15%) and humanitarian actors (15%). 

 

3.6.  HUMAN SETTLEMENT AND SHELTER 

 

The  findings  on  Human  Settlement  and  Shelter  established  that  8%  of  the  total  households  that  were 

affected  by  the  floods  were  displaced.  This  translates  into  a  total  of  82,662  households  (495,972 

people).  The  worst  affected  provinces  were;  southern  province  accounting  for  33%  of  the  displaced 

cases, followed by  western province at 28%, northern province at 10% and central province at 7%. In 

terms  of  location  segregation,  87%  of  the  displaced  cases  were  in  the  rural  areas  while  13%  were  in 

urban areas.   

 

For those in the rural areas, 41% depended on crop production as their main livelihood, 16% on casual 

labour,  9%  on  livestock  sales,  9%  on  petty  trading,  6%  on  fishing  and  the  remaining  18%  on  various 

activities such as gardening, beer brewing, small business and skilled labour.

3.7.2  Habitations (Houses) 

The impact on habitations was moderate as 52% of respondents reported that houses collapsed. At the 

time of the assessment the people whose houses had collapsed were rebuilding their houses. 

 

3.7.3  Health Facilities 

The floods caused moderate structural damage to health infrastructure but did not disrupt operations at 

most of the health centres in the areas assessed. Out of the sampled areas 22% reported damage to the 

health infrastructure. However accessibility to the health centres was difficult due to water logging (44% 

of the respondents in the assessed areas reported that there was no access to health facilities).  

 

 
The  damage  to  school  infrastructure  was  moderate  as  indicated  by  an  average  of  25%  of  the 

3.7.4  Schools 

respondents  from  the  community  interviews.  The  damage  was  mostly  on  school  toilets  and  classroom 

blocks.    Collapse  of  toilets  constituted  60%  of  the  reported  damages  while  collapse  of  school 

infrastructure  made  up  30%  of  the  damages.  The  other  damages  were  on  water  points  and  teacher’s 

houses.  The  floods  caused  the  collapse  of  50%  of  the  toilets  at  the  affected  schools  while  18%  of  the 

water points were flooded and contaminated with impurities. 

 

Basic  schools  were  the  most  affected  (82%)  compared  to  community  schools  (18%).  The  damage  to 

classroom buildings was low, (27% of the community respondents reported damage to classroom blocks 

while  73%  reported  no  damage).  In  the  case  of  damaged  classroom  buildings,  it  was  established  that 

the damage was mostly on single classrooms and double units (1x2 classrooms blocks) where roofs were 

blown and the buildings developed cracks and in certain cases collapsed.  

The  damage  to  the  classroom  buildings  at  Community  schools  was  mostly  due  to  the  poor  of  quality 

materials  that  were  used  to  construct  the  schools  and  thereby  by  making  them  susceptible  to  flood 

damage. 

 

Damage  to  the  teachers’  houses  was  also  low  (20%  of  the  respondents  reported  damage  to  teachers’ 

houses  while  80%  reported  that  there  was  no  damage  to  the  houses).  However  53%  of  the  teachers’ 

houses  were  generally  found  to  be  in  a  bad  state  due  to  lack  of  maintenance.  There  was  minimal 

damage to school furniture and sports facilities (sports halls and fields) as a result of the floods. 

 

3.7.5   Boreholes and Water Points 

The  assessment  established  that  there  was  no  physical  damage  to  the  boreholes  although  there  were 

indications  that  the  quality  of  water  was  poor.  The  other  water  points  such  as  hand-dug  wells  were 

flooded and collapsed.  

 

 
The  impact  on  markets  was  moderate.  This  is  because  the  damage  to  physical  structures  at  the 

3.7.6  Other Infrastructure 

markets  at  both  district  and  community  level  was  not  significant.  It  was  mostly  accessibility  to  the 

markets  that  was  difficult  due  to  water  logging.  However  informal  markets  through  exchange  of 

commodities (barter system) continued to constitute a major part of the communities’ market systems.

3.8.  OTHER GENEREAL FINDINGS 

 

3.8.1  Environment 

The floods had moderate effect on the environment (52%). This resulted in soil erosion and formation of 

gullies that will have long-term negative consequences on the state of the environment.  

 

Most of the assessed communities (79%) had waste disposal facilities. The most common facilities were 

refuse pits. However there was also a high practice of indiscriminate waste disposal. 

 

3.8.2  Early Warning Systems 

The assessment established that 73% of the respondents in the assessed areas were not warned about 

the floods, while out of the 27% of those who indicted that they were warned 63% did not heed to these 

warnings and hence did not take any preventive measures. The most common sources of early warning 

information  were;  radio  (79%),  followed  by  the  Meteorological  Department  (64.9%),  television  (18.2) 

and the DDMC (I6.7%). Other sources such as the Department of Water Affairs, ZESCO, newspapers and 

information education and campaign materials were not common. 

 
 
4.0 CONCLUSIONS  

 

4.1.  Food Security  

The impact of the floods and water logging on crops was particularly pronounced in six (6) provinces of 

Zambia  namely  Central,  Copperbelt,  Luapula,  Lusaka,  Southern  and  Western.  Of  the  thirty  seven  (39) 

districts  visited,  twenty-one  (21)  were  found  to  have  had  most  households  who  experienced  drastic 

reduction  in  their  harvest  of  the  main  staple  and  would  require  food  assistance.  A  total  of  444,624 

people  (74,104  Households)  were  deemed  to  be  food  insecure  in  the  21  districts  and  would  require 

33,333 Metric tons of cereal for a period of nine (9) months staring from July 2008 to March 2009. 

Livestock  prices  (mainly  cattle)  in  almost  all  assessed  districts  rose  in  December  2007.  The  fact  that 

prices in most districts rose suggests that there was no desperation for households to sell off their cattle 

at low as they were able to negotiate for higher prices. The highest cattle price increases were recorded 

in  Sinazongwe,  Mumbwa,  Mazabuka,  Namwala  and  Sesheke.  This  shows  that  at  the  time  of  the 

assessment, the impact of the livestock ban movement due to the Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak had 

not yet started reducing income for farmers.     

 

In the assessed districts maize prices were high, especially in the low producing districts of Sinazongwe, 

Shangombo,  Kalabo,  Lukulu,  Zambezi,  Mambwe  and  Mongu  where  the  prices  were  above  K1,200/Kg. 

Sinazongwe  particularly  reported  abnormally  high  prices  even  being  a  low  producing  district  of 

K1,900/Kg,  an  indication  of  a  possible  shortage.  Among  the  high  producing  districts,  only  Mumbwa 

reported high maize prices of K1,280/Kg, an indication of significant supply reduction.

4.2.   Health and Nutrition 

The  prevalence  of  Severe  Acute  Malnutrition  (SAM)  was  found  to  be  2.3%  out  of  which  0.6%  had 

bilateral  oedema.  Global  Acute  Malnutrition  (GAM)  was  7.7%  indicating  an  increase  of  2.1%  from  the 

June 2007 in-depth findings. 

 

The  assessment  established  that  immunization  coverage  was  high  in  all  the  assessed  districts.  The 

measles  coverage  of  96.2  %  was  recorded  among  children  aged  between  9-59  months,  98.7%  was 

recorded  for  OPV  and  DPT  immunization  while  the  BCG  coverage  was  found  to  be  at  97.6%.  A  small 

percentage (0.3%) of the eligible children did not receive vaccines while 3.5% of the child caretakers did 

not  know  whether  the  child  had  been  immunized  or  not.  There  was  no  severe  impact  of  floods  on 

physical  health  infrastructure  in  all  the  assessed  districts.  However,  Mkushi,  Mumbwa,  Lufwanyama, 

Masaiti, Mpongwe, Ndola and Mpulungu reported minor damages on some health facilities. 

 

4.3. 

 Water and Sanitation 

From  the  findings  it  is  clear  that  the  floods  in  the  2007/2008  season  increased  water  contamination  in 

unprotected water sources like rivers or lakes, unprotected shallow wells and unprotected springs which 

accounted  for  37.9%  of  the  households.  This  is  evidenced  in  the  occurrence  of  diarrhoea  diseases 

amongst  households  that  draw  water  from  the  unprotected  sources  which  is  30.5%  for  rivers  or  lakes 

being  the  highest.  The  impact  on  water  quality  was  severe  during  the  rainy  season  in  areas  that 

experienced floods and heavy rainfall. 

 

4.4.  Education 

The  assessment  established  that  76%  (44%  males  and  32%  females)  of  the  children  dropped  out  of 

school because the family could not afford to meet their school requirements, 15% (8% males) dropped 

out because of lack of interest in school and 7% (all females) drop out of school due to pregnancies. The 

other  reasons  for  dropping  out  of  school  such  as:  work  for  food/cash;  care  for  sick  family  member; 

hunger; and collapsed school were insignificant at 2%. 

 

4.5.  Protection 

Incidences  of  violence  against  women  and  children  in  the  communities  and  camps  during  the  flooding 

period  were  not  very  common.  However  some  cases  were  reported  by  18%  of  the  respondents.  The 

most common cases in order of ranking were; early marriages (35%), assault (25%), sexual exploitation 

(14%),  rape  (11%),  child  defilement  (9%)  and  other types  of  violence  (1%). In  most  of  the  instances 

the  main  perpetrators  of  these  cases  were  relatives/neighbours  and  other  people  (94%),  while 

development workers constituted 4% of the perpetrators.  

 

4.6.  Human Settlement and Shelter 

The floods displaced 8% of the total households that were affected by the floods. This translates into a 

total  of  82,662  households  (495,972  people).  The  worst  affected  provinces  were;  Southern  Province 

accounting for 33% of the displaced cases, followed by Western Province at 28%, Northern Province at 

Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee – 2008                                            

48 

 
10% and Central Province at 7%. In terms of location segregation, 87% of the displaced cases were in 

the rural areas while 13% were in urban areas.   

 

4.7. 

Infrastructure 

The damages caused by the floods on infrastructure were mostly on roads, bridges and culverts – 66% 

of the roads, bridges and culverts in the assessed areas were damaged. The floods also caused damage 

to school infrastructure on classroom blocks and sanitation facilities. Both basic schools and community 

schools were affected. The community schools made from pole and mud suffered structural damage due 

to the poor quality of materials used to construct them. The basic schools with permanent structures had 

their roofs blown off and their toilets collapsing. 

 

4.8.  General Findings 

The floods had adverse effects on the environment and caused soil erosion and the formation of gullies 

that could lead to further deterioration of the environment.  

 

The  assessment  also  established  that  early  warning  systems  were  effected  through  various  modes  of 

communication including; electronic media, print media and the use of local authorities and government 

agencies. However, only a few people received the warning but did not take any preventive measures.
