Introduction 

The  beginning of the 2008/9 rainy season  was described  by the Zambia Meteorological 

Department  (ZMD)  as  normal  with  the  rains  having  started  early  in  most  parts  of  the 

country apart from the extreme eastern parts of the country (Lundazi, Chama and Isoka). 

However,  as  the  season  progressed  there  was  widespread  increased  rainfall  intensity  in 

December and January while rains in the southern half the country eased off in February 

resulting  in  prolonged  dry  spell  in  the  extreme  south.  The  month  of  March  was 

characterised by wide spread heavy rains culminating into flash floods especially in low 

lying areas of the country (i.e. valleys). This had varied degree of negative impact on key 

sectors of the economy. 

 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  Zambia  Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee  (ZVAC) 

undertook a Multi-Sectoral In-Depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment in twenty (20) 

districts  in order to determine the  impact of the 2008/9  floods on various  sectors of the 

economy.  The  districts  visited  were  Kapiri  Mposhi,  Serenje,  Mambwe,  Kawambwa, 

Mpika,  Mungwi,  Mporokoso,  Chavuma,  Zambezi,  Kabompo,  Kasempa,  Mufumbwe, 

Mwinilunga, Lukulu, Kaoma, Mongu, Kalabo, Shang’ombo, Senanga and Sesheke. 

The assessment employed the qualitative and quantitative approaches in the collection of 

the  data.  Under  the  quantitative  approach,  structured  household  questionnaires  were 

employed  in  280  Standard  Enumeration  Areas  (SEAs)  targeting  a  total  of  2,  800 

households  in  twenty  (20)  districts.  Under  the  qualitative  approach,  community 

interviews  were  conducted  in  all  the  280  SEAs.  In  each  of  the  sampled  SEA, 

anthropometric data collection methods were used to collect nutrition data for the under-

five children.

Major Findings 

•  The post floods survey conducted  in twenty (20) districts established that a total 

of  499,  359  people  (83,  227  households)  were  negatively  impacted  upon  by  the 

2008/9  flood  situation.  It  should  be  emphasized  that  this  figure  represents  the 

number  of  people  and  households  affected  overally  and  does  not  in  any  way 

represent any sector based population.   

•  The major income sources for most of the households were cash crop production, 

casual labour, petty trading and fishing, in order of importance. It was found that 

there  were  no  major  differences  in  income  sources  of  the  sampled  households 

between the 2007/08 and the 2008/09 season. This  implies that no  major  impact 

was exerted on these sources by floods. 

•  The  production  of  cereals,  mainly  maize,  had  risen  in  all  the  assessed  districts. 

Increase in production of the staple from the previous season ranged between 4% 

for Mwinilunga and Kabompo to 39% for Lukulu. 

•  Although maize prices have started falling as small scale maize becomes available 

on the market from the new harvest, maize grain prices have remained generally 

high.  Breakfast meal prices were still rising in the month of May while the price 

of roller meal marginally dropped. 

•  The prevalence of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) was found to be 1.4% out of 

which  0.3%  had  bilateral  oedema.  Global  Acute  Malnutrition  (GAM  stood  at 

3.6%. These results show no significant differences from the expected situation in 

the country. 

•  Based on the above scenario, it was established that a total of 110, 651 people (18, 

442 households) in seven (7) districts were found to be food insecure. 

•  The  survey  found  that  69.2%  of  the  under  five  children  had  suffered  from 

Fever/suspected malaria, diarrhoea (watery stool), Cough, or skin infection while 

30.8% did not suffer from any illness. 

•  The  assessment  established  that  immunization  coverage  was  high  in  all  the 

assessed districts. The measles coverage of 86.5 % was recorded among children 

aged  between  6-59  months,  93.7%  was  recorded  for  OPV  and  94.1%  for  DPT

immunization  while  the  BCG  coverage  was  found  to  be  at  97.2%.  The  health 

Card (76.9%) and verbal history provided by the caregiver (22.2%) were the main 

source of information for child immunization. 

•  For water and sanitation, the assessment established that 50% of the communities 

drew  water  from  unprotected  water  sources  such  as  lakes,  rivers,  unprotected 

wells and unprotected springs. 

•  Of the sampled households, 24% indicated that they treated their drinking water. 

The  most  commonly  used  method  for  water  treatment  was  found  to  be  use  of 

chlorine (19%) and boiling (5%). There were very  few  households who resorted 

to filtration as a water treatment method.  

•  The assessment revealed that 45% of the sampled households indicated that water 

sources were within 100 to 500 meters while 32% of the households indicated that 

water sources were located at a distance less than 100 meters. 

•  The  assessment  revealed  that  the  main  sanitary  facilities  used  by  the  sampled 

households were traditional latrine (67.8%). 

• 

In the last 6 months, 97% of respondents indicated that they did not have any boys 

and girls that dropped out of school. 

•  The highest form of violence was early marriage (3.9%) and this was followed by 

other  types  ranked  as  follows:  assault  (3.4%),  child  defilement  (1.0%),  rape 

(0.9%)  and  other  types  of  violence  (0.9%)  and  sexual  exploitation  (0.2%).  The 

highest proportion (5.7%) of child defilements occurred in households headed by 

the 16 to 19 years age group and the next highest proportion was in the age range 

of 40 to 59 years (0.9%). 

•  The survey revealed that of the total number of households that were affected by 

floods,  only  10%  were  displaced.  This  translates  into  a  total  of  280  households 

displaced (1,680 people).  The displacement of the households was mainly due to 

the weak housing structures which are built with pole, mud and grass. 

•  The  infrastructure  sector  was  the  worst  hit  sector  by  the  2008/9  floods.  Roads, 

bridges and culverts were washed away by the flood waters. School infrastructure 

also suffered major damage.

Conclusions  

 

Infrastructure 

A total of 327 structures were damaged or washed away. This includes roads, bridges 

and  culverts  in  different  districts  of  the  country.  The  school  infrastructure  has  been 

covered under education. 

 

Agriculture and Food Security 

The production of the staple in all the twenty districts had increased with the increase 

ranging from 4% to 39%. However, owing to the fact that most of these districts have 

had floods the past three seasons, it is likely that this marginal increase would afford 

the community enough resilience in terms of food security. 

 

Cattle  prices  in  the  assessed  districts  either  rose  or  remained  stable  with  respect  to 

prices  which  prevailed  in  December  2008.  The  fact  that  cattle  prices  in  areas  with 

relatively  low  December  prices  (lean  season  prices)  increased  in  May  shows  that  at 

the time of the assessment, farmers were still able to negotiate for higher prices and 

therefore not desperate to sale.  

The  price  increases  over  the  previous  season  were  high  for  most  areas  with  the 

highest  reported  in  Kaoma  (100%),  while  Lukulu,  Senanga,  Kalabo,  Mwinilunga, 

Shang’ombo  and  Mongu  reported  at  least  50%  increase  in  price.  This  can  be 

attributed  to  the  fact  that  2008/09  marketing  season  was  a  maize  deficit  year  when 

most areas experienced low maize supply towards the end of the season which pushed 

prices  up  significantly.  Therefore  May  2009  prices  still  remained  high  as  the  new 

harvest had not yet adequately reached the market. 

Of  the  twenty  (20)  districts  visited,  7  districts  were  found  to  have  most  households 

which had experienced drastic reduction in their harvest of the main staple. A total of 

110, 651 people (18,442 households) were found to be food insecure and will require 

some  assistance.  Four  districts  namely  Kapiri  Mposhi,  Kasempa,  Mambwe  and 

 

4 

                                                                                                                                          

 

 

 

 

 

Mongu were likely to face food insecurity as the analysis showed that the situation in 

the districts could go either way. 

Nutrition 

The 2009 in-depth vulnerability assessment revealed that vitamin A supplementation 

and de-worming program among children (6 – 59 months) was as low as 61.6% and 

17.2 %. These coverage results, on vitamin A supplementation and de-worming, are 

lower compared to other community surveys that have been conducted before. 

It  was  also  observed  that  the  supplementation  and  therapeutic  feeding  programs 

coverages were  low (2.0 and 1.4% respectively).  The  number of children who were 

reported  to  have  been  on  therapeutic  feeing  program  at  the  point  of  survey  was  14 

(1.0%). 

The  in-depth  assessment  revealed  that  the  prevalence  of  Severe  Acute  Malnutrition 

(SAM) was 1.4%. The proportion of children with bilateral oedema was 0.3%. Global 

Acute  Malnutrition  (GAM)  was  3.6%.  Underweight  rate  among  under-five  children 

was 15.2%, of which about 5% were severe. Stunting was the most prevalent form of 

malnutrition  in  the  flood  affected  areas.  The  levels  of  malnutrition  (wasting)  in  the 

flood  affected  areas  were  normal,  while  the  levels  of  underweight  were  slightly 

higher.      

Water and Sanitation 

The  assessment  revealed  that  most of  the  unprotected  water  sources  such  as  spring, 

well and rivers were highly prone to contamination of faecal matter due to flooding. 

About  36%  of  the  sampled  households  whose  main  water  source  was  unprotected 

wells indicated having a household member suffering from diarrhoea. The assessment 

further revealed that 22% of the households whose main water source was river/lake 

and 19% of the households whose main water source was borehole indicated having a 

household  member  suffering  from  diarrhoea.    Despite  the  unsafe  water  sources  that 

the sampled households used, 74% of them indicated that the water quality was good.

Health 

The  survey  found  that  69.2%  of  the  under  five  children  had  suffered  from 

fever/suspected  malaria,  diarrhoea  (watery  stool),  cough,  or  skin  infection  while 

30.8% did not suffer from any illness. The assessment established that immunization 

coverage was high in all the assessed districts. The measles coverage of 86.5 % was 

recorded  among  children  aged  between  6-59  months,  93.7%  was  recorded  for  OPV 

and 94.1% for DPT immunization while the BCG coverage was found to be at 97.2%. 

A small percentage of the eligible children did not receive vaccines while 0.9% of the 

child  caretakers  did  not  know  whether  the  child  had  been  immunized  or  not. 

Shang’ombo was the only district that reported severe damage on the health  facility 

while  Kabompo,  Kasempa  and  Lukulu  had  their  facilities  moderately  affected. 

Kawambwa,  Mufumbwe,  Mwinilunga,  Zambezi,  Mongu,  Senanga  and  Sesheke 

reported  minor  damages  on  the  health  facilities.  However,  there  was  no  impact  of 

floods  on  health  infrastructure  in  Kapiri  Mposhi,  Serenje,  Mambwe,  Mporokoso, 

Mungwi, Chavuma and Kalabo districts.   

Education 

The  assessment  indicated  that the  floods  did  not have  remarkable  impact on  school 

drop out. It was established that the reasons why 2.6% of children dropped out were 

due  to  the  fact  that  the  family  could  not  afford  school  fees.  The  other  reasons  for 

school drop – out were because of pregnancy on the part of girls and ill health. The 

assessment also established that schools in the assessed districts had suffered damage 

due to the heavy rainfall. 

Social Protection 

The  assessment  showed  that  there  were  social  protection  issues  in  the  assessed 

districts  although  the  cases  were  very  low.  The  most  common  cases  in  order  of 

ranking were; early marriages (35%), assault (25%), sexual exploitation (14%), rape 

(11%),  child  defilement  (9%)  and  other  types  of  violence  (1%).  In  most  of  the 

instances  the  main  perpetrators  of  these  cases  were  relatives/neighbours  and  other 

people (94%), while development workers constituted 4% of the perpetrators.

Human Habitation and Shelter 

The  floods  displaced  10%  of  the  total  households  (2,797  households)  that  were 

affected by the floods. This translates into a total of 280 households (1, 680 people) 

with  the  Western  Province  being  the  worst  affected.  All  the  displaced  communities 

were actually in the rural areas.
