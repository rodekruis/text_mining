EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 
Following  recommendations  from  the  2009  rapid  assessment,  the  Zambia 

Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee  (ZVAC)  undertook  the  In-Depth  Vulnerability 

and  Needs  Assessment  in  twenty  (20)  districts.  The  assessment  report  made 

recommendations necessary to mitigate the effects of floods and /or water logging 

in the affected districts.  

 

In  order  to  ensure  speedy  implementation  of  these  recommendations,  it  became 

necessary  to  translate  the  recommendations  into  a  Recovery  Action  Plan  with 

specific activities and costing.  

 

The  document  starts  with  an  introduction  that  discusses  the  structure  and 

management of the Recovery Action Plan. The required sector specific interventions 

and  costing  are  then  discussed  focusing  on  Education,  Health,  Nutrition, 

Infrastructure,  Human  Settlement  and  Shelter,  Water  and  Sanitation,  Agriculture 

and Food Security. 

 

It  is  important  to  note  that  recommended  interventions  reflect  sectoral  needs  in 

short,  medium  and  long-term  perspectives.  The  financial  requirements  per  sector 

are also discussed.

The  Implementation  of  the  action  plan  is  to  be  done  with  full  participation  of  all 

stakeholders  such  as  relevant  Government  agencies,  donors,  UN  System,  private 

sector  and  NGOs.  The  NGOs  in  conjunction  with  the  district  and  satellite  disaster 

management  committees  will  be  the  front  line  implementers  at  the  district  level. 

The  timeframe  for  the  implementation  of  interventions  is  projected  to  be  twelve 

(12) months beginning in July 2009. 

The Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Unit (DMMU)  will  spearhead  coordination 

and  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  action  plan  with  the  support  of  the 

 

vi 

 

core  coordination  team,  drawing  membership  from  Government,  UN,  and  NGO 

agencies. 

Monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  Recovery  Action  Plan  will  be  based  on  sector 

specific performance indicators that form part of this action plan document.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

The  beginning  of  the  2008/9  rainy  season  was  described  by  the  Zambia 

Meteorological  Department (ZMD)  as normal  with  the  rains having  started early in 

most  parts  of  the  country  apart  from  the  extreme  eastern  parts  of  the  country 

(Lundazi,  Chama  and  Isoka).  However,  as  the  season  progressed  it  was 

characterised  by  wide  spread  heavy  rains  resulting  in  floods  in  some  parts  of  the 

country. The floods, which were characterised by wide spread flash flooding mostly 

in low lying areas of the country (i.e. valleys), negatively impacted the key sectors 

of the economy. The degree of the impact varied from sector to sector. 

 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  Zambia  Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee  (ZVAC) 

undertook  a  Multi-sectoral  In-depth  Assessment  in  twenty  (20)  districts.  The 

assessment  was  aimed  at  determining the  extent  and  effects  of  the  2008/9  floods 

and/or water logging on various sectors of the economy. The provinces and districts 

where  the  assessments  were  conducted  included  Central  Province  (Kapiri-Mposhi 

and  Serenje),  Eastern  Province  (Mambwe),  Luapula  Province  (Kawambwa), 

Northern  Province  (Mpika,  Mungwi  and  Mporokoso),  North-Western  Province 

(Chavuma,  Kabompo,  Kasempa,  Mufumbwe,  Mwinilunga,  Zambezi)  Western 

Province( Kalabo, Kaoma, Lukulu, Mongu, Senanga, Shangombo, Sesheke)  

To  ensure  a  speedy  and  coordinated  response,  the Government  of  the Republic  of 

Zambia  has  provided  a  general  framework  within  which  all  stakeholders  will 

undertake  all  interventions  related  to  floods.    The  plan  defines  the  scale  of  the 

problem  and  the  rationale 

for  the 

implementation  of  the  recommended 

interventions. It brings out the general response strategy and outlines sector based 

interventions  in  short  and  medium  to  long-term  perspectives.  Implementation, 

reporting, monitoring and coordination arrangements are also spelt out. 

 

 

1 

 

2.0. SCALE OF THE PROBLEM 
 
The  country  has  experienced  floods  for  three  consecutive  seasons  which  have 

resulted in  damage to  Infrastructure  mainly  roads,  culverts  and  bridges  as  well  as 

Crops.  These  floods  and/or  water  logging  have  generally  exposed  the  affected 

Population  to  the  risk  of  outbreak  of  waterborne  diseases  and  increased  the 

likelihood  of  animal  disease  incidences  to  rise.  The  damage  to  crops  created  food 

insecurity problems in the districts affected in the five (5) provinces although there 

was a marginal increase in crop production. In order to mitigate the impact of the 

floods,  Government  will  need  to  implement  short  to  medium  and  long-term 

interventions in all the eight (8) sectors identified to have been affected.  

 

3.0. RATIONALE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDED 

      INTERVENTIONS 

 

The  2008/09  rainfall  season  was  characterised  with  wide  spread  heavy  rains  in 

most parts of the country with wide spread flash flooding mostly in low lying areas 

of  the  country  (i.e.  valleys)  that  resulted  into  adverse  impacts  on  different  key 

economic  sectors  such  Agriculture  and  Food  Security,  Education,  Health  and 

Nutrition,  Infrastructure,  human  Habitations  Water  and  Sanitation  in  five  (5) 

provinces of the country.   

  

The Government should as a matter of urgency address the negative impact of the 

floods  by  implementing  sector  specific  interventions  which  range  from  short  term 

needs  to  those  that  seek  to  address  medium  to  long  term  needs.  The 

implementation  of  the  recommended  interventions  will  help  open  up  places  that 

were  cut  off  due  to  damage  to  infrastructure,  thus  effectively  restoring  the 

movement  of  people.  The  interventions  will  further  help  mitigate  other  negative 

effects  in  the  identified  sectors  such  as  prevention  of  water  borne  diseases, 

maintain  economic  viability  and  reduce  if  not  prevent  increase  in  the  levels  of 

malnutrition among affected communities through provision of relief.  

 

2 

 

 

 

4.0 GENERAL RESPONSE STRATEGY 

 

The governmentâ€™s strategy is to mobilize all available human, financial and material 

resources and redirect these to areas that were affected. This strategy also entails 

cooperate  approach  by  involving  all  relevant  Government,  Donor  community,  UN 

System, Private sector and NGOs agencies (both local and international). 

 

5.0 REQUIRED INTERVENTIONS 

 

As reflected in the floods In-Depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment report, the 

required interventions involve eight (8) sectors with activities ranging from those of 

short  to  medium  and  long  term.  The  main  sectors  involved  are  those  that  the 

assessment established  as  having  been  severely  affected  by  the  floods.  These  are 

Health  and  Nutrition,  Water  and  Sanitation,  Infrastructure,  Human  settlement and 

Shelter, Education, Agriculture and Food Security. 

 

These  interventions  are  based  on  the  fact  that  there  is  some  level  of  response 

going  on  in  each  of  these  sectors.  This  level  of  response  however,  falls  short  of 

meeting  the  demands/needs  in  the  floods  affected  districts.    What  is  required 

therefore is the scaling up of the interventions so as to make them more effective 

and  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  floods  affected  districts.  The  required 

interventions are as summarised in the sector by activity in table 2 below:

6.0    IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 

In order to ensure maximum participation of all stakeholders and at the same time 

ensure  that  Portfolio  institutions  and  agencies  take  up  their  responsibilities  as  we 

scale-up  the  operation,  the  affected  sectors  in  conjunction  with  relevant  UN,  NGO 

and  Private  sector  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  their 

activities  based  on  the  sector  needs  as  per  attached  sector  specific  annexes. 

Satellite  Disaster  Management  Committees  in  conjunction  with  NGOs  will  be  front 

line  implementers  while  District  Disaster  Management  Committees  will  be  the 

overall district supervisors. 

 
 
6.1  Current level of response 
 
As mentioned earlier, it is important to recognize that a lot has already been 

done  by  Government in  collaboration  with its  co-operating  partners in  terms 

of response interventions.   

The  implementation  of  this  action  plan  should  therefore  be  seen  within  the 

context  of  scaling  up  of  the  existing  interventions  based  on  the  2009  Rapid 

Assessment and not necessarily kick-starting of the recovery operation. 

 

6.2  Scaling Up 

 In  order  to  scale  up  the  level  of  current  response  and  make  the  operation 

more  effective  and  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  affected  populations, it is 

important 

that 

the  sector-based 

interventions  are 

implemented  as 

recommended (see Annexes 1 to 8 for more details). 

 

7.0    ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
The  major  stakeholders  such  as  the  Ministries  of  Education,  Health,  Agriculture, 

Works  and  Supply,  Department  of  Water  Affairs,  Local  Government  and  Housing, 

Community  Development,  Finance  and  Donor  community,  the  UN  system,  Private 

sector  including  NGOs  both  local  and  international  will  play  an  important  role  to 

 

 

ensure  that  the  planned  programmes  are  timely  and  efficiently  implemented  in 

order  for  the  programme  to  be  effective  and  responsive  enough  to  achieve  the 

programme objectives. Each Ministry/Department will nominate a dedicated officer 

who  will  be  part  of  the  coordination  core  team  to  overseer  the  implementation  of 

the  recommended  interventions.    Satellite  Disaster  Management  Committees  in 

conjunction with NGOs will be the front line implementers of the interventions while 

District  Disaster  Management  Committees  (DDMC)  will  have  the  district  overall 

supervisory responsibilities.  

  

8.0    TIME FRAME 

The activities will be implemented within twelve (12) months beginning in July 2009. 

This period will cover the implementation of short to medium and some long-term 

interventions. 

 

9.0    REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS 

All implementing agencies will generate progress reports and submit them to DMMU 

through the National Coordinator on monthly basis.  DMMU will in turn consolidate 

the  sector  reports  in  one  document  and  submit  it  to  Government  and  other 

stakeholders for decision-making and information sharing. 

 

10.0   COORDINATION 

 

The coordination of the implementation of the rehabilitation plan (short to medium 

and long  term)  will be  spearheaded  by DMMU  supported  by  the  Coordination  Core 

Team  with  representation  from  Government,  Donors,  UN  system,  private  sector 

and NGOs.  

 

 

7 

 

11.0   MONITORING AND EVALUATION 

 

Monitoring of the implementation of interventions will be based on the indicators as 

brought  out  in  the  monitoring  and  valuation  indicators  table  (Refer  to  Table  3) 

and will be done at different levels namely: through reports, field trips involving a 

combined  team  of  main  stakeholders  or  individual  institutions  and  organizations. 

Political leadership at national, provincial and local levels will be critical in ensuring 

that the objectives of this recovery action plan are achieved in line with its rationale. 

  

Effectiveness  of  the  interventions  will  be  evaluated  in  terms  of  outcomes  and 

impact  on  the  target  population  and  districts.  A  final  impact  assessment  will  be 

conducted.  The  report  will  be  presented  to  Government  and  shared  with  other 

stakeholders for important reflections on the response and recovery programme.

ANNEXES 

Annex 1: EDUCATION 
 

Problem statement and rationale 

The  Education  Sector  was  not  spared  from  the  effects  of  the  floods  that 

occurred  during  the  2008/09  rainfall  season.  Arising  from  that,  learning  was 

disrupted  as  School  Infrastructure  got  submerged  and  damaged  resulting  in 

some schools being closed and others were operating at half capacity.  

 

 

The Ministry of Education has assessed the impact of the floods and prioritized 

interventions  as  medium  and  long  term  to  rehabilitate  the  damaged 

infrastructure and preposition school kits. 

 

Activities 

The activities to be implemented in the medium term and long term are mainly  

rehabilitation  works  on  all  school 

infrastructure  damaged  by 

floods,  

construction  of  school  infrastructure  (Classrooms,  Teachersâ€™  houses,  VIP 

latrines)  at 76 identified Schools,  Procurement and Prepositioning of  school in 

a box and recreational kits.  

 

Targets 

Carry out rehabilitation works at 76 schools in 20 districts in 6 provinces.  

 

Implementing Agency 

Ministry of Education will be the lead-implementing Agency and will be assisted 

by Cooperating Partners. 

 
Immediate Financial Requirements: ZMK 672,000,000.00 (US$134,400.00)

Annex 2: HEALTH 
 

PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Reference  is  made  to  the  2009  heavy  rains  that  caused  numerous  health 

problems  in  the  assessed  20  districts  in  the  country.  The  health  sector 

experienced challenges as follows; 

â€¢  Disruption  of  health  services  such  as  inaccessible  health  facilities  and  the 

resulting surge in demand at other service delivery points is likely to result 

in shortages of essential drugs /supplies and overburdened health staff. 

â€¢  Pooling of water leading to an increase in the mosquito breeding sites and a 

possible  increase  in  the  cases  of  malaria  especially  after  the  flood  water 

recedes. 

â€¢  Cross-contamination of drinking water sources and faecal disposal facilities 

coupled  with  the  difficulties  faced  to  access  alternative  safe  water  sources 

may  result  in  epidemics  of  diarrhoeal  diseases  such  as  cholera  and 

dysentery. 

â€¢  Overcrowding  of  displaced  people  in  their  places  of  resettlement  may  lead 

to  respiratory  tract  infection  and  outbreaks  of  immunizable  diseases 

especially measles. 

â€¢  The displaced people especially children and pregnant women  are likely to 

miss  their  immunization  schedules  and  their  antenatal  services  leaving 

them vulnerable to contracting preventable diseases. 

 

ACTIVITIES 

â€¢  Disease prevention and treatment. 

â€¢  Health education. 

â€¢  Monitoring and evaluation.

Annex 3: NUTRITION 
 
Problem Statement 

Floods  are likely  to  cause  numerous  health  and  nutritional  problems in the 

country.  An  anticipated  increase  in  levels  of  food  and  nutrition  insecurity 

and  diseases  related  to  overcrowding  is  inevitable.  The  broad  nutrition 

sector challenges include the following: 

 

â€¢  Disruption  of  preventive  health  and  nutrition  services  such  as 

inaccessible  health  facilities  and  inadequate  Growth  Monitoring  and 

promotion  service  points  and the  resulting  surge in  demand  at  other 

service  delivery  points  is  likely  to  result  in  shortages  of  essential 

medicines and nutrition supplies and over-stretched health staff.  

  

â€¢  Resultant  household  food  and  nutrition  insecurity  will  lead  to 

malnutrition  and 

increased 

susceptibility 

to 

infectious  and 

immunizable diseases such as measles. 

  

           Activities 

The mitigation measures for Nutrition fall under the broad categories as 

shown in table1 below.

Target 
 
This plan targets the districts moderately or severely affected by floods. The classification is based on reports 

sent to DMMU, field reports, key informant interviews and the in-depth vulnerability assessment.  

 

Implementing Agency 

 

The  National  Food  and  Nutrition  Commission,  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  its  various  Cooperating  partners 

operating in the field of nutrition sectors will implement this plan. 

 
 

 

 

Annex 4: HUMAN SETTLEMENT AND SHELTER  

 

Problem Statement 

 

During  the 2008/09  rainfall  season,  a number  of  districts experienced 

floods which led to the displacement of a number of households.  

 

The vulnerability of the affected households was enhanced by the fact 

that households were located in the flood prone areas coupled with the 

weak  housing  structures  due  to  weak  building  materials  used  which 

are mainly pole, mud and grass.  

 

Although the impact of floods on human settlements was low in terms 

of  the  number  of  households  affected,  there  is  need  to  reduce  such 

vulnerability  and  the  impact  of  floods  by  realigning  the  settlement 

pattern  of  low  lying  areas  prone  to  flooding  by  relocating  them  to 

higher and safer lands. 

 

Furthermore, there is need to sensitize the vulnerable communities on 

the  dangers  of  settling  in  flood  water  channels  and  the  benefits  of 

building  better  structures  on  higher  and  safer  lands  as  a  permanent 

solution. 

 

Activities 

1.  consultations  with  local  leadership  (traditional  and  district 

administration) on identification of safer lands 

2.  acquisition  of  such  safe  lands  to  resettle  the  communities 

vulnerable to flooding 

 

30 

 

3.  conduct  a  survey  among  the  concerned  communities  to 

determine  their  willingness  to  relocate  to  higher  lands  and 

educate them on possible livelihood sources 

4.  site preparation of the new settlement 

a.  boundary delineation 

b.  plot demarcation 

c.  road clearing 

d.  borehole drilling 

e.  plot allocation 

f.  resettling of the new settlers 

The  action  plan  will  be  implemented  in  two  phases.  The  affected 

districts by order of severity are as follows: - 

 

Phase I 

In phase 1, districts along the Zambezi River catchments are targeted. 

These are  

i.  Shangomboâ€™ 

ii.  Senanga 

iii. Kalabo 

 

Phase II 

In this phase, the following districts are targeted; 

i.  Mambwe 

ii.  Kaoma 

iii.  Lukulu 

 

 

31 

 

Implementation Agency 

a.  The  Department  of  Resettlement 

in  conjunction  with 

the 

Department  of  Physical  Planning  and  Housing,  UN-HABITAT,  IOM, 

District Councils, Red Cross etc. 

b.  DMMU will coordinate the implementation 

 

Financial  Requirements:  An  estimated  budget  total  of  ZMKK662, 

920,000(US$136,584.00)  will  be  required  to  undertake  the  above 

alluded to activities in both phases one and two.

Annex: 5. INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
Problem Situation:  
Road infrastructure, such as embankments, bridges and culverts, were 
damaged in some parts of the country due to heavy rains. The hardest 
hit  areas  are  the  Eastern,  Northern,  Western,  Lusaka  and  Copperbelt 
provinces  of  the  country.  This  has  impacted  negatively  on  the  social 
service delivery and economic development. 
 
Rationale 

 

To  develop  road  infrastructure  sector  specific  inputs  to  the  national 
response  strategy  document.  Therefore,  there  is  need  to  carryout 
urgent  reinstatements  to  the  affected  road  infrastructure  in  order  to 
restore accessibility to areas affected and ensure that: 
 

â€¢  Access to health centers, schools, market places and agricultural 

areas is   restored; 

â€¢  The  much-needed  relief  supplies  are  delivered  to  the  affected 

communities.  

 
Activities  
 
The proposed intervention measures are outlined below: 

â€¢  Repair and installation of washed away culverts; 
â€¢  Reinstatement  of  washed/eroded  embankments  and  stone  pitching 

the embankments; 

â€¢  Replacement of rotten timber bridges; 
â€¢  Reinforcing the existing bridge decks; 
â€¢  Reinstatement of washed away bridges with permanent structures; 
â€¢  Provision  of  vented drifts to allow for overtopping; and  
â€¢  Heavy  dredging  works  using  specialized  machinery for  the  clearing 

and construction of channels. 

 
Target  
 
The target is to reinstate the following 327 road and drainage 
structures in the 66 districts which experienced severe floods:  

â€¢  Thirty two (32) Bridges;  
â€¢  Two hundred and  Seventy Three  (273) Culverts; 
â€¢  Seventeen (17) Embankment structures; and 
â€¢  Five (05) road sections that have experienced severe erosion.

The Annual Work Plan 2009 for the RDA allowed for an amount  of  5 Billion  Kwacha  for emergencies which has since been used  
and exhausted for other major emergencies on the Lusitu Bridge  in Lusaka province and reinstatement of culverts on the Chipata 
Lundazi road in Eastern province

The projects were listed  in order of priority from all the  districts. The first three were taken as priority 1,2, 
and 3, if  the district had more than three projects the process was repeated for the remaining ones until all 
projects were classified.

Annex 6: SOCIAL PROTECTION 
 

Problem statement and rationale 

There  assessment  established  that  some  children  and  women  experienced  some 

form of violence during the floods in the districts visited. Some communities had 

no  prevention  measures  to  violence  while  others  did  not  have  reporting 

mechanisms in place. 

  

Children and women protection should ideally seek to prevent and put an end to 

violence,  exploitation  and  abuse  against  children,  women  and  other  vulnerable 

groups during an emergency. This should be done by strengthening the ability of 

individuals and families to protect themselves from future threats thereby laying 

the foundation for lasting security and stability. Individuals and families will only 

be  able  protect  themselves  if  all  stakeholders  and  child  protection  workers 

endeavor  to  create  a  protective  environment  which  will  warrant  protection  in 

emergency situations.  

 

Activities 

The mitigation measures for the Protection sector will include the following: 

 

 

â€¢  Initiate and promote family and community level safety (prevention) 

â€¢  Capacity building and awareness raising on childrenâ€™s and womenâ€™s rights 

â€¢  Psychosocial counseling 

All  activities  will  be  centered  on  creating  a  protective  environment  for  children 

and their families.

Annex 7: WATER AND SANITATION 
 
 
Problem Statement and Rationale 
 

During  the  2008/9  floods,  most  of  the  water  points  (especially  unprotected 

shallow wells) were submerged and some of the walls collapsed. Despite most of 

the  water  points  being  submerged,  people  have  continued  to  use  the  same 

sources  because  they lack  alternative  sources.  Therefore it is  necessary  that  the 

damaged  water  facilities  are  urgently  rehabilitated.  Furthermore,  the  affected 

communities  should  be  sensitized  on  water  treatment  and  proper  hygiene 

practices and also provided with chlorine.  

 

Activities 

The  sector  will  address  household  level  and  community  water  safety  and 

awareness  raising  on  improved  sanitary  disposal  and  hygiene  practices.  The 

mitigation measures for Water & Sanitation are as shown in the table below.

Annex: 8: AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY 
 
AGRICULTURE 
Problem statement and rationale 
 
The  country  has  continued  to  be  negatively  impacted  by  floods  in  the  past 

three  rain  seasons.      Every  year  the  plains  flood  to  some  extent,  but  in  late 

February  and  first  half  of  March  2009,  the  extent  of  floods  exceeded  the 

highest water levels ever recorded.  

The  above  normal  rains  season  received  led  to  flooding  that  left  a  trail  of 

destruction  of  field  crops,  infrastructure  and  thousands  of  people  and 

livestock were displaced.  Though the in-depth assessment show a marginal 

increase  in  crop  production  at  household  level,    these  household  have  been 

hit by floods for three consecutive seasons. This means that their production 

might  not sustain them  up to  the  next season  hence the  need to supplement 

their household food security through off season crop production. 

 
Floods and/or water logging have exposed the affected population to the risk 

of  outbreak  of  waterborne  diseases  and  increased  the  likelihood  of  animal 

disease  incidences.  The  damage  to  crops  has  contributed  to  food  insecurity 

problems in some the affected districts. Over the years floods have become a 

major development challenge because they tend to reverse the development 

process  and  livelihood  recoveries  in  the  various  sectors  particularly  in 

agriculture  where  household  asset  base  have  continued  to  be  eroded.  

Consequently  the  recovery  process  have  to  start  all  over  again,  begging  for 

fresh  interventions  and  infrastructure  development  and  rehabilitation.    In 

order  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  floods,  government  will  need  to 

 

52 

 

implement  short  to  medium  and  long-term  interventions  in  all  the  sectors 

identified to have been affected.  

 

ACTIVITIES 

The activities will address food insecurity and its related consequences such 

as  malnutrition,  morbidity  and  mortality.    In  terms  of  focus,  the  activities 

will  cover  off  season  crop  production  and  animal  health.    The  required 

interventions  are  as  summarized  in  the  activity  matrix  (Refer  to  table  20 

below).

Notes: 
The two provinces require early maturing maize seed varieties:  

â€¢  Option 1.  Preferred DACOs - MMV 441, or SC 504, SC 514 
â€¢  Option 2.  Sustainability considerations especially under low fertilizer availability; ZM 421 or ZM 521, i.e. low 

Nitrogen requirement varieties 

Early delivery of inputs separates success or failure

RELIEF FOOD 

Problem Statement and Rationale 

The  floods  of  2008/09  season  have  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  lives  of 

affected  communities.  According  to  the  In-  depth  Vulnerability  and  Needs 

Assessment  on  the  impact  of  floods  and/or  prolonged  dry  spells  conducted  by 

the  VAC  in  2009,  heavy  rains  and  floods  have  severely  affected  small  scale 

farmersâ€™ crops in 7 districts namely; Chavuma, Kabompo, Mporokoso, Mungwi, 

Mwinilunga, Serenje and Zambezi.  

 

Considering  the  negative  impact  of  excessive  rains  and  floods  on  the  seven 

districts, there is need to urgently address the resultant problems with specific 

interventions  that  will  mitigate  the  effects  of  loss  of  crops,  food  and  assets  of 

the  affected  households.  Interventions  that  include  relief  food,  provision  of 

agricultural inputs and vaccinating livestock will help address the core problems 

in the short, medium to long term. 

 

Activities 

The  following  three  activities  should  be  undertaken  to  mitigate  the  negative 

impact  of  heavy  rains  and  floods  on  food  security  in  the  severely  affected 

districts mentioned above. These activities are procurement, transportation and 

distribution of relief food   

 

Target 

A  total  of  110,  651  people  (18,442  households)  in  seven  (7)  affected  districts 

mentioned above will be targeted for relief food amounting to 8,295.5 MTs.
