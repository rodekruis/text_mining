Executive Summary 

 

The 2015 In – depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment was triggered by prolonged dry spells 
experienced  mainly  in the southern  half  of the country  between  February  and  March  2015. The 
Assessment  was  designed  to  understand  the  impact  of  these  prolonged  dry  spells  on  selected 
sectors  of  the  economy  in  forty-eight  (48)  districts  of  Central,  Copperbelt,  Eastern,  Luapula, 
Muchinga, Northwestern, Southern and Western Provinces.   

The  results  of  the  assessment  showed  that  the  main  livelihoods  for  most  people  in  the  assessed 
districts was farming where sixty (60) percent of households earned their incomes and food. The 
other  livelihoods  were  trading,  agriculture  wage  labour,  skilled  trade,  non-agricultural  wage 
labour and remiattances.  

The Assessment further determined that production of maize in most of the districts reduced by as 
much as 38 percent. The western province districts were the most affected indicating a loss of as 
much  as  41  percent  overall.  In  terms  of  carry  –  over  stock,  only  34.7  percent  of  households 
reported to have had stock from the previous season. When households were asked when cereal 
would run out, about 55.2 percent indicated that they would have no cereal by July. By the time 
the households start the lean period around November, 86.7 percent of the households would have 
run out of cereal. 

The  assessment  results  showed  that  there  were  variances  in  food  expenditure  share  across  the 
districts  covered.  In  this  regard,  majority  of  the  households  spent  most  of  their  money  on  food 
items.The results showed that 34.8 percent of the households had an expenditure share on food of 
between 51 and 75 percent. A further 34.1 percent of households had food expenditure shares of 
more than 75   percent. 

The  coping  strategies  index  (CSI)  showed  no  major  food  insecurity  stress  across  the  surveyed 
districts. This could be attributed to the period of the assessment when even the poor households 
are  able  to  access  own  food  production,  and  also  engage  in  agricultural labour  for  incomes  and 
food exchange. 

The  Assessment  showed  that  most  of  the  people  in  the  assessed  districts  have  acceptable  food 
consumption  scores  (52.7  percent)  followed  by  those  with  borderline  food  consumption  scores 
(24.6  percent).  The  Assessment  showed  that  most  of  the  people  in  the  assessed  districts  have 
acceptable  food  consumption  scores  (52.7  percent)  followed  by  those  with  borderline  food 
consumption scores (24.6 percent). 

Utilizing  a  composite  food  security  indicator  developed  by  the  Consolidated  Approach  for 
Reporting for Security which combined FCS, Expenditure share and coping behaviour, (CSI and 
FCS), 31 districts out of the 48 assessed districts, will require humanitarian assistance for part of 
the 2015/16 consumption season. Based on this, 798, 948 people in 31 districts will require relief 
food amounting to 53, 242 MT of cereal for eight months.  

In terms of health, there is need to strengthen Malaria Control Programs especially in the districts 
that  are  currently  showing  an  increase  in  malaria.  There  is  need  to  strengthen  water  quality 
monitoring in all the districts to ensure safe water sources of drinking.  

For  nutrition,  the  survey  results  showed  that  on  average  0.3  percent  of  households  in  the  entire 
district slept  hungry,  8.9  percent  ate  once  and  46.3  percent  ate  two times  the  day  preceding  the 

 

8 

 

survey. About 2.1 percent of the households in Shangombo, Ikelenge, Sikongo and Sioma had no 
meals  a  day  preceding  the  survey.  Sikongo  and  Sioma  recorded  the  highest  proportion  of 
households (50.7 percent and 34.6 percent respectively) who had one meal the day preceding the 
survey. Further, Lukulu and Nyimba showed that over 79 percent of the households ate two meals 
the  day  preceding  the  survey.  The  results  further  showed  that  in  terms  of  child  nutrition,  2.2 
percent children were at risk of severe wasting, 3.2 percent were at risk of moderate wasting and 
94 percent of the children were not at risk of wasting or death in the entire district. 

For water, sanitation and hygiene, the results showed that reported main water sources that were 
affected  (that  is  lower  water  level  than  in  previous  years  same  time)  is  2,  585,983  people  or 
430,997 households. The population that reported main water sources which dried up is 1,082,752 
people (180,459 households). 
 
A large number of households in the assessed districts did not have any toilets and practice open 
defecation.    The  population  which  reported  not  having  sanitation  facilities  stood  at  927,551 
people  (154,592  households).  Districts  where  households  do  not  have  sanitation  facilities  were 
mainly in Western Province. 
 
Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
Agriculture and Food Security 

Conclusion 

  No major productive assets were offloaded and/or sold in response to the prolonged dry 

spells. 

  Livelihood  diversity  still  remains  low  with  majority  of  the  households  in  the  assessed 
districts  dependent  on  agricultural  based  livelihoods  (e.g.  crop  production,  livestock 
rearing and agriculture wage labour). 

  The  permanent  and  seasonal  cash  incomes  in  the  assessed  districts  are  also  largely 

agricultural based mainly being sale of crops and agricultural wage labour. 

  Employment  of  moderate  to  high  cost  coping  mechanisms  was  high  across  most  of  the 

assessed districts (RCSI). 

  Prolonged dry spells did have an impact on household food production which ultimately 
will  affect  household  food  security  especially  as  households  move  towards  the  lean 
period. 

  Despite a slight increase in dietary diversity, the assessment showed that there is over  – 

dependency on carbohydrates (mainly maize and sweet potatoes). 

  Utilizing a composite index of FCS, Expenditure Share on food and coping behaviour, the 

results of the survey showed that 31 districts in six provinces would require assistance. 
 

 

Recommendations 

Short Term 

  A total of 798, 948 people (133, 158 households) from thirty one (31)districts will require 
food relief amounting to 53, 242 MT of maize equivalent for a period of eight (8) months 
(August  2015  –  March  2016).These  include:  Serenje  and  Chitambo  (Central);  Chadiza, 
Chipata,  Katete,  Lundazi,  Mambwe,  Nyimba,  Petauke,  Sinda,  Vubwi  (Eastern);  Samfya 
(Luapula)  Chikankata,  Gwembe,  Kazungula,  Pemba,  Sinazongwe  (Southern);  Ikelenge

(North Western) and Kalabo, Kaoma, Mulobezi, Senanga, Sesheke, Shangombo, Nalolo, 
Limulunga, Nkeyema, Sikongo, Sioma, Mwandi and Luampa (Western).  

  There  is  need  to  monitor  the  evolvement  of  the  food  security  situation  in  the  seventeen 
(17)  districts  as  most  of  them  fall  within  the  moderately  food  secure  district  with  a 
possibility of graduating into food insecurity as we approach the lean period. 

  There is need to strengthen the extension delivery system. 
 

Input provision for 45,079 households in twenty-seven (27) districts. 
 

Medium to Long Term 

  Livelihood  diversification programmes  be  scaled  up  in  order to contribute  to  alternative 

livelihoods. 

  Strengthen the support on conservation farming implementation. 
  There is need to introduce appropriate technologies for small – scale farmers which could 
enhance  household  food  security  such  as  water  harvesting  and  small  scale  irrigation 
systems. 

  There  is  need  to  enhance  the  monitoring  of  nutrition  and  food  security  through  the 

establishment of sentinel sites. 

  Child headed Households should be targeted for food security pack programs  
  Promote  asset  building  projects  among  the  child  headed  households  through  Youth 

empowerment funds. 

 Health 

Conclusion 

Malaria was the most common disease suffered by household members especially those in rural 
areas.  The  most  affected  districts  were:  Nkeyema,  Luampa,  Kaoma,  Ngabwe,  Mpika, 
Mwinilunga, Chama and Masaiti. The percentages of infection for diarrhoea, respiratory infection 
and other diseases were too low as a result they had no significant consequence on household’s 
livelihood.   

On health care seeking behavior, a bigger percentage of respondents who didn’t seek medication 
at all and those who took their own medication where those who suffered from malaria. There is 
need to increase the deployment of Community Health Assistants (CHAs) to communities so as to 
sensitize communities on the importance of making use of health facilities.   

Fever  and  ARI/cough  were  the  top  two  diseases  that  affected  the  under  five  children  in  the 
districts were the assessment took place. ARI/cough had 29 percent and fever had 27.2 percent.  

Recommendations 

Short term 

 

Increase  the  coverage  of  indoor-residual  spraying  and  effective  use  of  RDTs.for  the 
following  districts;  Nkeyema,  Luampa,  Kaoma,  Ngabwe,  Mpika,  Mwinilunga,  Chama,  
and Masaiti and  

  There is need to develop a Statutory Instrument on the use of ITNs. 

 

Medium  to Long term  

  Extending malaria surveillance to community level using an active case detection system 

for community level surveillance. 

  There  is  need  to  improve  on  the  supply  of  drugs  and  logistics  for  treatment  of 

respiratory infections (non-pneumonia). 

10 

 

 

 

  Recruit more Community Health Assistants (CHAs). 
  There is need to promote community based disease prevention mechanisms. 

Nutrition 

Conclusion 

The study  showed  that  most  of the  households  ate  two  meals  a  day  preceding  the  survey.  Most 
households that ate twice had normal meals and a reduction was seen among those that ate three 
meals  compared  to  their  normal  meals.  This  situation  could  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  most 
households reported having run out of food in 30 days preceding the survey and a reduction was 
observed among those who normally eat three meals.   

The  results  indicate  that  the  overall  wasting  was  less  than  6  percent,  however,  specific  districts 
data show high proportion of child wasting.   The results showed that children from large families 
and families headed by the young and the elderly had a higher chance of becoming wasted. Hence 
children in these households had a higher chance of dying.  The family size contributed to child 
wasting due to the intra household’s food distribution in households. Therefore, children between 
6 to 24 months in larger families and households headed by the elderly are at risk of being wasted 
in all the 48 districts.  

The  survey  established  that  about  three  quarters  of  the  children  who  were  severely  wasted  had 
fever,  cough  and  diarrhea  while  all  the  children  who  were  moderately  wasted  had  all  the  three 
illnesses. This shows that these illness might have contributed to the wasting state of the children. 
Studies have shown that illnesses such as diarrhea increases the nutrient loss from the body and 
reduces appetite hence reducing the food intake and increasing the likelihood of wasting. 

Further,  the  survey  revealed  that  interventions  such  as  supplementary  and  therapeutic  feeding 
were  only  available  in  few  districts  with  limited  coverage  in  each  of  the  districts.  Therefore, 
vulnerable children would have been missed at targeting stage of the intervention.  

 
Recommendations 

Short term  

  Children  in  the  moderate  and  severe  wasted  should  be  considered  for 
supplementary  and  therapeutic  feeding.    The  feeds  should  provide  adequate 
nutrient requirement for the children. The targeting should consider Child headed 
households, households headed by the elderly and children from larger families. 

  The child rations should be large enough to support the food needs of the women. 
This  will  take  care  of  the  intra  household’s  food  distribution  in  the  households 
since  most  wasted  children  normally  come  from  the  poorest  segments  of  the 
population. 

  There  is  need  to  intensify  the  monitoring  of  nutritional  status  of  children  and 
mothers to detect under - nutrition early and target support towards the vulnerable 
households in the communities. 

  Scale up the supplementary feeding programs and therapeutic programs to cover 

vulnerable districts where wasting is high among children and women.  

11 

 

 

 

 

 

Medium term  

  Promote  food  diversification  to  help  in  promoting  diet  diversity  among  the 

households 

  Promote food storage for consumption and advocate for less sale on food assets 

from communities who depend on own production for livelihood. 

  Promote infant feeding programs in the community. 
 

 Improve the service delivery to reduce childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and 
malaria. 

 Water, Sanitation and Hygiene 

Conclusion 

  The population which reported main water sources that were affected (that is lower water 
level than in previous years same time) is 2, 585,983 people or 430,997 households. The 
population  that  reported  main  water  sources  which  dried  up  is  1,082,752  people  or 
180,459 households. 

 

  The  worst  affected  districts  were  Kaoma,  Kalabo,  Mitete,  Sikongo,  Sioma  and  Luampa 
(Western Province); Mwinilunga and Ikelenge (North-Western Province); Vubwi, Sinda, 
Chipta,  Chadiza,  Petauke  and  Lundazi  (Eastern  Province);  Zimba,  Namwala,  Gwembe, 
Kazungula,  Choma,  Kalomo  (Southern  Province);  Lufwanyama  (Copperbelt  Province); 
and Mafinga and Mpika (Muchinga Province).  

  Majority of households in the surveyed districts did not treat their drinking water. 
  A  large  number  of  households  in  the  assessed  districts  did  not  have  any  toilets  and 
practice open defeacation.  The population which reported not having sanitation facilities 
stood  at  927,551  people  (154,592  households).  Districts  where  households  do  not  have 
sanitation facilities were mainly in Western Province. 

  Most  of  the  households  washed  their  hands  with  the  commonest  scouring  agents  used 

being soap and ash.  
 

 
Recommendations 

Short – term (WASH) 
In  terms  of  water  sources  (working  in  liaison  with  MMEWD,  MLGH,  MOCTA,  D-WASHE, 
DDMC and Satellite Disaster Management Committees): 

  Assess and search for new water sources in needy areas; 
  Drill  boreholes  in  areas  where  water  points  (21  percent)  have  dried  and  where  the 

distance from household to water point is more than 500m; and 

  Continuous  monitoring  the  situation  in  case  of  more  water  points  drying  out  and 

determining alternative water sources. 

  Plan for operation and maintenance of existing water infrastructure. 

 

In terms of sanitation facilities and Hygiene (working with MLGH, MOCTA, MOH, MCDMCH, 
D-WASHE, DDMC and Satellite Disaster Management Committees): 

 

12 

 

 

  Construct  demonstration  latrines  at  the  schools,  health  centres,  rural  community  centres 
(markets,  faith  centers,  and  traditional  chiefs’  palaces)  as  well  as latrines for  vulnerable 
households. Work with households to build robust and appropriate latrine versions from 
the start, even though the latrines may be basic.  

  The  government  at  national,  provincial  and  districts  levels  should  encourage  the 
formation  of  a  practical  WASH  Chiefdom  and  Community  Action  Plans  for  improving 
WASH access generally; 

  Promoting  CLTS,  monitoring  and  maintaining  ODF  status,  maintaining  a  clean 
environment generally, and Make use of traditional leaders, local religious leaders and the 
influence  and  opportunities  they  have  in  bringing  messages  of  personal  cleanliness  and 
well-being to their community.  

  There  is  need  to  increase  availability  of  chlorine  at  rural  health  centers    level  in  all  the 

affected districts 

o  Create WASH awareness programme. 

Medium and long term (WASH) 
 

In terms of sanitation facilities and Hygiene (working with MLGH, MOCTA, MOH, MCDMCH, 
D-WASHE, DDMC and Satellite Disaster Management Committees): 

  Community  involvement  in  planning,  design  and  construction  of  water  infrastructure 

(e.g., small dams and ancillary works) and in watershed management 

  Piloting and promoting of water supply and sanitation technology options that are climate 

resilient. 

 
In terms of sanitation facilities and Hygiene (working with MLGH, MOCTA, MOH, MCDMCH, 
D-WASHE, DDMC and Satellite Disaster Management Committees): 

  Provide  external  technical  advice  in  challenging  environments  while  ensuring  full 
consultation  with  beneficiaries  regarding  technical  challenges  and  solutions.  Some 
“Smart”  subsidies  could  be  targeted  to  particularly  vulnerable  groups  (including  cash 
transfers), or to households facing significant technical and physical challenges to latrine 
building (mason/ artisan technical support).  

  Build  sanitation  shops  at  District/Chiefdom  level  to  sell  sanitation  facilities  and  give 

advice on improved sanitation facility construction, operation and maintenance

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION 

1.1.  Background 
 

According  to  the  Zambia  Rainfall  forecast  issued  in  September  2014  for  the  2014/2015 
rainfall  season,  most  parts  of  the  country  had  a  likelihood  of  receiving  normal  rainfall 
during the period October to December 2014 with isolated pockets expected to receive 
normal  to  below  normal  rainfall.  The  forecast  further  indicated  that  normal  to  above 
normal rainfall was likely to be received during the period January to March 2015.   
 
Figure 1: Start of Season Anomaly 

Contrary to the forecast issued, the country experienced mixed rainfall performance with 
an early on-set confined to the Northern, Luapula, some parts of North Western and

The  rest  of  the  country  (Central,  Copperbelt,  Eastern,  Lusaka  and  Muchinga  Provinces) 
experienced a late onset (figure 1) with much of the rains received during the 3rd dekad 
(21-31) of December 2014.  It is worth noting that January 2015 had normal rainfall. Dry 
spells set in at the beginning of February 2015 and continued into March 2015 affecting 
Western (all districts), Southern (all districts), Eastern Province (all districts), some parts 
of  Central,  Luapula,  Muchinga,  North-western  and  Lusaka  Provinces  being  severely 
affected.  The  prolonged  dry  spells  coupled  with  poor  rainfall  distribution  shortened  the 
growing  season  (figure  2).    This  scenario  is  likely  to  compromise  the  food  security 
situation  in  the  country  at  both  national  and  household  levels.  Hydrological  indicators 
showed that provinces such as Central, Eastern, Western, Southern and Lusaka Provinces 
are likely to have challenges of accessing water for domestic and other uses. Furthermore, 
the  lack  of  adequate  water  in  the  water  bodies  is  likely  to  negatively  impact  power 
generation in the country which might result into longer load – shedding hours.  
 
 
The  2015  In-depth  and  Needs  Assessment  therefore  sought  to  understand  the  impact  of 
the dry spells experienced in Zambia on selected sectors of the economy. This was done 
through the capture of information relating to the causative agents, vulnerability drivers, 
numbers of elements at risk, coping strategies being utilized and the possible solutions to 
the shock (both short and long term). This assessment covered forty-eight (48) districts in 
Central,  Copperbelt,  Eastern,  Luapula,  Muchinga,  Northwestern,  Southern  and  Western 
Provinces. (Refer to Annex 1 for Assessed districts).

CHAPTER TWO: METHODOLOGY 

 

2.1. Identifying Areas to be assessed 
 
An Integrated Context Analysis (ICA) was done to determine the districts to assess. The 
key indicators used for the selection of hotspots district included rainfall performance and 
anticipated  crop  losses  with  food  insecurity  frequency,  poverty  incidences  and  field 
reports  from  the  District  Disaster  Management  Committees  (DMMCs)  used  as  trailing 
indicators. The following parameters shown in the table below were used:

2.2. Target Population 
 

2.2.1. Target Population 

The  target  population  is  the  number  of  people  living  in  the  districts  identified  to  have 
been affected by prolonged dry spells that occurred during the 2014/2015 rainfall season. 
A total of forty-eight (48) districts were targeted. 

2.2.2. Sampling Frame 

Sampling  frames  are  lists  or  enumeration  procedures  that  allow  identifying  every 
individual  of  the  target  population  (Kish,  1965;  Kalton,  1983).The  simplest  form  of  a 
sample frame is a target population list or database in which each individual of the target 
population is uniquely identified.  

Zambia is administratively divided into ten (10) provinces. Each province is in turn sub-
divided  into  districts.  Each  district  is  further  sub-divided  into  constituencies  and  wards. 
For statistical purposes, each ward is subdivided into Census Supervisory Areas (CSAs) 
which, in turn, are sub-divided into Standard Enumeration Areas (SEAs). The SEAs are 
geographical  areas,  classified  as  either  rural  or  urban,  have  information  on  number  of 
households  and  the  population  size.  This  demarcation  is  done  through  a  mapping 
exercise.  
 
Prior to the 2010 Census of Population and Housing, the Central Statistical Office (CSO)-
Zambia conducted a mapping exercise. Based on the Census results, data collected during 
the mapping exercise was updated.  
 
The national frame has an updated list of Standard Enumeration Areas (SEAs). The frame 
has 25,631 SEAs and 2,815, 897 households. A listing of SEAs in all the forty-eight (48) 
districts  was  the  sampling  main  frame  for  the  2015  In-Depth  Vulnerability  and 
Assessment Survey. The SEAs were the primary sampling units for the survey. 
 
2.2.3. Sample allocation 

The survey targeted forty-eight (48) districts in  eight (8) provinces. Provision of precise 
survey estimates for each district required that samples of adequate sizes be allocated to 
each district. Since it was desired that estimates from each district have the same level of 
precision, an equal allocation was the most efficient strategy. 

Therefore, an equal sample of 15 clusters or 150 households was allocated to each of the 
forty-eight (48) districts. 

2.2.4. Sampling Method 

The 2015 In-Depth Vulnerability and Assessment Survey employed probability sampling 
procedures.  A  two-stage  stratified  cluster  sample  design  was  used.  In  the  first  stage,  15 
SEAs  were  selected  using  the  Probability  Proportional  to  Estimated  Size  (PPES) 
procedure.  During  the  second  stage,  10  households  were  randomly  selected  from  each 
enumeration  area.  Random  does  not  in  any  way  imply  haphazard;  rather  it  means  that 
each possible household had an equal chance of being selected. 

 

 

 

18 

 

2.2.5. Sample Size 

A  total  of  6,  906  households  in  609  SEAs  were  covered  in  the  48  districts  with  an 
estimated population of 5,140,795 people.  

 
2.2.6. Weighting Procedure 
 
Sampling  weights  are  needed  to  compensate  for  unequal  selection  probabilities,  non-
coverage, non-response, and for known differences between the sample and the reference 
population. Thus sample weights act as boosting factors to represent the number of units 
in the survey population that are accounted for by the sample unit to which the weight is 
assigned.  

 
2.2.7. Base Weights 
 
The  first  type  of  weight  that  is  normally  calculated  is  the  design  weight,  also  known  as 
base  weight.  Construction  of  the  base  weights  for  the  sampled  units  corrects  for  their 
unequal  probabilities  of  selection.  The  base  weight  of  a  sampled  unit  is  the  number  of 
units in the population that are represented by the sampled unit for purposes of estimation 
(UNSTATS,  2005).  It  is  derived  as  a  reciprocal  of  the  probability  of  selection  for 
inclusion in the sample. 

Since  a  two-stage  sample  design  was  used  for  the  2015  In-Depth  Vulnerability  and 
Assessment  Survey,  the  base  weights  were  constructed  to  reflect  the  probabilities  of 
selection at each stage. 

a)  Probability of selecting a primary sampling unit (1st Stage). 

The primary sampling unit for the survey was a SEA. Its probability of selection is 
given by; 
 

 

Where: 

 

Ph= probability of selection for the i-th sampled EA in district h 
mh= number of sample EAs selected in district h. 
Nhi= total number of households for the i-th sampled EA in district h. 
Nh= total number of households in district h. 

b)  Probability of selecting a household (2nd Stage) 

The probability of selecting a household was given by; 
 

 

Where: 

 

19 

 

 
 
 

Phi= probability of selection for the i-th sampled household in SEA h 
mh= number of households selected in SEA h. 
Nhi= total number of households for the SEA h. 

c)  Overall probability of selecting a household 

The  overall  probability  of  selecting  a  household  is  given  as  the  product  of  the 
probabilities of selection at the first and second stages of selection. The formula is 
given below; 
 

 

 
Therefore, the base weight 
 

was calculated as below; 

 

2.2.8. Reliability of Estimates 

Reliability  of  estimates  in  the  2015  In-Depth  Vulnerability  and  Assessment  Survey  was 
affected by both sampling and non-sampling errors. 

 

 

 

Sampling error is the part of the difference between a population value and an estimate 
thereof, derived from a random sample, which is due to the fact that only a sample of values is 
observed. Sampling errors arise from the fact that not all units of the targeted population are 
enumerated, but only a sample of them. Therefore, the information collected on the units in the 
sample may not perfectly reflect the information which could have been collected on the whole 
population. The difference is the sampling error. EUROSTAT 
 

To  reduce  sampling  errors,  a  sufficient  sample  size  was  determined  for  this  survey. 
Sampling errors were further minimized by using a stratified sample design. The sample 
was explicitly stratified into 48 strata and implicit stratification was provided ordering or 
sorting the list of SEAs for each strata. 

 

 

 

 

Non-Sampling error is an error in sample estimates which cannot be attributed to sampling 
fluctuations. Non-sampling errors may arise from many different sources such as defects in the 
frame, faulty demarcation of sample units, defects in the selection of sample units, mistakes in 
the collection of data due to personal variations or misunderstanding or bias or negligence or 
dishonesty on the part of the investigator or of the interviewer, mistakes at the stage of the 
processing of the data, etc. OECD 
 

Non-sampling  errors  may  have  arisen  from  many  factors  at  all  stages  of  data  collection 
and processing. These include errors resulting from; 

Incorrect presentation of the questions 

  Respondents misunderstanding the questions 
 
  Question specific non-response; 
  Errors in data entry, and  
  Errors during coding. 

 

20 

 

The report therefore contains no quantitative assessments of these errors. Although it was 
not possible to eliminate all sources of error, a high level of control on all known sources 
of  error  was  done  efficiently  and  effectively  in  planning  and  conducting  the  survey. 
Below  are  the  key  steps  that  were  taken  to  minimize  or  control  non-sampling  errors 
during the survey:  

  The  most  recent  sampling  frame,  based  on  the  2010  Census  of  Population  and 

Housing was used.  

  Thoroughly testing questionnaires before being used in the field.  
  Non-responding households were followed up to achieve high response rates.  
  High  quality  editing  and  cleaning  procedures  were  employed  in  processing  the 

 

data.  
International standard procedures and processes were employed at all stages of the 
survey process.  

 

2.3. Food Needs Computation 
 

Determining the Food Insecure Districts and Number of persons in Need 
 
In  determining  the  food  insecure  districts,  a  composite  indicator  combining  Food 
Consumption Score (FCS), Expenditure Share on food and coping behaviour was utilized. 
The  cut  –  offs  used  are  in  line  with  the  Consolidated  Approach  for  Reporting  Food 
Security Indicators (CARI). 

 
 
To determine the amount of maize equivalent required by affected persons largely, the 
formula below was used; 
 

 

 
Where:  
F = Total Maize Equivalent required in Metric Tonnes 
N = Total number of the affected persons  
R = Individual ration size per Kilogram per month (250 grammes per person per day) 
M = Recommended number of months for the food

CHAPTER THREE: CONTEXT 

 
3.1. The Economy 

The country's economy in 2014 remained stable with real GDP growth rate of 6 percent. 
This growth is consistent with the vision 2030 of becoming a middle income prosperous 
nation.  Investment  in  the  mining  sector  continued  to  drive  other  sectors  especially 
construction, transport and energy. According to the 2013 Economic report, the economy 
is expected to grow by 5.8 percent in 2015 and while 6.4 percent in 2016.  Despite robust 
economic  performance,  poverty  remained  high  at  over  60  percent  with  some 
improvements in urban areas.  
 
Zambia  amended  its  corporate  tax  rates  for  mining  firms  in  2015  from  20  percent  to  9 
percent.  This means that a roll-back in tax rates is expected to cost US$310 million and 
government  expects  to  offset  this  income  reduction  by  cutting  expenditure  and  external 
borrowing. 
 
The country's monetary policy focused on sustaining stability by maintaining single digit 
inflation  while  ensuring  adequate  liquidity  for  the  growing  economy.  The  country's 
inflation  rate experienced a decline  from  last  year with  7.9 percent in  May,  2014 to  6.9 
percent  in  May,  2015.  The  decline  is  due  to  the  decreases  in  non-food  items  mainly 
purchase motor vehicles and air fares.  Annual food inflation decreased from 8.0 percent 
in May 2014 to 7.2 percent in May, 2015. The increase was due to increases in the prices 
of vegetables.  
 
In terms of the exchange rate, the country experienced a rapid depreciation of the Kwacha 
against major currencies, reaching a high of K7 per US dollar in May, 2014. This has not 
changed  much  during  May,  2015  with  the  exchange  rate  being  at  K7.1  per  dollar.  The 
unemployment rate has reduced from 19 percent in 2012 to 15 percent in 2015. 
 

3.2. Agriculture and Food Security 

 

The Zambian government has placed agriculture as one of the key priority sectors that can 
make  significant  contribution  to  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  In 
this regard,  a number of initiatives are being implemented. The sector is  given this pre-
eminence because 60 percent of the population derives its livelihood from agriculture. In 
addition, the country is endowed with abundant natural resources such as arable land and 
adequate water bodies, forming a basis for a viable sector.  
 
In order to fully exploit this agricultural potential, Zambia has developed well articulated 
agricultural  policies and  strategies which  emphasize  on objectives such as attainment  of 
food  security,  maximizing  farmers’  incomes,  promoting  sustainable  agriculture,  and 
enhancing  private  sector  roles  in  input  and  output  markets.  The  National  Agriculture 
Investment  Plan  (NAIP,  2013)  emphasizes  liberalization,  commercialization,  and 
promotion of public – private partnerships and provision of effective agricultural services 
that ensures sustainable agricultural growth. To strengthen agricultural policy further, the 

 

22 

 

National  Agricultural  Policy  has  been  reviewed  to  support  the  implementation  of  the 
National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP). 
 
However, past and present agricultural policies have tended to promote maize production 
at the expense of other crops and agricultural related enterprises. This has led to majority 
of small – scale farmers venturing in mainly only one enterprise thereby increasing their 
exposure to the risk of crop failure due to negative impacts of climate change. Further, the 
small  –  scale  farmers  rely  heavily  on  rain-fed  agriculture  and  cultivate  mostly  less  than 
two hectares which heightens their exposure to crop failure. 
 
Despite  the  agricultural  sector  recording  increased  investments  exceeding  the  ten  (10) 
percent  CAADP  threshold,  sixty  (60)  percent  of  the  investments  in  the  sector  goes  to 
support  two  programs  namely;  the  Farmers  Input  Support  Program  and  Food  Reserve 
Agency.  This  leaves  a  paltry  forty  (40)  percent  to  support  other  programs  such  as 
Research,  Extension,  Crop  production  and  diversification,  Irrigation,  Livestock  and 
Fisheries  which  are  the  key  drivers  of  the  sector.  This  has  led  to  low  output  from 
Research and Development, expensive and limited uptake of appropriate technologies for 
small – scale farmers leading to low production and productivity as well as utilization of 
inappropriate  and  expensive  breeding  stock.  The  area  under  irrigation  still  remains  low 
with  majority  of  smallholders  not  able  to  afford  irrigation  technologies.  Investment  in 
value addition especially at the farm household level has also eluded the sector. This has 
had a negative impact on household incomes, food security and nutrition. The situation is 
worsened by the lack of essential infrastructure leading to post harvest losses and failure 
to connect to main markets.  
 
The  Government  has  however  put  in  place  a  number  of  initiatives  to  counteract  this 
situation and build resilience at the household level. The Government intends to redesign 
the  Farmer  Input  Support  Programme  (FISP),  strengthen  research,  invest  in  irrigation, 
rehabilitate  and  develop  rural  infrastructure,  reform  the  agricultural  marketing  system, 
promote  crop  diversification  and  value  addition.  In  an  effort  to  improve  smallholder 
productivity  and  production,  Government  has  continued  to  support  farmers  through  the 
Farmer  Input  Support  Programme  (FISP).  During the 2014/2015  farming  season, a total 
number  of  900,000  farmers  was  targeted  with  each  beneficiary  getting  four  (4)  bags  of 
fertilizer  and  10kg  of  maize  seed.  In  addition  12,700  farmers  were  targeted  for  the  rice 
pack, 23,820 for sorghum and 67,855 farmers were targeted for the groundnut packs. 

 
To  improve  livestock  and  fisheries  governance,  the  Government  is  developing  the  two 
policy  documents  for  livestock  and  fisheries  policies  respectively.  To  combat  micro-
nutrient  deficiency  particularly  in  children  and  women  of  the  child  bearing  age, 
government has developed nutrient- dense crops (such as Orange Maize, Orange Fleshed 
Sweet potatoes, and iron/zinc beans) through bio-fortification.  
  
Furthermore,  Government  realizes  that  hazards  such  as  prolonged  dry  spells  will  be 
worsened by climate change and thus to counter its effects, adaptation programmes such 
as  promotion  of  conservation  agriculture,  livelihoods  diversification  and  provision  of 
water harvesting infrastructure have been put in place.  
 
 

 

23 

 

In tackling these hindrances to increased agricultural contribution to the country’s growth, 
the  Government  hopes  to  ensure  that  benefits  of  improved  agricultural  output  reach  the 
poorest  rural  households  and  consequently  the  country  at  large  will  begin  to  register 
reductions in the current poverty levels. 
 
Government  through  the  Food  Reserve  Agency  (FRA)  maintains  the  Strategic  Food 
Reserve  to  cover  for  three  months  of  national  consumption.  In  addition  to  this  role,  the 
FRA  is  a  major  player  in  maize  marketing.  In  the  current  marketing  year,  FRA  has 
targeted  to  purchase  500,000  MT  of  maize  from  small  scale  farmers  residing  mainly  in 
outlying areas. 

Crop Production, Food Supply and Access 
 
Maize continued to rank very high in the country’s crop performance with area put under 
the  crop  increasing  by  5.3  percent  during  the  2014/2015  production  season.  The 
production levels of other crops have remained comparatively low. During the 2014/2015 
season,  production  was  mixed  with  some  crops  recording  significant  increases  while 
others  experienced  notable  drops.    Due  to  the  extended  dry  spells  experienced  in  the 
southern half of the country during the growing season, official production estimates from 
the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock show a significant drop (22 percent) in maize 
production.  This  has  been  partly  attributed  to  poor  productivity  levels  among  small  – 
scale  farmers  and  also  due  to  wilting  of  the  crop  due  to  the  prolonged  dry  spells 
experienced  during  the  season.  According  to  official  government  estimates,  maize 
production for the 2014/2015 production season has been pegged at 2.62 million MT.  

The erratic rainfall experienced in the country resulted in a reduction in the area harvested 
for  maize  in  almost  all  the  provinces.  Although  the  impact  on  crops  was  severe  in  the 
southern half, the effects of the deficit will be masked by the good levels of carry – over 
stocks.  Similar  to  maize,  rice  output  for  the  2014/2015  production  season  has  been 
estimated to decline by as much as 48.6 percent with respect to the previous season.

A quick analysis of production for the last two production seasons (figure 3) shows that 
Central, Copperbelt, Eastern, Lusaka, Southern and Western Provinces are likely to have 
localized food insecurity. 

National Food Supply for the 2014/2015 Season 
 
The  National  Food  Balance  sheet  for  the  2015/2016  marketing  season  released  by  the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAL) shows that the country has produced more 
than  sufficient  maize  to  meet  the  total  national  requirement.  National  maize  production 
has been estimated at 2, 618, 401MT, while the unusually large carryover stock stands at 
1,  345,  401  MT  giving  a  total  maize  availability  of  3,963,622MT.  The  country’s  total 
requirement stands at 3, 086, 854 MT implying that Zambia has a maize surplus of 876, 
768 MT which will be available for export.

Similar to past years, sorghum, millet and cassava are expected to be adequately available 
to  meet  domestic  requirements  this  year  while  an  estimated  12,583MT  of  rice  imports 
will be needed to meet the national shortfall.

Food Access 
 
The food security situation during the 2015/ 2016 marketing and consumption period for 
the  country  is  projected  to  remain  stable  due  to  previous  successive  years  of  surplus 
production.  However,  decline  in  rice,  soya  beans,  sweet  potatoes  and  groundnuts 
production coupled with high demand for maize in the region may affect access of these 
food stuffs at household level.  At national level, there are adequate food supplies to meet 
the  dietary  needs  of  the  majority  of  the  people  though  this  may  be  a  challenge  for 
household  food  security.  This  phenomenon  will  however,  be  cushioned  by  surplus  food 
production  from  the  Northern  half  of  the  country.  The  prices  for  staple  food  have 
remained  stable  in  the  last  twelve  months  guaranteeing  accessibility  by  all  people  at  all 
times.  Even if food will be relatively accessible on the market, people will have to walk 
long  distances  to  purchase  the  staple  food  due  to  decreased  crop  production.  This  will 
eventually lead to high demand for cereals in areas that experienced prolonged dry spells 
during the 2014/ 2015 season. Government through the Food Reserve Agency and private 
sector  will  be  expected  to  play  a  critical  role  in  purchasing  and  selling  cereals  closer  to 
the  affected  communities.  Further,  food  access  may  be  affected  by  increased  prices  in 
food  commodities  as  majority  of  the  rural  households  will  have  inadequate  income  to 
meet their daily food requirements. 
 
Livestock Situation 
 
Livestock  production  continues  to  be  a  major  livelihood  among  small  scale  farmers  in 
many  parts  of  the  country.  The  production  of  major  livestock  such  as  cattle,  goats  and 
pigs is concentrated in three provinces, namely Central, Southern and Western Provinces. 
Based on the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock statistics, cattle have the largest share 
of  the  major  livestock  population  at  55%,  with  goats  at  35%  while  pigs  make  up  only 
10%.  In  the  past  number  of  years,  cattle  production  has  severely  been  disrupted  by 
recurring disease outbreaks, with the  common  ones  being  Foot  and  Mouth  Disease  
(FMD),  East  Coast  Fever,  Contagious  Bovine Pleuro-pneumonia (CBPP) and Anthrax. 
The  FMD  is  endemic  in  Sesheke  (Western  Province),  Kazungula  (Southern  Province), 
Mbala and Nakonde (Northern Province), but in 2004 spread to parts of Central and other 
districts  in  Southern  Province.  CBPP  is  endemic  in  some  areas  of  Western  Province, 
North-  western,  Southern  (Kazungula)  and  extreme  Northern  Province  Districts.  East 
Coast  Fever  areas  include  Eastern,  Southern,  Central,  Lusaka  and  Northern  Provinces 
while  outbreaks  of  Anthrax  are  mostly  confined  to  Western  Province.  Last  year,  the 
country  also  experienced  sporadic  outbreaks  of  African  Swine  fever  in  Copperbelt, 
Eastern, Lusaka, North Western and Southern provinces. Under normal circumstances, in 
these farming systems, livestock acts as some form of insurance against poor weather and 
subsequent  crop  failure  while  also  providing  the  farmers  with  income  during  difficult 
times.

3.3 Health 

 
Zambia recognizes health as one of the priority sectors that contribute to the well-being of 
the nation and, therefore, remains committed to providing quality health services to all its 
citizens.  Recognizing  that  a  healthy  population  is  critical  to  improved  production  and 
productivity,  Zambia  will  continue  investing  in  the  health  sector,  in  order  to  ensure 
sustainability  of  the  nation’s  human  capital  base,  required  for  sustainable  economic 
growth. 
 
The Zambian government is implementing wide-ranging health sector reforms, aimed at 
attaining equity of access to assured cost-effective quality health services, as close to the 
family as possible. These reforms are based on a system of health sector plans. 
 
 
The  health  sector  plans  and  documents  seek  to  provide  the  strategic  framework  for  the 
efficient and effective organization, coordination and management of the health sector in 
Zambia. This is  aimed at improving the health status of the Zambian population, in line 
with the national, regional and global health objectives and targets, particularly the Vision 
2030 for Zambia and the health related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  
 
Zambia has a high burden of disease, which is  mainly  characterized by  high prevalence 
and  impact  of  communicable  diseases,  particularly,  malaria,  HIV  and  AIDS,  STIs,  and 
TB,  and  high  maternal,  neonatal  and  child  morbidities  and  mortalities.    The  country  is 
also faced with  a rapidly rising burden of non-communicable diseases, including mental 
health, diabetes, cardio-vesicular diseases and violence. 
 
The country is also faced with a high burden of Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health 
(MNCH)  problems,  and  a  growing  problem  of  Non-Communicable  Diseases  (NCDs), 
including mental health, cancers, sickle cell anaemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and 
heart diseases, chronic respiratory disease, blindness and eye refractive defects, and moral 
health  problems.  Currently,  the  top  10  causes  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  Zambia 
include  malaria,  respiratory  infections  (non-pneumonia),  diarrhoea  (non-blood),  trauma 
(accidents,  injuries,  wounds  and  burns),  eye  infections,  skin  infections,  respiratory 
infections (pneumonia), ear, nose and throat infections, intestinal worms and anaemia.  
 
The  country  is  also  faced  with  the  high  burden  of  the  HIV&AIDS  epidemic,  which  has 
significantly impacted on the morbidity and mortality levels across the country.  
 
The  health  of  individuals  and  communities  is,  to  a  large  extent,  determined  by  the 
environments  and  circumstances  in  which  they  live  and  operate.  These  factors  are 
commonly referred to as the determinants of health and include: the social and economic 
environment;  the  physical  environment;  and  the  person’s  individual  characteristics, 
behaviour  and  circumstances.  Even  though  most  of  these  factors  are  beyond  the  normal 
scope of the health sector, it is the responsibility of the health sector to ensure that such 
factors are considered and included in the health sector and national development agenda, 
in order to promote good health and quality of life of the population. In Zambia, the key 
determinants of health manifest differently and contribute to the high burden of disease. 
 
Water  and  Sanitation  which  is  poor  access  to  safe  water  and  good  sanitation,  poor 
housing and unsafe food has continued to drive various diseases. Limited access to water 
and  sanitation  facilities  accompanied  by  poor  hygiene  is  associated  with  skin  diseases, 

27 

 

 

acute  respiratory  infections  (ARIs),  and  diarrhoeal  diseases,  the  leading  preventable 
diseases.  ARI  and  diarrhoeal  diseases  are  among  the  leading  causes  of  child  deaths  in 
Zambia  (MoH,  2012).The  Zambia  Demographic  and  Health  Survey  2013-14  (ZDHS 
2013-14)  indicates  that  only  64.5percent  of  the  households  in  Zambia  have  access  to 
improved sources of water. Households in urban areas are more likely to  have access to 
improved  sources  of  water  than  those  in  rural  areas  (89.5percent  compared  with 
46.6percent). Overall, 54 percent  of households in  Zambia have no toilet  facilities. This 
problem  is  more  common  in  rural  areas  (74.2percent)  than  in  urban  areas  (27percent). 
Climate  change  is  also  another  major  global  threat  to  health,  and  is  becoming  a  major 
problem for Zambia. Therefore, the Zambia government recognises the need to harmonise 
the  different  sectoral  development  strategies,  through  a  National  Climate  Change 
Response Strategy. 
 
This plan for mitigating the impacts of several climatic and variable conditions will take 
the preventive, promotive and treatment  approach to address both anticipated conditions 
when  water  is  scarce  and  treat  conditions  existing  in  the  population,  including  health 
promotion  to  address  life  style/behaviour  which  facilitates  disease  transmission. 
Therefore it’s a three tier plan to  reduce  further  vulnerability of the populations already 
affected by weather events in the 2014/2015 rainy season and beyond. 

 
As a general rule, the risk of epidemic after a disaster is related to the endemic levels of 
diseases  in  the  population.  These  include  diarrhea  and  dysentery,  cholera,  measles, 
whooping  cough,  meningococcal  meningitis,  tuberculosis,  malaria,  intestinal  parasites, 
scabies and other skin diseases, louse borne typhus and relapsing fever. Broadly these are 
water washed, water borne and water related diseases. 
 
 
3.4 Nutrition 
 
Adequate nutrition is the pillar of any economic developmental programme for a country. 
Under malnutrition is an intense global problem that has been made worse by high levels 
of poverty which has depleted poor’s ability to access resources that can help them access 
adequate diets. As a result, under nutrition has become evident in most countries though 
over nutrition has currently become a measure of public health problems.   High levels of 
malnutrition,  particularly  under-nutrition  which  includes  stunting,  wasting,  underweight 
and  micronutrient  deficiencies  among  children  under  five  years    and  women  of  child 
bearing age hold back the country's socio-economic development and potential to reduce 
poverty. 
 
 
Stunting 
 
Stunting prevalence of 40 percent among children under -five  years of age in Zambia is 
closer to the African average level of 42percent1. Stunting among Zambian children starts 
in  early  months,  rapidly  increases  after  six  months  of  age  and  reaches  the  pick  of  59 
percent at 18 to 23 months of age, then declines to 40percent among 24 to 59 months old

children.  This  trend  is  due  to  poor  quality  of  complementary  feeds  provided  to  the 
children after 6 months of age2.  
 
Under weight  
 
The  ZDHS  2013-2014  shows  that  the  prevalence  of  underweight  among  children  under 
five years of age in Zambia has decreased from 25 percent in 1992 to 15 percent in 2014. 
The proportion of underweight children reaches its highest peak among children aged 18-
23 months (18 percent) then reduces after 23 months. 
 
Wasting 
 
According  to  the  ZHDS  2013-2014,  Zambia  has  consistently  maintained  the  wasting 
levels among children under five between 5 and 6 percent from1992 to 2014 period which 
shows  a  peak  at  9  to  11  months  of  age.  Wasting  prevalence  in  Zambia  varies  slightly 
between urban (4 percent) and rural children (6 percent) DHS. 
 
Under nutrition among women  
 
Wasting  among  women  of  child  bearing  age  in  Zambia  has  been  evident  among  10 
percent  of  the  women  in  the  country  from  2007  to  2014,  however  ZDHS  (2013-2014) 
shows  that  overweight  among  the  women  has  increased  from  12  percent  in  1992  to  23 
percent in 2014. 
Maternal  and  child  under  nutrition  are  caused  by  multiple  factors,  and  addressing  the 
problems  therefore  requires  the  collaboration  between  a  wide  range  of  actors  from 
different sectors, working at all levels from community to national level3. 
 
Micronutrient malnutrition 
 
In  Zambia,  micronutrient  deficiencies  are  highly  prevalent  among  infants  and  young 
children  aged  6-24  months  and  pregnant  and  lactating  women.  The  most  common 
micronutrient  deficiencies’  includes  Vitamin  A,  iron,  and  zinc.  The  2003  survey  on 
micronutrient  malnutrition  showed  that  53.3  percent  of  children  and  13.4  percent  of 
women  were  deficient.  In  terms  of  iron  deficiency  anemia,  this  remains  a  major  public 
health  concern.  Prevalence  of  anemia  was  53  percent  among  under-five  children.    The 
recent survey done in Nyimba and Mkushi consistently showed 57 percent of the children 
24 to 59 months were Vitamin A deficient4.  
 
Causes of poor nutritional status in Zambia  
 
The  causes of malnutrition  are multifaceted and affect all the sectors of the economy as 
explained  in  the  UNICEF  conceptual  frame  work.  The  framework  shows  that  causes  of 
malnutrition  are  grouped  in  immediate,  underlying  and  basic  causes.  The  immediate 
causes  include  inadequate  dietary  intake  and  disease,  the  underlying  include  household

food  insecurity,  inadequate  care  for  women  and  children,  unhealthy  household 
environments and lack of health services. The root causes mainly apply to political issues, 
infrastructures and social and political norms and traditions that the populations adhere to.  
 
The  Zambian diet  has  an over-reliance on maize which is  not  only insufficient  to  fulfill 
energy  needs  and  diversity  but  also  not  able  to  meet  adequate  quantity  and  quality  of 
protein and micronutrient. A study by NFNC5showed that rural areas could only consume 
4 out of the 13 food groups depicting poor diet diversity. In addition, the Zambian diet is 
mainly  vegetarian.  Study  results  show  that  27  percent  to  65  percent  of  the  population 
cannot  afford  a  minimum  cost  of  a  nutritionally  adequate  diet.  Further,  the  increased 
disease burden in the community affects the consumption and causes the loss of essential 
micronutrient in the body contributing to under nutrition.  
 
Current interventions to address under nutrition 
 
The  Zambian  government  has  prioritized  addressing  malnutrition  through  its  food  and 
nutrition policy of 2006 and the subsequent policy implementation plan and the food and 
nutrition  strategic  plan  of  2011  to  2015.  The  NFNC  in  collaboration  with  partners 
developed a three year multi-sectoral programme, focused on the First 1000 Most Critical 
Days Program (MCDP), for all funding and implementing partners. Some of the strategies 
in  this  document  include  reduction  of  stunting  among  children  under  the  age  of  three 
years through the 1000 MCDP. The programme contains a package of interventions that 
has scientific proof of reducing malnutrition in other countries. Therefore, partners have 
come together to mobilize resources for the implementation of these interventions across 
all the key sectors dealing with food and nutrition6.   
 
 
3.5. Water and Sanitation 
 
At  the  beginning  of  the  21st  century,  almost  two  billion  people  –  a  third of  the  world’s 
population  –  were  affected  by  natural  disasters,  and  86  percent  of  these  disasters  were 
floods  and  droughts.  Those  affected  by  emergencies  often  suffer  from  malnutrition, 
injuries, stress and other ailments. Having inadequate water and/or sanitation can lead to 
increased  instances  of  diseases  and  death,  and  a  lack  of  hygiene  can  contribute  to 
diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid,  cholera, measles, scurvy, and other hygiene-related disease 
outbreaks  in  emergencies  –  all  preventable  with  the  right  resources  and  awareness.  In 
addition,  lack  of  WASH  facilities  can  prevent  learners  from  attending  school,  impose  a 
burden  on  women  and  children,  and  diminish  productivity.  For  this  reason,  water, 
sanitation  and  hygiene  are  often  among  the  most  important  elements  not  only  in 
humanitarian disasters but also in development implementation. 

Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) are key components in all aspects of sustainable 
development.  The  country’s  vision  for  water  as  reflected  in  the  Revised  Sixth  National 
Development Plan (R-SNDP, 2013-2016) is to ensure that all Zambians access safe water 
and sanitation as well as efficient and sustainable water utilization for wealth creation and 
betterment  of  livelihoods  by  2030.  Access  to  WASH  is  a  key  public  health  and 
socioeconomic  issue,  especially  in  many  rural  districts  and  peri-urban  areas  in  the

country. The Revised Sixth National Development Plan has identified WASH as an area 
with great potential to improve health, life-expectancy, student learning, gender equality, 
and many other key issues of development. Access to safe water, adequate sanitation, and 
proper  hygiene  education  can  reduce  illness  and  death,  and  also  enhance  poverty 
reduction and socioeconomic development.   

 

The Current Situation and Challenges 

Currently, the water resources development and management is implemented through the 
Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water Development based on the National Water Policy 
of 2010 and the Water Resources Management Act of 2010. Water supply and sanitation 
provision  is  implemented  by  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and  Housing  (MLGH) 
through  commercial  utilities  in  the  urban  and  peri-urban  areas  and  through  the  Local 
Authorities in rural areas guided by the national  water policy and the Water Supply and 
Sanitation  Act  No.  28  of  1997.  The  sector  has  prioritized  infrastructure  development  in 
rural areas in order to improve the livelihood of the rural population where the majority of 
the  poor  live.  The  sector  is  also  developing  the  National  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation 
Policy  that  will  facilitate  effective  development  and  management  of  the  water  supply, 
sanitation and solid waste subsector in Zambia. The Water Supply and Sanitation Act No. 
28 of 1997 will also be reviewed.  
 
The  2013-2014  ZDHS  states  that  the  Percentage  of  population  using  an  improved 
drinking  water  source  at  national  level  is  at  89.2  percent  for  rural  is  46.9  percent  and 
urban is 63.1 percent. The Percentage of population with access to improved sanitation at 
national level is at 39.2 percent for rural is 19.7 percent and urban is 27.3 percent. Though 
there have been improvement in the WASH coverage. it has not been sufficient progress 
to meet the MDGs by 2015. The current deficiencies in WASH services provision result 
from inadequate investment in the water sector; limited institutional and human capacity; 
and  natural  hazards  such  as  flood  and  prolonged  dry  spells  (or  drought)  which  occur 
yearly either combined or individually with varying severity. The sector is also faced with 
the  challenge  of  climate  change  and  variability  resulting  in  increased  atmospheric 
temperature  and  difficulty  in  predicting  rainfall  and  related  events  such  as  flood  and 
drought. For instance, during the 2013/2014 rainy season, flood was the prominent hazard 
affecting  33  districts  while  in  the  2014/2015  rainy  season,  prolonged  dry  spell  was  the 
main hazard affecting 48 districts. 

 

The WASH solutions 

From  2013  to  2016,  the  sector  is  progressively  implementing  WASH  infrastructural 
development  and  management  programmes  outlined  in  the  Revised  SNDP  and  the 
Integrated  Water  Resources  Management  and  Water  Efficiency 
(IWRM/WE) 
Implementation Plan (2007 to 2030) in order to realise the 2030 vision of clean and safe 
water  supply  and  sanitation  for  all  (target  100  percent  for  water  and  90  percent  for 
sanitation). Thus the various infrastructural and management projects and programmes in 
the  water  sector  embarked  on  by  GRZ  and  stakeholders  are  inherently  targeted  at 
addressing  the  above    mentioned  challenges  and  others  including  inadequate  water 
31 

 

 

supplies  to  meet  various  needs,  pollution,  inadequate  information  for  decision  making, 
inefficient use of the water resource and limited stakeholder awareness and participation.  

 
In order to achieve the set targets both in water resources development and management 
and  in  water  supply  and  sanitation,  the  government  through  the  revised  SNDP  has 
projected  investment  in  Water  and  Sanitation  Infrastructure  development  for  the  period 
2013 to 2016 as shown in the table below:

CHAPTER FOUR:  FINDINGS 

 

4.1 General Demographics 

This  section  covers  aspects  relating  to  gender  status,  age  and  marital  status  of  the 
household  heads.  Further  this  section  brings  out  relating  to  education  level  and 
employment status. Household size and dependence ratio are also discussed. 

The 2015  In-depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment was mainly rural based with 92 
percent of the households residing there. The assessment has also shown that the majority 
of  those  assessed  are  male  headed  households  (74  percent)  while  the  rest  were  female 
headed.  The  age  of  the  majority  (30  percent)  of  the  household  heads  assessed  ranged 
between 29 - 39  years age bracket followed by those in the range of 40  - 50 page at 22 
percent  and  those  in  the  range  of  51  -  61  were  15  percent.  The  households  headed  by 
elderly people of 61 years and above made up 16 percent of the assessed households. The 
assessment found that child headed households were insignificant (0.3 percent).  

In  terms  of  marital  status,  the  majority  (78  percent)  of  the  household  heads  in  the 
surveyed districts were married, 11 percent widowed, 5 percent single while the rest were 
either divorced or separated.  

On Educational level of the household head, the majority of the heads (53 percent) in the 
assessed areas had at least primary education.  Furthermore, 25 percent of the household 
heads  indicated  having  reached  up  to  secondary  with  only  5  percent  indicating  they 
attained tertiary.  The rest  of the household  heads indicated  not  have been to  any  formal 
education.  

The  assessment  indicated  that  the  majority  (32  percent)  of  the  households  had  5-6 
household  members  followed  by  30  percent  indicated  having  3-4  household  members. 
Further,  19  percent  of  households  indicating  7  -  8  household  members.  Household  size 
ranges of 1-2 and 9-10 accounted for 8 percent. Only 4 percent indicated household size 
of over 10 household members. The survey further indicated that most of the households 
are keeping orphans with the majority being single orphans (27 percent). Double orphans 
only accounted for 1 percent.  

Most  of  the  household  interviewed  were  informally  employed  (50  percent)  followed  by 
those  who  were    unemployed  (38  percent).  The  rest  were  formally  employed.  The 
employment status given indicates that most of these households were involved in some 
form of income generating activity which is a good indicator for withstanding shocks. 

 
In terms of household head having chronic illness and disability, the percentages were not 
significant (2.5 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively).

4.2. Vulnerability and Hazards 

 

The 2014/ 2015 In-depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment indicated that most of the 
households  in  the  rural  areas  were  affected  by  prolonged  dry  spells  coupled  with  poor 
rainfall distribution in different parts of the country. The hazard that affected these rural 
households  differed  from  district  to  district  and  household  to  household.  The  survey 
revealed      that  87.6  percent  of  the  communities  interviewed  indicated  that  they  were 
severely affected by the prolonged dry spells while 11.4 percent were moderately affected 
by the same hazard. The Survey further shows that the districts that were highly impacted 
included  Sesheke,  Kaoma,  Kalabo,  Gwembe,  Katete  and  Chadiza  while  the  rest      were 
moderately  affected.  In  terms  of  the  mitigation  measures  that  were  put  in  place  to 
minimize the impact of the dry spells, the majority (18. 5 percent) of the households did 
nothing, 14.5 percent engaged in trading, 10. 6 percent were engaged in piece work, while 
9.8 percent diversified their crops and the rest employed other mitigation measures.  

 

4.3. Early Warning 

 

The  assessment  established  that  46  percent  of  the  households  in  the  assessed  districts 
were  warned  about  the  impending  prolonged  dry  spell.  This  was  an  improvement 
compared to previous assessments that have been done. The assessment also established 
that  23  percent  of  the  household  received  these  messages  through  radio.  Other  modes 
used  included  flyers  (15  percent)  and  television  (8  percent)  .The  main  source  of 
information  was  Zambia  Meteorological  Department  (30  percent),  the  District  Disaster 
Management Committees (17 percent) and ZESCO (13percent).  

4.4. Livelihoods 
The  main  livelihoods  for  most  people  in  the  assessed  districts  has  remained  farming, 
trading,  agriculture  wage  labour,  skilled  trade,  non-agricultural  wage  labour  and 
remiattances.  A  few  households  had  pension  and  money  lending  of  of  their  main 
livelihood activities.  

A comparative analysis  between 2014 and 2015 has shown that there is a slight reduction  

Figure 4 : Livelihood Sources by Gender 

 

34 

 

in the proportion of households whose livelihood sources are farming (from 58.5 percent 
to  55.8  percent),  agriculture  wage  labour  (8.9  percent  to  8.8  percent)  and  formal 
employment (from 6.1 percent to 5.7 percent) .  

 

The reduction in the first two livelihood sources can be attributed to the negative impact 
the prolonged dry spells had on agriculture in general. Slight improvements were equally 
observed  in  Non-agriculture  wage  labour,  skilled  artisan,  brewing  and  irregular  daily 
employee. 

Figure 5: Alternative Livelihood Sources 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

This  increase  was  also  attributed  to  affected  households  having  increased  the  focus  of 
their  well-being  on  alternative  livelihood  sources  mentioned  above.Further,  analysis  on 
the main livelihoods across the gender status of the household heads showed that majority 
of  the  female  headed  households  depended  on  money  lending  (58.6  percent),  brewing 
(52.2 percent), remittance (52 percent), agriculture wage labour and formal employment 
(50.3  percent)  as  the  main  livelihood  sources.  On  the  contrary,  the  the  male  headed 
households depended more on artisan/skilled trade (52.6 percent), pension (52.1 percent), 
irregular  daily  employee  (50.9  percent),  non-agriculture  wage  labour  (50.8  percent)  and 
farming (50.8 percent).(Figure 5)   

The assessment findings showed that family size did play a role on the diversity of main 
livelihood  sources  households  had,  a  phenomenon  which  is  consistent  with  previous 
vulnerability  needs  assessments  and  the  2010  Living  Conditions  Monitoring  Survey.  In 
view  of  this,  households  that  had  family  size  of  1  to  2  persons  depended  more  on 
livelihood  sources  which  were  not  that  sustainable  such  as  remittances  (8.9  percent), 
pension (5.6 percent) and irregular daily employee (3.3 percent). Consequently those that 
had family size of 2 to 3 equally depended on similar livelihood sources but also included 
brewing  (25.9  percent),  agriculture  wage  labour  (24.3  percent)  and  pension  (21.4 
percent). It is worth noting that the majority of households with smaller family sizes that 

 

35 

 

depended on these unviable livelihood sources were female headed and had family sizes 
of  1  to  2  and  3  to  4  persons,  which  accounted  for  51.1  percent  and  50.6  percent  that 
respectively. 

Detailed  discussion  of  the  results  of  the  livelihood  components  (asset  ownership, 
expenditure share, coping strategies and food consumption) has been provided below: 

Asset Ownership  

Asset ownership does form part of the the wealth determinants in any given context. This 
is  key  in  understanding  the  general  welfare  of  households.  The  prolonged  dry  spells  of 
2014-2015 rainfall season did affect the utilization of the broader range of assets such as 
Natural  –  Water  Resources,  Grazingland  and  Fish,  Physical  -  farm  equipment,  tools, 
sewing machines, vehicles, livestock, houses, Human - labor power availability within a 
household,  education  and  to  some  extent  skills,  Financial  -wages,  access  to  credit  and 
savingsandSocial 
-, 
neighborhood  associations  and 
networks.  It  is  worth  noting  that 
for 
impact 
assessment report, the analysis on 
assets  focused  only  on  physical 
assets  excluding  livestock  and 
housing.

: Asset Wealth Index: 2014 and 2015 

the 
Majority  (54  percent)  of 
households  assessed  were  Asset 
Medium, 42 percent were Asset 

The mean number of assets owned by a household in the forty eight (48) districts assessed 
was five (5) and this number remained consistence for 2014 and 2015 respectively. The 
analysis  results  showed  marked  variances  in  the  number  of  assets  owned  across  gender 
status,  education  level  and  marital  status  of  the  head  of  households.  In  this  regard,  the 
results showed that the mean number of assets owned by male headed households was six 
(6)  compared  to  4  for  the  female  headed  households.  Further,  from  the  education  level 
perspective  for  the  head  of  household,  the  results  showed  those  that  attained  high 
education level had more assets owned comapred to those that had never been to school 
(4) or only attained primary school level (5 ). For the ones that attained either secondary 
and  tertiary  education  level,  the  mean  number  of  assets  they  owned  was  6.  Suffice  to 
mention despite the small differences in the mean numbers of assets across the education 
level strata, they were statistically signifincant (P<0.05).

Figure 7: Asset Wealth Categorization by Gender 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Consequently,  the  results  also  showed  that  married  head  of  households  possessed  more 
assets (6 ) compared to those who were single, separated, divorced and widowed that had 
a mean number of 4 assets owned. 

Generally, the results have remained consistent in terms of imbalance between male and 
female headed households when it comes to wealth distribution. In this regard, the results 
showed  that  majority  of  the  asset  poor  households  were  femaled  headed  (63.7  percent) 
while  those  who  were  moderately  (61.0  percent)  and  higly  (4.4  percent)  wealthier  were 
male  headed  (see  figure  7).  Within  the  asset  wealth  categories,  the  assessment  results 
showed  a  lot  variances  across  household  head’s  marital  status,  where  the  majority  of 
those who were asset poor were divorced (72.0 percent), widowed (65.4 percent), single 
(62.6  percent)  and  separated  (60.9  percent)  respectively.  As  expected,  majority  of  the 
households who were either moderately or asset rich came from married household heads 
(60.3  percent).  There  were  however  some  household  heads  who  despite  the  larger 
proportion  being  asset  poor  from  the  assessed  districts,  some  were  moderately  or  asset 
rich.  These  accounted  for  38  percent  of  the  household  heads  who  were  separated,  36.7 
percent single, 32.9 percent widowed and 27.6 percent divorced.

Figure 8 : Asset Wealth Categorization by Employment Status 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Further, analysis showed that wealth distribution across different types of employment the 
household  heads  engaged  in  favoured  more  of  the  maled  headed  unlike  the  female 
headed.  Figure  8  showed  that  majority  of  the  asset  poor  household  heads,  whose 
employment  status  was  unemployed  and  informally  employed  ,  were  female  headed 
accounting  for  48  percent  and  33.2  percent  respectively.  Consequently,  the  results  also 
showed  that  female  headed  households  that  fell  under  asset  medium  and  asset  rich 
category were unemployed and informally employed (farmers). In view of the 2014-2015 
prolonged dry spells that affected most of the parts of the country, an attempt was made 
to ascertain to what extent assessed households had their assets affected in one way or the 
other.  In  this  regard,  the  results  showed  that  generally  no  change  in  numbers  of  assets 
owned was observed with a few notable exceptions on hoes, cellphones, axes and radios. 
The  main  reason  for  the  changes  in  the  numbers  of  hoes,  cellphones,  axes  and  radios 
owned  by  some  households  in  the  assessed  districts  were  either  additional  purchases 
made,  assets  damaged  or  sold.  These  casual  factors  that  led  to  the  change  in  number  of 
assets owned despite being minimal,could not have been triggered by negative impacts of 
prolonged  dry  spells.  Generally,  the  results  of  the  assessment  showed  that    asset 
ownership at household level did not change. 

4.5. Agriculture and Food Security 
The  analysis  of  agriculture  and  food  security  in  this  report  is  in  line  with  the  FAO 
definition, utilizing the pillars to interrogate the issue of agriculture and food security in 
the country. The discussion in this chapter focuses on agricultural production issues, food 
availability, access and stability. 
 
4.5.1. Land Availability and Cultivation 
 
The  average  land  holding  of  the  households  in  the  assessed  districts  stood  at  5.04 
hectares. When asked how much of it was owned by the household itself, the assessment 
results  showed  that  an  average  of  4.56  hectares  was  actually  self  –  owned.  Districts  in 

38 

 

 

Southern  and  Central  provinces  had  the  largest  landholding  amongst  the  assessed  areas 
with Choma and Kalomo having 14.5 and 13.1 hectares respectively while the average for 
Kapiri  Mposhi  was  8  hectares.  Households  in  districts  in  Western  province  showed  the 
smallest landholdings with Sikongo reporting an average landholding size of 1.3 hectares. 
 
An  interrogation  of  landholding  by  gender  showed  that  male  headed  households  owned 
2hectares more than the  females. The average land holding for male headed households 
stood at 4.4 hectares while that for females was at 2.4 hectares.  
 
The assessment also showed that an average of 1.8 hectares of arable land was cultivated 
by  the  households  in  the  assessed  districts.  Further,  results  showed  that  majority  of 
households are not utilizing their arable land fully. 
 
4.5.2. Food Availability 
 
Results from the assessment showed that production of the 2014/2015 season stood at 1.3 
million  MT.  The  assessment  showed  that  the  households  in  the  assessed  districts 
anticipate selling about 595, 989 MT of maize. It was also determined that the amount to 
be  given  away  stood  at  597  MT.  The  total  balance  of  the  cereal  likely  to  be  held  at  the 
household level therefore stood at 695, 500 MT.  
 
The other crops grown in the assessed districts included cotton, tobacco, sun flower, soya 
beans, sorghum,  millet,  sweet  potatoes, rice,  groundnuts and cassava. The cash crops of 
cotton,  tobacco  and  sun  flower  were  mainly  grown  in  eastern,  southern  and  central 
provinces.  
 
4.5.3. Food Access 
 
Food  access  at  the  household  level  is  attained  through  a  combination  of  their  own 
production, fishing or gathering wild foods; exchange or purchases from the market and 
gifts  obtained  from  the  household’s  social  networks.  Food  purchases  depend  on  prices 
and  cash  income  and  are  closely  linked  to  livelihood  strategies.  Therefore,  this  section 
discusses access in terms of physical availability, financial, social access as well as how 
markets impact food access. 
 
4.5.4. Access to Own Production 
 
The  results  of  the  assessment  showed  that  production  of  maize  in  most  of  the  districts 
reduced by as much as 38 percent. The western province districts were the most affected 
indicating  a  loss  of  as  much  as  41  percent  overall.  In  terms  of  carry  –  over  stock,  only 
34.7  percent  of  households  reported  to  have  had  stock  from  the  previous  season.  When 
households were asked when cereal would run out, about 55.2 percent indicated that they 
would  have  no  cereal  by  July.  By  the  time  the  households  start  the  lean  period  around 
November, 86.7 percent of the households would have run out of cereal.  
 
Physical Access 
 
Results  from  the  community  focus  group  discussions  showed  that  communities  in  the 
assessed districts would be impeded physical access to the staple mainly because of bad 
roads. This  further weakens household  resilience in  the sense that  such households  may 
not be connected to main markets where the price of the commodity they are selling may 
be better than their local community. 

39 

 

 

 
 
Financial Access 
 
When households were asked whether they would purchase cereal/Millie meal during the 
2015/2016  marketing  season,  only  25.9  percent  indicated  that  they  would  not  purchase 
these  commodities.  From  the  community  focused  groups,  it  was  indicated  that  the 
commodity is currently readily available in the market.  

The survey showed that maize prices at community markets on average were 19.7 percent 
higher than in May 2014. The communities indicated that the main reason for the rise in 
prices was increase in demand coupled with reduced supplies to markets.  

The survey further showed that about 30 percent of households earned cereal from casual 
labour  while  about  45  percent  purchased  maize/maize  meal  between  January  and  May 
2015. This signifies that casual labour continues to be an important source of cereal. 

 

4.5.5. Livestock Condition and Major Crops Grown 

 
The study revealed that 70 percent of the households interviewed owned different species 
of livestock. Majority of households in the assessed district owned chickens. In terms of 
numbers  of  livestock  owned,  the  largest  type  of  livestock  in  the  assessed  districts  was 
chicken  (58  percent),  followed  by  pigs  (14  percent).  Others  owned  were  goats  (11 
percent), cattle (9 percent) and sheep (8 percent), see figure 9 below. 

Figure 9: Type of Livestock Kept by Households

58%11%8%14%9%ChickenGoatSheepPigCattle 

Results of the assessment showed that in terms of livestock prices, there was no change 
between November 2014 and the time of Assessment.     
 

Results  of  the  In  –  depth  Vulnerability  and  Needs  Assessment  showed  that  93  percent 
indicated having grown some crops during the 2014/15 agricultural season. Of these, 86.3 
percent  indicated  having  grown  maize  while  only  about  6  percent  of  the  households 
indicated  having  grown  other  cereal  such  as  rice,  sorghum  and  millet.  When  asked 
whether  households  in  the  assessed  districts  grew  cassava,  only  18  percent  of  the 
households responded in the affirmative. 

In  terms  of  cash  crops,  majority  of  the  households  indicated  having  grown  sunflower 
(19.8  percent)  while  a  few  households  in  the  assessed  districts  indicated  having  grown 
tobacco (11.9 percent) and cotton (10.9 percent). 

 
4.6. Expenditure Share 
 
Expenditure  share  is  key  in  determining  the  economic  vulnerability  of  households  and 
population  in  general.  Under  this  section,  the  discussion  will  be  limited  to  expenditure 
share on food to ascertain to what extent people in the assessed districts created a balance 
between  food  and  non-food  items  in  view  of  the  negative  impacts  brought  about  by  the 
2014-2015 dry spells. The expenditure share analysis in this Impact Assessment Report is 
based  on  both  purchases  and  own  production  estimates  with  a  standard  recall  period  of 
thirty (30) days. 
 

Figure 10: Expenditure Share 

                        
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The assessment results showed that there were variances in food expenditure share across 
the  districts  covered  under  the  2015    Assessment.  In  this  regard,  majority  of  the 
households  spent  more  money  on  food  at  expense  of  the  non  food.The  results  have 

41 

 

 

showed that 34.8 percent of the households had an expenditure share on food between 51 
and 75 percent. Furthermore, a total of 34.1 percent of households had expenditure share 
on food more that 75   percent. 
 

      Figure 11 : Expenditure Share by Gender 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

As  expected,  asset  ownership  did  to  some  extent  determine  how  much  of  expenditure 
balancing  households  had  between  food  and  non-food  items.  In  this  regard,  the 
assessment  results  showed  that  households  that  had  an  expenditure  share  on  food  of  51 
to75  percent  were  mainly  asset  poor  (34.9  percent),  followed  by  asset  medium  (34.6 
percent) and asset rich (35.9 percent). Coincidentally, the results also showed that most of 
female  headed  households  had  a  higher  food  expenditure  share  compared  to  the  male 
headed across all three asset wealth categories. Suffice to mention that the proportion of 
households that had a food expenditure share of  between 51 to 75 percent  was not  only 
from the female headed households but also fell under the asset wealth category “Rich”. 
Similar  trend  was  also  observed  for  the  asset  categories  “Medium”  and  “Poor”  where 
female  headed  households  had  higher  food  expenditure  share  of  upto  75  percent  (see 
figure 11).  
 

Further,  the  results  showed  that  majority  of  households  that  had  food  expenditure  share 
between  51  and  75  percent  had  their  main  livelihood  sources  as  Money  lending  (56.9 
percent),  skilled  trade/artisan  (41.0  percent),  trading  (38.3  percent),  irregular  daily 
employee (38.2 percent), agriculture wage labour (37 percent) and non- agriculture wage 
labour.  Generally,  all  the  households  that  depended  on  farming  (crop  and  livestock)  as 
their main livelihood had fewer proportion of households that had high expenditure share 
on food. 

 

 

42 

 

4.7. Food Consumption Scores (FCS) 
 
The  Food  Consumption  Score  is  a  composite  score  based  on  dietary  diversity,  food 
frequency  and  relative  nutrition  importance  of  different  food  groups  consumed  by 
individuals,  households  and  people  in  general.  The  discussion  under  this  section  of  the 
2015  Assessment  Report  will  tease  out  to  what  extent  the  prolonged  dry  spells  affected 
consumption patterns of households and people in the assessed districts. 
 
The Assessment showed that most of the people in the assessed districts have acceptable 
food  consumption  scores  (52.7  percent)  followed  by  those  with  borderline  food 
consumption  scores  (24.6  percent).  Although  the  survey  showed  that  majority  of  the 
households had good dietary diversity in the form of consumption scores, there were still 
22.7 percent of households which had poor dietary diversity. 
 
In terms of the gender perspective, the findings showed that majority of those that had a 
poor consumption score were actually male (14.4 percent) compared to only 8.2 percent 
of their female counterparts (see figure 12 ). 
 
Figure 12: Food Consumption Score by Gender 

 

 
When  education  levels  is  crossed  with  the  food  consumption  score,  the  assessment 
indicated  that  the  highest  proportion  of  the  households  with  poor  food  consumption 
scores had household heads that had either never been to school (7.2 percent) or had only 
attained  primary  education  (11.9  percent).  Those  households  that  had  heads  with  an 
education level of secondary or higher had high consumption scores. 
 
In  terms  of  marital  status,  evidence  gathered  showed  that  of  those  that  had  poor 
consumption  scores,  the  divorced  or  widowed  had  more  people  in  this  category  (see 
figure  12).  In  terms  of  age  of  head  of  household,  11.9  percent  of  the  child  headed 
households  had  poor  consumption  scores.  Those  in  the  18  –  28  years  age  bracket  had 
about  5.1 percent  of people who had poor scores. When analysed from  the employment 
perspective, majority of those that had poor consumption scores were actually in informal 
employment (21.4 percent).

Figure 13: Food Consumption Score by Marital Status 

 
There is certainly a correlation between asset ownership with diversity of food consumed 
which to a larger extent is determined by the viability of the income sources. Majority of 
those that had poor consumption scores were either asset poor or asset medium (see figure 
14). 
 
Figure 14: Food Consumption Score by Asset Wealth 

 

 

 
 
 
 
4.8. Coping Strategy Index (CSI) 
 
Coping  strategies  are  things  that  households  and  people  in  general  do  to  try  to  increase 
their food and  cash income after a shock or hazard.  In this section,  the coping strategy 
index has been used to determine those households that were already using a high number 
of  coping  strategies  to  access  food.  Thus,  a  high  CSI  score  generally  means  that  a 
household  is  unable  to  access  enough  food,  and  therefore  has  to  rely  on  a  number  of 
coping  strategies;  conversely,  the  lower  the  CSI  score,  the  fewer  the  coping  strategies 
harnessed (Maxwell & Caldwell, 2008:2) leading to the assumption that the household is 
more food secure. 
 

44 

 

 

The fact that the majority of households (58.8 percent) had a CSI below the mean (23.4) 
implies  that  about  half  of  households  were  better  equipped  regarding  the  use  of  coping 
strategies  relative  to  the  average  of  the  assessed  districts.  Furthermore,  a  standard 
deviation  of  9  is  indicative  of  the  limited  range  of  coping  strategies  employed  by 
households.  
 
The  households  with  5  –  6  members  had  the  highest  mean  CSI,  with  a  value  of  24.3, 
followed  by  the  households  with  3  –  4  members  and  the  smaller  households  with  1  -2 
members,  with  a  mean  CSI  of  18.  The  higher  number  of  coping  strategies  used  by 
households  with  9  –  10  members  might  have  arisen  from  the  fact  that  there  were  more 
children  per  household  who  required  adequate  and  nutritious  food  for  their  continued 
growth. When these households anticipated problems relating to food consumption, they 
tended to use more coping strategies in an effort to avoid these anticipated problems.

The  Spearman’s  correlation  coefficient  between  the  number  of  household  members  and 
CSI  showed  a  strong  negative  monotonic  relationship  (r  =  -  0.72  at  p  <  0,001).  This 
strong  negative  correlation  coefficient  indicates  that  when  the  number  of  household 
members  increased,  the  coping  strategies  used  by  the  households  generally  decreased, 
hence  a  reduction  in  the  food  insecurity  with  the  increase  in  the  number  of  people  in  a 
household. The fact that households with large household members had a fairly low CSI 
may  be  attributed  to  larger  labour  force  available  for  the  household  and  hence  greater 
food security.

In  terms  of  employment  status  of  the  household  head,  the  assessment  revealed  that 
households with heads in formal or in informal employment had a lower CSI of 23.6 and 
23.8  respectively  while  those  households  with  unemployed  heads  had  a  CSI  of  25.6.  It 
has also been found through research that households with more employed members are 
better  able  to  purchase  adequate  food  supplies;  employment  plays  an  important  role  in 
food security and in decreasing the need to change behaviours to access food (Food and 
Agriculture Organization, 2012:10).

The above table shows that those that had never been to school were more food insecure 
than  those  that  had  some  schooling  (primary  to  tertiary).  However,  the  Standard 
Deviation  showed  that  the  number  of  coping  methods  were  inversely  proportional  to 
schooling. The gender of the household head showed that male headed households (23.6) 
were more food secure than those that were female headed (24.5). The methods of coping 
employed by these two types of households were insensitive to gender of headship. 
 

4.9. Health 

Diseases that affected assessed Households 

In the first quarter of the year under review 72.3 percent of households from rural areas 
reported  to  have  fallen  sick  which  was  higher  than  65.1  percent  reported  from  urban 
households.  However,  a  minimal  deference  was  observed  between  urban  and  rural 
households among those who were sick two weeks prior to the assessment. (53.7 percent 
rural  households  and  55.9  percent  urban).    The  survey  also  showed  that  among 
households  members  who  fell  sick  malaria  had  a  higher  percentage  than  any  other 
disease. Figure () shows the diseases suffered during the first quarter. 56.1percent of the 
respondents reported to have contracted Malaria, 3.4 percent diarrhoea, 5.1 percent cough 
and 5.3 percent other diseases. Two (2) weeks prior to the assessment only 26 percent of 
the  respondents  reported  to  have  contracted  malaria  and  higher  percentages  were  those 
from  rural  areas.  The  most  affected  districts  were  Nyeyema  100  percent,  Luampa  65.5 
percent, Kaoma 53.4 percent, Ngabwe 47.1 percent, Mpika 47 percent, Mwinilunga 44.2 percent, 
Chama 44 percent  and Masaiti 43 percent.

Health Care Seeking Behaviour 

The  survey  indicates  that  health  care  seeking  behaviour  depend  on  the  disease  the 
household  member  is  suffering  from.  Figure  17  shows  that  80.3  percent  of  the 
respondents  who  contracted  fever/malaria  opted  for  formal  care  services  while  66.2 
percent  opted  not  to  seek  any  medication  and  64.2  percent  preferred  their  own 
medication. 53.3 percent opted to visit the pharmacy/dispensary. On the other hand about 
27 percent of household members who had diarrhea opted to visit traditional healers and 
about 29 percent went for other alternatives. 38.1 percent of those who had a cough opted 
for  private  formal  health  care  while  18.5  percent  opted  for  pharmacy/dispensary  with  a 
few going for traditional healers or not seeking any medication. 

Figure 16: Health Care Seeking Behaviour by Disease 

 

 

According to the above there is still some resistance in some sector of society to change 
their health care behavior. There are various reasons, however, as to why some household 
members opt not to seek formal health care. The major reason being lack of transport as 
indicated in figure 17.  Transport accounts for 38 percent, money 24 percent, home based 
care 14 percent and 24percent too ill to go to a health facility.

Disease suffered by main water source 

The  assumption  is  that  if  households  use  improved  water  sources  the  disease  burden 
would be less. However, the survey shows otherwise in that the results show that most of 
the disease incidences were reported by household that used improved water sources. For 
instance  Figure  18  indicates  that  57.3percent  households  using  improved  water  sources 
reported that they had Fever/Malaria while the households that used unimproved sources 
had  47.2  percent.  Households  that  reported  having  contracted  diarrhoea  who  used 
improved  water  sources  were  67percent  and  those  that  used  unimproved  water  sources 
were  33  percent.  Scabies  on  the  other  hand  is  the  only  disease  that  reported  a  higher 
percentage of 73.8 for the households that use unimproved water source. The reasons for 
the  difference  in  disease  incidences  by  water  source  could  be  due  to  the  fact  that  the 
assessment  was  based  on  the  type  of  water  source  rather  than  the  quality  of  water  at 
source. In addition, the households that were assessed used more improved water sources 
than unimproved. 

 

            Figure 18: Diseases by Water Source 

 

 

The  analysis  results  show  that  72.2  percent  of  the  households  that  accessed  water  from 
the  river  or  lake  reported  to  have  contracted  Fever/  Malaria  while  72.4  percent  that 
accessed water from protected wells reported to have contracted Malaria. 11.1 percent of 
the members that accessed water from the borehole and 11.1 percent that accessed piped 
water  reported  to  that  they  suffered  from  diarrhea.  Reasons  for  these  observed 
percentages  could  be  that  the  improved  water  source  was  not  checked  for  quality  or 
confirmed safe for drinking.

Disease burden by water treatment 

Treatment  of  water  is  one  of  the  attributes  to  the  waterborne  disease  burden.  The 
assessment  indicates  that  the  percentage  of  households  that  didn’t  treat  water  reported 
higher percentages of incidence in  terms of the  water related diseases. For example, the 
households  that  didn’t  treat  water  reported  sickness  due  to  diarrhoea  (3.6  percent); 
malaria (55.1 percent), cough (5.3 percent) while the households that used water that was 
treated reported sickness due to diarrhoea ( 3.0 percent),0.6 percent lower than those who 
did not treat their water, and malaria (58.5 percent).

Disease by type of Sanitation Facility 

The type of sanitation facility used by the household does to some extent contribute to the 
type  of  diseases  suffered  by  household.  The  assessment  shows  that  most  of  the 
households  that  suffered  from  diarrhea  were  those  using  traditional  pit  latrines  (63.7 
percent) as their main sanitation facility. The disease burden for Households that had no 
sanitation facility was 29.7 percent. 

 

              Table 8: Diseases by Sanitation Facility 

 

 

The  analysis  results  have  further  shown  that  majority  of  the  households  that  had  a 
member sick from diarrhea in the last two weeks prior to the assessment and their main 
sanitary  disposal  was  traditional  latrine  or  no  facility,  reside  in  the  rural  strata  of  the 
surveyed  districts.  On  the  other  hand  only  3.5  percent  of  the  households  that  use 
improved sanitary facilities such as flash toilets reported cases of diarhoea and only 1.1 
percent was reported from those who used VIP toilets.  
 

Disease suffered by distance from water source  

There is moderate proof from the data that distance to water source was a factor to disease 
burden  in  that  the  further  away  the  household  is  from  the  water  source  the  more  prone 
they are to contracting a disease. People staying far from water sources tend to ration their 
use  of  water  to  the  extent  that  some  safe  practices  such  as  washing  hands  after  using 
toilets are perceived to be a waste of water. In some cases even bathing is avoided in an 
effort of preserving water for other perceived important activities.  

Figure 21 shows that households covering a distance between 100 to 500m to fetch water 
has a higher risk of contracting diseases as compared to other households. The data shows 
that  scabies  has  the  lowest  percentage  with  40.1  and  the  highest  being  Cough  with 
49.8.Surprisingly  enough  households  covering  distances  more  than  500m  indicated  a 
lower  risk  of  contracting  most  of  the  diseases  as  compared  to  those  covering  distances 
between 100 – 500m.

Fever, ARI/cough, and  Diarrhea were the top three diseases that affected the under five 
children  during  the  period  under  review.  The  highest  prevalent  was  ARI/cough  with  29 
percent  followed by  Fever and diarrhoea with  27.2 percent  and 10.1percent  respectively 
as shown in figure 22 below.

were  N/Western  (39.3percent),  Western  (33.4percent),  and  Central  (32.6percent).  For 
ARI/  Cough  the  most  affected  provinces  were  Western  (42percent),  Muchinga

Almost  all  the  parents  interviewed  indicated  that  they  had  their  children  immunized  as 
showed  in  the  figure  above.  The  lowest  percentage  was  OPV  4  with  9.3%  because  it  is

4.10. Nutrition 

Meal Consumption Pattern 
 

The assessment of food consumption is essential in understanding the immediate causes 
of  under  nutrition  in  the  population.  Disturbances  in  the  dietary  consumption  within  a 
short period of time have a direct influence on the nutrition status of the population. The 
survey  results  on  consumption  in  30  days  preceding  the  survey  indicate  that  about  32.9 
percent of the households ran out of food, 28 percent slept hungry and 21.4 percent spent 
the whole day without food at any one time in 30 days. 

Frequency of occurrence of the problem 

The results show that majority  (18.4 percent ) of those who had no food  had experienced 
this 1 to 2 times in 30 days and 12.2 percent  experienced this between  3 to 10 times in 
the 30 day preceding the survey. In addition, of the 28.8 percent of the households who 
slept with hunger, 17.6 percent rarely experienced this and 9.5 percent experienced it 3 to 
10  times  in  30  days.  Further,  among  those  who  went  without  food,  13.3  percent 
experienced it rarely and 7  percent  experienced it 3 to  10 times in  30 days.  Less  than 3 
percent of the households frequently experienced this. 

This shows that there was a general disturbance in food intake among the households in 
30 days preceding the survey.

Meal frequency  

The  frequency  of  meal  consumption  at  household  level  is  important  in  assessing  the 
adequacy  of  nutrient  intake  of  the  household  members.    The  assessment  of  meal 
frequency  the  day  preceding  the  survey  in  the  household,  among  adults  and  children 
showed that majority of the households (46.6 percent) had three meals, 43.4 percent had 
two meals, 9.3 percent had one meal and the rest had no meal a day preceding the survey.  
In  addition,  0.2  percent  of  households  slept  hungry  the  day  preceding  the  survey.  It 
therefore evident that the households were not having the usual meals as seen in figure 23 
below. 

Figure 23: Meals consumed Preceding Day and Normal Meals 

 

The  data  showed  that  on  average  0.3  percent  of  households  in  the  entire  district  slept 
hungry, 8.9 percent ate once and 46.3 percent ate two times the day preceding the survey. 
About 2.1 percent of the households in Shangombo, Ikelenge, Sikongo and Sioma had no 
meals a day preceding the survey. Sikongo and Sioma recorded the highest proportion of 
households  (50.7  percent  and  34.6  percent  respectively)  who  had  one  meal  the  day 
preceding  the  survey.  Further,  Lukulu  and  Nyimba  showed  that  over  79  percent  of  the 
households ate two meals the day preceding the survey. 

 The  results  indicated  that  53  percent  of  the  households  reported  that  they  usually  ate  3 
meals per day while 42 percent usually ate twice per day. This implies that those who had 
2  meals  consumed  normally  while  there  was  a  slight  reduction  among  those  who  ate  3 
meals.  Therefore,  there  were  no  major  disturbances  in  their  meal  consumption  pattern 
among the households.  Further, the data showed that over 50 percent of the households 
in Southern province and 2 districts in eastern province had normal meals a day preceding 
the survey.

Nutritional Status 

Child Nutrition  
The survey assessed a total of 452 595children in all the forty-eight (48) districts of which 
51.6 percent were males and 48.4 percent were females.   

Breast feeding  

Continued breast feeding among children 6 to 59 months of age is essential for continued 
growth  and  development  of  the  child.  Breast  milk  contributes  greatly  to  the  nutrient 
requirement  of  the  child  after  6  months  though  it  is  not  sufficient  to  provide  all  the 
nutrients  required  at  this  age.  The  survey  showed  that  about  28.3  percent  of  children 
between 6 to 24 months of age were still breast feeding in all the forty-eight (48) districts. 
Mambwe  districts  showed  the  lowest  proportion (2.3  percent)  of  children  not  breast  fed 
followed  by  Sesheke,  Mwandi,  Serenje,  Samfya  and  Lundazi  which  were  below  10 
percent. On the other hand, Senanga had the highest proportion (40 percent) of children 
breast  feeding followed by Mongu, Zimba, Kaoma and Namwala which  had around 30 
percent of the children. 

Micronutrient Supplementation 

Consistent  vitamin  A  supplementation  among  children  under-five  above  80  percent  has 
the  potential  to  reduce  child  Mortality.  In  addition,  de-worming  programme  plays  a 
critical  role  in  reduction  of  under  nutrition  among  children  and  pregnant  women.  The 
survey showed that  81.5 percent of the children  in  the survey areas  received Vitamin  A 
supplementation and 56.3 percent were de-wormed in the 6 months preceding the survey 
(Table).The data further shows that districts such as Nkeyema, Senanga, Ngabwe, Pemba, 
and  Chikankata  recorded  90  percent  to  100  percent  Vitamin  A  Supplementation,  de-
worming coverage was  100 percent  in  Ngabwe  and  Nkeyema  while Senanga , Sesheke, 
Nalolo Mwinilunga recorded over 90 percent coverage. 

 

Child feeding Programme  

Supplementation  and  therapeutic  feeding  programs  have  been  designed  to  help  in  the 
rehabilitation  of  the  undernourished  children.  Enrollment  of  children  in  three  feeding 
programs in the 3 months preceding the survey    showed that 4.2 percent of children in 
the survey were enrolled in supplementary feeding programs, 3.3 percent were enrolled in 
therapeutic  feeding  and  2.8  percent  were  currently  enrolled  in  the  therapeutic  feeding 
programs.  Analysis  at  district  level  showed  that  5.5  percent  of  children  in  Luampa,  5.6 
percent  in  Mpika,  5.1  percent  in  Mwinilunga  were  enrolled  in  supplementary  feeding. 
Therapeutic  feeding  was  reported  among  39.2  percent  of  the  children  in  Petauke,  26.8 
percentin Nyimba, 15.5 percent in Nyimba and 4.7 percent in Mambwe.

Child feeding programme 

Child feeding at household level is influenced by a number of factors. Family size has a 
significant  impact  on  household  food  distribution  and  subsequent  child  feeding.  The 
results  found  an  association  between  family  size  and  enrollment  to  child  supplementary 
feeding programme (p=0.000).  The results show that most children from the family size 
of    5  to  6  people    were  enrolled  in  supplementary  feeding  3  months  prior  to  the  survey 
and children about 5 percent  of the children from the family size of between 3 to 6 were 
enrolled in therapeutic feeding programs three months prior to the survey (Table …….).

Child Nutritional status  

The MUAC measurement for children is used as a proxy for wasting and assesses the risk 
of death among 6 to 24 months of age. Oedema was also used in the assessment to assess 
the level of severe under nutrition among the children. The results shows that 2.2 percent 
children were at risk of severe wasting, 3.2 percent were at risk of moderate wasting and 
94 percent of the children were not at risk of wasting or death in the entire district.  More 
girls  (2.3 percent) were at risk of sever wasting than boys (2.1 percent) while the same 
proportion of boys and girls were at risk of moderate wasting(3.2 percent) (Figure below). 
The result further shows that Sioma (18.9 percent), Sikongo (15.7 percent) and  Lundazi 
(11.4  percent)  districts  had  highest  proportion  of  children  with  severe  wasting.  The 
moderate wasting was highest in Mwinilunga (10.5 percent) and Sinda (9.5 percent) while 
other districts had less than 7 percent of the children in the moderate range (Annex….). 

 Further, the data shows that 1 percent of the children had Oedema across the districts and 
more boys (1.2 percent) had Oedema than girls (0.7 percent). This is consistent with other 
surveys that have been done in the country though districts specific survey data may not 
be available. 

Figure 25: Child Nutritional Status 

 

Child MUAC and family size  

The  number  of  people  in  the  household  influences  the  consumption  of  the  household 
members  especially  the  children.  The  results  established  a  strong  association  between 
family size and wasting  among children (p=0.000). The results show that 3.2 percent  of 
children  in  households  with  7  to  8  people  were  severely  wasted  and  4.4  percent  were 
moderately wasted. In addition, 3, 4 percent of the children with Oedema were found in 
households with 9 to 10 people.

Child MUAC with Age of Household Head 

The age of the household head influences the nutrition decision at household level hence 
influences  the  extent  to  which  resources  are  used  to  access  to  provide  food  for  the 
household.  The survey assessed associations between wasting and age of the households 
head.    A  strong  association  was  found  between  wasting  based  on  MUAC  and  age  of 
household  head  (p=0.001).  The  results  show  that  10.6  percent  of  moderately  wasted 
children were found in houses with household heads less than 18  years old. In addition, 
about 5.5 percent to 5.1 percent of moderately wasted children were found in households 
with heads aged 51 to 61 years old and above 61 years old respectively.

Child MUAC by Illness in Past two weeks  

A  childhood  illness  is  one  of  the  immediate  causes  of  under  nutrition  according  to  the 
Conceptual framework of under nutrition.  Childhood illness suffered with 2 weeks prior 
to  assessment can influence the wasting levels  among children. The survey  assessed the 
childhood illnesses 2 week prior to the survey. The results indicate that 1.5 percent of the 
children who were severely wasted had a fever, 0.9 percent had a cough and 1.2 percent 
had diarrhea. In addition, among those with moderate wasting, 4.1 percent had a fever and 
a cough and 3.9 percent had diarrhea (Table 13).

Mothers Nutritional Status  
MUAC among adults is used to assess the nutritional status and determine the eligibility 
for  nutrition  support  in  low  resource  setting  and  in  emergencies.  The  MUAC 
measurement  show  that  6.2  percent  of  women  were  severely  undernourished  while  5.9 
percent  were  moderately  malnourished  (Figure  below).  The  results  further  shows  that 
majority  of  the  severely  wasted  women  were  found  in  Sioma  (20  percent)  and  Masaiti 
(19.3  percent)  districts.  Other  districts  such  as  Kapiri,  Katete,  Ikelenge,  Chama  and 
Namwala  had  between  9  percent  and  10  percent  of  the  severely  wasted  women. 
Moderately  under  wasting  was  highest  in  Mwinilunga  (20.9  percent)  and  Petauke  (19 
percent)). Other districts with less than 14 percent of moderately wasted women included 
Sikongo  (13.7  percent),  Chama  (12.0  percent),  Kapiri  Mposhi  (11.8  percent),  Lukulu 
(10.6 percent) and Senanga (12.5 percent). 

Figure 26: Nutrition Status of Women 

 

Women Nutritional status with Household Size  

Women contribute greatly towards the acquisition of food in the households. Family size 
is  key  in  the  intra  household  food  distribution  and  is  especially  important  in 
understanding  the  nutritional  status  of  women  in  the  household.  The  results  show  that 
high  proportion  of  severely  wasted  women  were  found  in  households  with  3  to  10 
members and moderate wasting was common among households with 1 to 6 members of 
the household(Figure).

The  results  imply  that  thought  women  are  the  primary  distributors  of  food  in  the 
household,  they  do  not  consume  enough  and  most  times  they  are  overwhelmed  by 
ensuring everybody has food at the expense of their own nutrition. 

Figure 27: Women Nutritional status by Household size 

 

Women Nutritional Status and Child Wasting 

Women  are  primary  care  providers  for  children  and  their  nutritional  status  plays  a  key 
role in the nutritional status of the children and in the provision of child care. The results 
of the survey shows that 58.4 percent of the severely undernourished women had severely 
wasted  children  and  only  35.3  percent  of  women  with  normal  nutritional  status  had 
severely wasted children. 

This implies that women nutritional status is important if under nutrition among children 
is to be eradicated.  Therefore, women need to be targeted with interventions that reduce 
under nutrition if child nutrition has to be addressed.

Main Water Sources 
The  assessment  revealed  that  the  access  to  total  improved  water  supply  by  main  source 
was 56.2 percent (of which 39.8 percent was borehole, 8.6 percent protected well and 7.8 
percent  piped  water,).  The  access  to  total  unimproved  water  supply  by  main  source  of 
drinking  water  was  43.8  percent  (of  which  26.8  percent  was  unprotected  well,  15.6 
percent  river  or  lake  and  1.4  percent  other  unimproved  source).  For  the  purpose  of  this 
report,  improved  water  sources  were  grouped  as  borehole,  piped  and  protected  wells 
while  unimproved  water  sources  were  grouped  as  unprotected  wells,  streams,  rivers  or 
lakes and other.

Alternative or Secondary Water Sources 
 
The assessment also revealed that the access to total improved water supply by alternative 
or  secondary  sources  of  drinking  water  was  30.9  percent  (of  which  21.9  percent  was 
borehole,  3.3  percent  piped  water  and  5.7  percent  protected  well).    The  access  to  total 
unimproved  water  supply  by  alternative  or  secondary  source  of  drinking  water  was  38 
percent  (of  which  18.7  percent  was  unprotected  well,  16.3  percent  river  or  lake, 
and3percent  other  unimproved  source).The  assessment  further  revealed  that  another31.1 
percent of the households did not have any alternative or secondary water source because 
normally their main sources do not dry. 
 
Figure 30: Secondary Water Sources 

 
 
Main Water Sources by Region 

 

The rural population accounted for 40 percent portion of unimproved water with only 15 
percent  unimproved  water  sources  reporting  for  the  urban  population.  The  rural 
households accounted for 91.8 percent of the responses for main water sources while the 
urban  area  accounted  for  8.2  percent.  In  the  rural  areas,  the  most  common  main  water 
source  was  borehole  (47.6  percent),  followed  by  unprotected  well  (24.0  percent).  In  the 
urban areas, the most  common main water sources were piped water  (59.2 percent)  and 
borehole (15.3 percent).  
 
The  provincial  distribution  of  the  main  water  sources  indicates  that  Luapula,  Muchinga 
and Central had the highest unimproved water sources with 71 percent, 68 percent and 57 
percent, respectively. The provinces with the highest improved main water sources were 
Eastern (82 percent), North-Western (68 percent) and Southern (67 percent).

Sources of Water Affected by Prolonged Dry Spell 

The study revealed that 51.2 percent of the households said their main water sources were 
affected by the prolonged dry spells while 48.8 percent were not affected.  
 
Water Availability at Source 

The  study  revealed  that  of  the  households  that  responded,  21  percent  reported  that  their 
main water sources dried up and 79 percent did not dry up. The most affected main water 
sources  which  were  reported  to  have  dried  up  were  others  (50.4  percent),  unprotected 
wells  (33.4  percent)  and  rivers  or  lakes  (25.1  percent).  “Other”  water  sources  included 
streams, scoop holes and springs. The households reporting water sources that did not dry 
up mostly include piped water (94.1 percent), borehole (84.9 percent) and protected well 
(79.7 percent).

The study also revealed that the water level at the main source compared to the same time 
last year was reported by households  to be lower (44.5 percent), the same (52.3 percent) 
and  higher  (3.2  percent).  The  study  revealed  that  the  main  water  sources  whose  water 
level  dropped  compared  to  the  previous  year  (2014)  were  unprotected  wells  (70.2 
percent)  and  the  river  or  lake  (59.1  percent).  However,  the  main  water  sources  whose 
water  level  remained  the  same  include  piped  water  (78.7  percent),  borehole  (65.1

Treatment of Drinking Water 

Only  24.6percent  of  the  households  treated  their  water  while  the  75.4  percent  of  the 
households did not treat their drinking water in any way. The distribution of the type of 
treatment revealed that 17.3 percent use chlorine (70.3 percent of those households who 
treat  their  water)  was  the  most  widely  used  followed  by  6.7  percent  of  the  households 
who boil their water (27 percent  of those households  who treat  their water).Another 0.4 
percent  treated  their  water  using  other  methods,  with  a  nominal  0.1  percent  each  using 
filtration and decanting for their water treatment.

Hand washing practices before cooking and after using the toilet 
The study revealed that out of the households that responded, 82.8 percent washed their 
hands before preparing food and 17.2 percent did not. After using the toilet, 84 percent of 
households washed their hands and 16 percent did not. 

 

Scouring agents used for hand washing  
Regarding  hand  washing after use of the toilet, 49.2 percent  said  they use soap to  wash 
their hands; 2.7 percent use ash and 31.9 percent only use water to wash their hands (of 
those  who  said  they  washed  their  hands  after  using  the  toilet,  58  percent  used  soap;  3 
percent  used  ash;  and  1  percent  used  other  means  while  38  percent  used  nothing  but 
water).  
 

Sanitation Facilities Distribution by Asset Wealth Index 
The study revealed that the use of soap as a scouring agent in hand washing was highest 
in  each  of  the  three  asset  wealth  indices.  The  table  below  shows  that  among  the  Asset 
Poor the use of soap was reported by 39.3 percent respondents; for the Asset Medium it 
was 56.9 percent; and among the Asset Rich it was 77.0 percent. The use of no scouring 
agent was also significantly high (38.4 percent among the Asset Poor; 28.9 percent for the 
Asset Medium and only 12.3 percent among the Asset Rich).

4.12. Developmental Projects and Safety Net Projects  
 
Development  projects  and  safety  nets  programmes  are  critical  for  reducing  poverty  and 
boosting inclusive  growth and shared prosperity  as well as stimulating local  economies. 
This  in  turn  helps  households  to  better  manage  risks  and  cope  with  shocks  in  district 
where they are done.  
 
The  assessment  found  that  about  96  percent  of  the  districts  indicated  that  there  were 
development projects and safety net programmes in their districts going on at the time of 
the  survey.  These  were  Home  Based  Care  programmes  (24  percent)  which  formed  the 
majority  followed  by  Social  Cash  transfer  (21  percent),  Storage  Shed  (17)  and  General 
Food Distribution (14) as shown in Figure.....

CHAPTER FIVE: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

5.1. Agriculture and Food Security 
 

Conclusion 

  No  major  productive  assets  were  offloaded  and/or  sold  in  response  to  the 

prolonged dry spells. 

  Livelihood  diversity  still  remains  low  with  majority  of  the  households  in  the 
livelihoods  (e.g.  crop 

assessed  districts  dependent  on  agricultural  based 
production, livestock rearing and agriculture wage labour). 

  The permanent and seasonal cash incomes in the assessed districts are also largely 

agricultural based mainly being sale of crops and agricultural wage labour. 

  Employment  of moderate to  high  cost  coping mechanisms was high  across  most 

of the assessed districts (RCSI). 

  Prolonged  dry  spells  did  have  an  impact  on  household  food  production  which 
ultimately  will  affect  household  food  security  especially  as  households  move 
towards the lean period. 

  Despite a slight increase in dietary diversity, the assessment showed that there is 

over – dependency on carbohydrates (mainly maize and sweet potatoes). 

  Need to strengthen the extension delivery system. 
  Utilizing  a  composite  index  of  FCS,  Expenditure  Share  on  food  and  coping 
behaviour, the results of the survey showed that 31 districts in six provinces would 
require assistance. 
 

 

Recommendations 

Short Term 

  A total of 798, 948 people (133, 158 households) from thirty one (31)districts will 
require food relief amounting to 53, 242 MT of maize equivalent for a period of 
eight  (8)  months  (August,2015  –  March,2016).These  include:  Serenje  and 
Chitambo  (Central);  Chadiza,  Chipata,  Katete,  Lundazi,  Mambwe,  Nyimba, 
Petauke,  Sinda,  Vubwi  (Eastern);  Samfya  (Luapula)  Chikankata,  Gwembe, 
Kazungula,  Pemba,  Sinazongwe  (Southern);  Ikelenge  (North  Western)  and 
Kalabo,  Kaoma,  Mulobezi,  Senanga,  Sesheke,  Shangombo,  Nalolo,  Limulunga, 
Nkeyema, Sikongo, Sioma, Mwandi, Luampa (Western).  

  There  is  need  to  monitor  the  evolvement  of  the  food  security  situation  in  the 
seventeen  (17)  districts  as  most  of  them  fall  within  the  moderately  food  secure 
district  with  a  possibility  of  graduating  into  food  insecurity  as  we  approach  the 
lean period. 

  There is need to strengthen the extension delivery system. 
 

Input provision for 45,079 households in twenty-seven districts (27) districts. 
 
 
 
 

70 

 

 

 

Medium to Long Term 

  Livelihood  diversification  programmes  be  scaled  up  in  order  to  contribute  to 

alternative livelihoods. 

  Strengthen the support on conservation farming implementation. 
  There  is  need  to  introduce  appropriate  technologies  for  small  –  scale  farmers 
which could enhance household food security such as water harvesting and small 
scale irrigation systems. 

  There is need to enhance the monitoring of nutrition and food security through the 

establishment of sentinel sites. 

  Child headed Households should be targeted for food security pack programs  
  Promote  asset  building  projects  among  the  child  headed  households  through 

Youth empowerment funds. 

5.2. Health 

 

Conclusion 

Malaria was the most common disease suffered  by household  members  especially those 
in  rural  areas.  The  most  affected  districts  were:  NKeyema  100  percent,  Luampa  65.5 
percent, Kaoma 53.4 percent, Ngabwe 47.1 percent, Mpika 47 percent, Mwinilunga 44.2 
percent,  Chama  44  percent  and  Masaiti  43  percent.  The  percentages  of  infection  for 
diarrhoea,  respiratory  infection  and  other  diseases  were  too  low  as  a  result  they  had  no 
significant consequence on household’s livelihood.   

On  health  care  seeking  behavior,  a  bigger  percentage  of  respondents  who  didn’t  seek 
medication  at  all  and  those  who  took  their  own  medication  where  those  who  suffered 
from malaria. There is need to increase the deployment of Community Health Assistants 
(CHAs) to communities so as to sensitize communities on the importance of making use 
of health facilities.   

Fever  and  ARI/cough  were  the  top  two  diseases  that  affected  the  under  five  children  in 
the  districts  were  the  assessment  took  place.  ARI/cough  had  29  percent  and  fever  had 
27.2 percent.  

Recommendations 

Short term 

 

Increase the coverage of indoor-residual spraying and effective use of RDTs.for the 
following  districts;  Nkeyema,  Luampa,  Kaoma,  Ngabwe,  Mpika,  Mwinilunga, 
Chama,  and Masaiti and  

  There is need to develop a Statutory Instrument on the use of ITNs. 

 

Medium to Long term  

  Extending malaria surveillance to  community level  using an  active case detection 

system for community level surveillance. 

  There is need to improve on the supply of drugs and logistics for treatment of 

respiratory infections (non-pneumonia). 

71 

 

 

 

  Recruit more Community Health Assistants (CHAs). 
  There is need to promote community based disease prevention mechanisms. 

5.3. Nutrition 
Conclusion 

The study showed that most of the households ate two meals a day preceding the survey. 
Most households that ate twice had normal meals and a reduction was seen among those 
that ate three meals compared to their normal meals. This situation could be explained by 
the  fact  that  most  households  reported  having  run  out  of  food  in  30  days  preceding  the 
survey and a reduction was observed among those who normally eat three meals.   

The  results  indicate  that  the  overall  wasting  was  less  than  6  percent,  however,  specific 
districts  data  show  high  proportion  of  child  wasting.      The  results  showed  that  children 
from large families and families headed by the young and the elderly had a higher chance 
of  becoming  wasted.  Hence  children  in  these  households  had  a  higher  chance  of  dying.  
The family size contributed to child wasting due to the intra household’s food distribution 
in  households.  Therefore,  children  between  6  to  24  months  in  larger  families  and 
households headed by the elderly are at risk of being wasted in all the 48 districts.  

The survey established that about three quarters of the children who were severely wasted 
had fever, cough and diarrhea while all the children who were moderately wasted had all 
the  three  illnesses.  This  shows  that  these  illness  might  have  contributed  to  the  wasting 
state  of  the  children.  Studies  have  shown  that  illnesses  such  as  diarrhea  increases  the 
nutrient  loss  from  the  body  and  reduces  appetite  hence  reducing  the  food  intake  and 
increasing the likelihood of wasting. 

Further,  the  survey  revealed  that  interventions  such  as  supplementary  and  therapeutic 
feeding were only available in few districts with limited coverage in each of the districts. 
Therefore,  vulnerable  children  would  have  been  missed  at  targeting  stage  of  the 
intervention.  

 
Recommendations 

Short term  

  Children  in  the  moderate  and  severe  wasted  should  be  considered  for 
supplementary  and  therapeutic  feeding.    The  feeds  should  provide 
adequate  nutrient  requirement  for  the  children.  The  targeting  should 
consider  Child  headed  households,  households  headed  by  the  elderly  and 
children from larger families. 

  The child rations should be large enough to support the food needs of the 
women. This will take care of the intra household’s food distribution in the 
households  since  most  wasted  children  normally  come  from  the  poorest 
segments of the population. 

72 

 

 

 

 

  There  is  need  to  intensify  the  monitoring  of  nutritional  status  of  children 
and mothers to detect under - nutrition early and target support towards the 
vulnerable households in the communities. 

  Scale up the supplementary feeding programs and therapeutic programs to 
cover  vulnerable  districts  where  wasting  is  high  among  children  and 
women. The districts  where supplementary  feeding needs to  be scaled up 
include  Kalabo,  Lukulu,  Shangombo,  Nalolo,  Chipata,  Nyimba,  Petauke, 
Sinda,  Mwinilunga,  Choma,  Gwembe,  Namwala,  Masaiti,  Limulunga, 
Sioma,  Samfya  and  Zimba.  For  therapeutic  programmes,  the  districts 
include Kalabo, Mulobezi, Mongu, Senanga, Shangombo, Kapiri Mposhi, 
Chadiza,  Lundazi,  Sinda,  Ikelenge,  Masaiti,  Chama,  Mafinga,  Mpika, 
Limulunga, Sikongo Sioma and Siavonga. 

Medium term  

  Promote food diversification to help in promoting diet diversity among the 

households 

  Promote food storage for consumption and advocate for less sale on food 

assets from communities who depend on own production for livelihood. 

  Promote infant feeding programs in the community. 
 

 Improve  the  service  delivery  to  reduce  childhood  illnesses  such  as 
diarrhoea and malaria. 

 

5.4. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene 

 

Conclusion 

  The  population  which  reported  main  water  sources  that  were  affected  (that  is 
lower  water  level  than  in  previous  years  same  time)  is  2,  585,983  people  or 
430,997 households. The population that reported main water sources which dried 
up is 1,082,752 people or 180,459 households. 

(Western  Province);  Mwinilunga  and 

  The  worst  affected  districts  were  Kaoma,  Kalabo,  Mitete,  Sikongo,  Sioma  and 
(North-Western 
Luampa 
Province);  Vubwi,  Sinda,  Chipta,  Chadiza,  Petauke  and  Lundazi  (Eastern 
Province);  Zimba,  Namwala,  Gwembe,  Kazungula,  Choma,  Kalomo  (Southern 
Province);  Lufwanyama  (Copperbelt  Province);  and  Mafinga  and  Mpika 
(Muchinga Province).  

Ikelenge 

  Majority of households in the surveyed districts did not treat their drinking water. 
  A large number of households in the assessed districts did not have any toilets and 

practice open defeacation.  The population which reported not having sanitation 
facilities stood at 927,551 people (154,592 households). Districts where 
households do not have sanitation facilities were mainly in Western Province. 

  Most of the households washed their hands with the commonest scouring agents 

used being soap and ash.

Recommendations 

Short – term (WASH) 
In terms of water sources (working in liaison with MMEWD, MLGH, MOCTA, D-
WASHE, DDMC and Satellite Disaster Management Committees): 

  Assess and search for new water sources in needy areas; 
  Drill boreholes in areas where water points (21 percent) have dried and where the 

distance from household to water point is more than 500m; and 

  Continuous monitoring the situation in case of more water points drying out and 

determining alternative water sources. 

  Plan for operation and maintenance of existing water infrastructure. 

 

In terms of sanitation facilities and Hygiene (working with MLGH, MOCTA, MOH, 
MCDMCH, D-WASHE, DDMC and Satellite Disaster Management Committees): 

  Construct demonstration latrines at the schools, health centres, rural community 
centres (markets, faith centers, and traditional chiefs’ palaces) as well as latrines 
for vulnerable households. Work with households to build robust and appropriate 
latrine versions from the start, even though the latrines may be basic.  

  The government at national, provincial and districts levels should encourage the 

formation of a practical WASH Chiefdom and Community Action Plans for 
improving WASH access generally; 

  Promoting CLTS, monitoring and maintaining ODF status, maintaining a clean 

environment generally, and Make use of traditional leaders, local religious leaders 
and the influence and opportunities they have in bringing messages of personal 
cleanliness and well-being to their community.  

  There is need to increase availability of chlorine at rural health centers  level in all 

the affected districts 

o  Create WASH awareness programme 

 

Medium and long term (WASH) 
In terms of sanitation facilities and Hygiene (working with MLGH, MOCTA, MOH, 
MCDMCH, D-WASHE, DDMC and Satellite Disaster Management Committees): 

  Community involvement in planning, design and construction of water 
infrastructure (e.g., small dams and ancillary works) and in watershed 
management 

  Piloting and promoting of water supply and sanitation technology options that are 

climate resilient. 

 
In terms of sanitation facilities and Hygiene (working with MLGH, MOCTA, MOH, 
MCDMCH, D-WASHE, DDMC and Satellite Disaster Management Committees): 

  Provide external technical advice in challenging environments while ensuring full 
consultation with beneficiaries regarding technical challenges and solutions. Some 
“Smart” subsidies could be targeted to particularly vulnerable groups (including 

74 

 

 

 

 

 

cash transfers), or to households facing significant technical and physical 
challenges to latrine building (mason/ artisan technical support).  

  Build sanitation shops at District/Chiefdom level to sell sanitation facilities and 

give advice on improved sanitation facility construction, operation and 
maintenance
