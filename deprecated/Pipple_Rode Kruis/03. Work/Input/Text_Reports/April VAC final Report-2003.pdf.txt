How People Survived between March 2002 and April 2003 

 

 

(cid:1)  Between March 2002 and April 2003, most people in Zambia met their kilocalorie/energy 
requirements. For those under stress coping strategies  focused  mainly  on  changes to food 
consumption rather than strategies that impact on household assets.   

(cid:1)  Food  relief  made  some  contribution  to  livelihoods  in  the  southern  frequently  drought 
affected maize growing areas – providing upto10-15% of annual kilocalorie requirements.  
However, targeting still remains a problem and weakened the impact of the food relief on 
most vulnerable households. 

Current Food Security Situation and Scenario for 2004 

 

(cid:1)  The  Food  Security  situation  in  Zambia  has  improved  and  only  0.06%  of  the  population 
(60,000) will require targeted relief of 1,369 MT of cereal over a 5 month period (October 
2003 to February 2004). Any food aid must be distributed commensurate with the existing 
cereal gaps in each district.  

(cid:1)  Six districts will require assistance while 4 will need monitoring. The districts affected are 
Chama,  Itezi-Itezi,  Kazungula,  Luangwa,  Monze  and  Sinazongwe.  The  districts  that  will 
require  monitoring  or  contingency  planning  are  Gwembe,  Kalabo,  Shangombo  and 
Zambezi. 

(cid:1)  Generally food availability and access across the country has improved. 

 

(cid:1)  The situation is expected to remain as such in view of the increased  cereal production for 

2002/3 season and a good input subsidy programme for small-scale farmers. 

 

Linkages between Food Security and other Cross-Cutting Issues 

 

(cid:1)  Households directly affected by HIV/AIDS where more likely to cite lack of labour as 
reason for limiting cultivated land compared to households not affected by HIV/AIDS.  

 
(cid:1)  There are many other factors that affect food production including economic position and 

characteristics of members of household and the inability to assess these may mask the 
specific impacts of HIV/AIDS at household level.  

(cid:1)  There is also low prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the rural areas of Zambia (10%). The findings 
failed to provide hard evidence to support the notion of “the new variant famine” operating 
in the country.

Executive Summary 
 
In  June  2002,  following  two  consecutive  years  of  drought  (2000-2001  and  2001-2002  cropping 
seasons)  that  reduced  the  national  cereal  production  particularly  in  the  southern  parts  of  the 
country, combined with high levels of poverty, HIV/AIDS and 47% chronic malnutrition (stunting) 
gave rise to serious concerns that unless an appropriate response was implemented there would be 
a  serious  food  crises.    The  National  Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee,  a  consortium  of: 
government,  NGO  and  UN  agencies  decided  to  conduct  a  series  of  food  security  assessments  in 
August and December 2002 and in April 2003.  This was part of a regional initiative coordinated 
by  the  Southern  Africa  Development  Community  (SADC)  Food,  Agriculture  and  Natural 
Resources (FANR) Vulnerability  Assessment Committee.  The purpose of these assessments was 
to  identify  needs,  inform  food  aid  distribution priorities  within  the  country  and  guide/inform  on-
going food security monitoring.   
 
The first two assessments focused on looking at the cereal deficit within the country and concluded 
that  2.4  million  people  required  food  assistance  between  September  and  November  2002 
increasing  to  2.9  million  between  December  and  March  2003.    The  cumulative  cereal  food  aid 
requirement September – March was calculated to be 224,000 MT.  However, after a limited donor 
response, linked to the GZR decision to turn down the offer of GM food assistance, just about 50% 
of  the  food  aid  requirement  was  distributed.    The  nutrition  status  surveys  collected  post-harvest 
2002  and  pre-harvest  2003  show  that  nutritional  status  remained  stable  throughout  2002-2003, 
despite  the  reduced  scale  of  the  food  relief intervention.    With  this in  mind  the  VAC  decided to 
focus the last assessment on looking at livelihoods, specifically how people lived last year and the 
contribution of  food aid, in addition to identifying needs  for the  coming 12 months.   To achieve 
this, the Zambia April 2003 Vulnerability Assessment used two investigative methods, namely the 
Household/Key  Informants  Survey  and  the  Food  Economy  Approach.    Information  from  both 
sources was triangulated together with information from other relevant secondary sources: MACO 
crop  production  and  livestock  data,  data  on  imports,  health,  sanitation  and  population.    The 
combination of approaches enabled a balanced story about how households survived and met their 
food requirements in the light of last season’s cereal shortage. 
 

Findings - How rural households survived in 2002/3 

 

Macro-level information highlights the fact that maize production has been following a downward 
trend since market liberalization was introduced in 1991.  Whilst maize production has been on the 
decrease, there has been an increase in out-grower associations and contract farming arrangements.  
In  addition,  “informal”  imports  of  maize  (reported  to  range  from  60-300,000MT  by  2002)  are 
significantly impacting on the operations of the market, including cereal availability and prices.  
 
In  2002/03,  in  all  the  assessed  areas,  even  households  considered  as  poor  were  able  to  access 
sufficient  food  to  meet  their  basic  annual  calorific  requirements  of  2100kcal  per  person  per  day.  
The  contribution  from  food  aid  over  a  12-month  period  was  less  than  5%  in  all  districts  except 
districts  within  the  Gwembe  valley  (zone  11),  Luangwa  valley  (zone  12  a)  and  parts  of 
Kazungula/Sesheke where up to 10-15% of kilocalories came from food relief.  
 
How  people  met  their  energy  requirements  varied  slightly  between  different  areas.    However, 
options  adopted  were  primarily  a  combination  of  crops  grown  on  their  farms  (maize,  cassava, 
pumpkins and other vegetables), market purchase and exchange (both barter and labour) for food.  
Income to enable purchase came from sale of milk/livestock, casual labour, cross-border trade and 

 

vi

other sources.  A combination of these options has been utilised by rural households throughout the 
last decade and the use of new or unusual coping mechanisms in 2002/03 was limited. 
 
Districts with low food crop production (covering 4 months consumption or less) 
 
These  are  maize  growing  districts  that  are  frequently  affected  by  droughts/floods.    Specifically 
districts  within  the  following  livelihood  zones:  Luangwa  valley  (12a),  Gwembe  valley  (11), 
Shangombo  (9),  Kazungula/Sesheke  (7a),  and  Mambwe  (12b).    Whilst  these  zones  were  able  to 
meet  their  basic  energy  requirements,  in  most  of  these  zones,  own  crop  production  (maize, 
pumpkin and other vegetables) provided less than 30% of  energy  requirements.   However, other 
options  were  available  –  particularly  casual  labour,  sale  of  livestock,  fishing  and  trade  –  all  of 
which  provided  cash  to  buy  food.    In  the  Gwembe  valley  (11),  there  are  a  wide  range  of 
employment opportunities including gemstone and  coal  mining;  working  for  commercial  fishing, 
crocodile farming, sugar and vegetable companies; participating in cotton out grower schemes; and 
working for civil servants and NGOs.  Kazungula/Sesheke (7a) has an unusually high reliance on 
forest  foods  particularly  fruits  and  nuts  (including  the  mungongo  nut  which  is  both  oil  rich  and 
valuable).  In this area, Namibia was both an important market in which to trade livestock, timber, 
forest  products  and  handicrafts  for  a  variety  of  groceries  as  well  as  a  source  of  employment  on 
commercial farms, herding, doing domestic work. 
  
Districts with higher food crop production (covering 5 months consumption or more) 
 
These  can  be  grouped  into  three  types:  maize  producing  but  not  frequently  affected  by  drought, 
cassava/maize producing and  cassava producing.   In these zones, own production  makes a larger 
contribution to food intake and households were able to access 2100 kcals pppd or more.   Other 
sources of food included fish, game meat, and vegetables.  Income sources included cotton/tobacco 
production, sale of maize and cassava, casual labour on commercial farms and in some areas cross-
border trade. 
 
Impact of food relief 
 
Food  relief  made  some  contribution  to  livelihoods  in  the  southern  frequently  drought  affected 
maize  growing  areas  –  providing  upto10-15%  of  annual  kilocalorie  requirements.    In  other 
districts, the contribution of food relief was lower (0-5%).   However, the late distribution of much 
of the food relief means that its contribution to diets was slightly higher during a 3-6 month period 
and may have enabled households to focus on weeding their own plots rather than looking for work 
elsewhere.      Food  relief  was  generally  not  targeted  in  “worst  affected”  districts  rather  most 
households  received  4-6  times  over  a  period  of  up  to  6-9  months.    Limited  targeting  further 
weakened the impact of the food relief on most vulnerable households. 
 
Coping strategies 
 
Most zones reported strategies that focused on changes in food consumption.  This included: 
getting food from other sources, changing from preferred foods to less expensive foods, reducing 
the number of nshima meals per day and sometimes not eating nshima, and eating other foods and 
vegetables or eating only vegetables.  The fact that expenditure, income and migration coping 
strategies were adopted by a limited number of households highlights the value of the various 
economic activities that have been developed over recent years in many parts of the country.

vii

 
The present harvest is reported to be a “bumper harvest”1, however late and erratic rains in some 
areas  and  floods  in  other  areas  of  Southern  and  Western  provinces,  may  lead  to  pockets  where 
maize  production  is  worse  than  last  year  or  destroyed  through  flooding.      Unless  imports  are 
regulated  –  the  increase  in  production  combined  with  imports  may  have  a  negative  impact  on 
pricing structures. 
 
In areas of the south where maize production is expected to be patchy, most households will meet 
their  requirements  through  their  usual  livelihood  strategies  –  a  combination  of  labour  exchange, 
sale of other crops and livestock.   The most vulnerable (very poor) in zones in which last years’ 
production  (cereal/cassava)  together  with  food  relief  exceeded  this  years  production  of 
cereal/cassava  may  struggle.    The  most  vulnerable  households  were  households  which  had  less 
livestock,  cultivated  less  land,  and  had  annual  incomes  in  the  range  of  ZMK100,  000  - 
500,000/year  (1  US$  =  ZMK5,000  approximately).  Two  types  of  very  poor  households  were 
identified:  labour  poor  households  and  households  with  labour,  households  with  labour  could 
participate in FFW programmes. 
 
The  Food  Security  situation  in  Zambia  has improved  and  only  0.06%  of  the  population  (60,000) 
will require targeted relief of 1,369 MT of cereal which must be distributed commensurate with the 
existing  cereal  gaps  in  each  district.  Six  districts  will  require  assistance  while  4  will  need 
monitoring.  The  districts  affected  are  Chama,  Itezi  Itezi,  Kazungula,  Lwangwa,  Monze  and 
Sinazongwe.  The  districts  that  will  require  monitoring  are  Gwembe,  Kalabo,  Shangombo  and 
Zambezi. 
   
Conclusions 
 
The  assessed  areas  particularly  in  the  frequently  drought  affected  areas  have been  moving  away 
from a dependency on maize production over several years and have diversified both their sources 
of  food and  income.  Economic  connections  within  and  between  food  economy  zones  are  strong. 
Cross-border trade was important for several of the districts visited.   Looking beyond agricultural 
production at the wider local economy shows that the majority of households are not experiencing 
a food gap. Therefore, food aid interventions are not recommended this year except within limited 
targeted areas and populations.  
 
However,  certain  of  the  practices pursued  in different  zones  may  produce  longer-term  problems. 
Certain  income  generating  activities  will  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  environment  unless 
appropriate controls are put in place e.g. crop production using the slash and burn farming systems 
(chitemene), charcoal production (Northern Province), timber logging and wild product collection 
e.g. grass, reeds (Kazungula/Sesheke), and  fishing (Luapula Region and the  Gwembe Valley.  In 
most  parts  of  the  country,  programmes  in  the  coming  year  should  focus  on  reducing  chronic 
vulnerability,  through  supporting/strengthening  some  of  the  economic  activities  that  households 
have developed in recent years (e.g. support to marketing of crops and livestock). 
 
Households  who  were  directly  affected  by  HIV/AIDS2  were  more  likely  to cite  labour  shortages 
within  the  household  as  an  important  issue  compared  to  households  not  affected  by  HIV/AIDS. 
The same applies to a variety of coping strategies. These responses were signs of households under 
stress.    However,  in  terms  of a  reduction  in  the  amount  of  food  produced  or  differences  in  food

HIV/AIDS.

production, the data of the Zambian VAC survey on the whole showed no real differences between 
households categorized by the presence of one of the proxy variables and households not affected 
by HIV/AIDS. Efforts should be made that will mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS in rural areas by 
assisting households affected by HIV/AIDS to become more food secure.  
 
The  findings  of  the  Zambian  VAC  failed  to  provide  hard  evidence  to  support  the  notion  of  “the 
new variant famine” operating in the country. It would appear if climatic conditions, food pricing 
policies, the lack of agricultural support and extension services, environmental degradation, a lack 
of infrastructure and poverty play a larger role in inadequate harvests than HIV/AIDS. Whether the 
same  can be said of  countries with significantly  higher HIV prevalence rates than those  found in 
the rural areas of Zambia (11 % of adults), remains unclear.

Background  

INTRODUCTION 

1.0 
 
1.1 
 
Zambia has an estimated population of 9.8 million3 of which 60% live in rural areas.  For additional 
demographic, social and economic indicators see Table 1.1.   
 
In  the  last  10  years,  droughts  of  varying  severity  have  occurred  in  1991-92,  1994-95, 2000-01,  and 
2001-02and In addition, annual rainfall in the Southern parts of the country over the last 10 years has 
been particularly varied. Nationally, as a result of the drought in Southern Africa (including Zambia), 
increased  food  purchases  by  government  and  uncertainties  over  the  future  of  the  mining  sector 
following  the  pull-out  of  Anglo  American  Corporation  from  the  Konkola  Copper  Mines,  the  GDP 
growth was just 3% as compared to 5.2% in 20014.   
 
Within  the  agricultural  sector,  the  real  growth  rate  has  fluctuated  significantly  in  the  last  10  years 
mainly  due  to  an  over  dependence  on  seasonal  rainfall,  market  liberalization,  reduced  investment  in 
maize  production  and  reduction  in  livestock  numbers  following  disease  outbreaks  (particularly 
ECF/corridor  disease  in  the  late  90s  and  anthrax  in  2001).  Over  the  last  decade,  this  sector’s 
contribution to the GDP has averaged 18 percent.   
 
At  a  district  level,  recurrent  droughts  and  market  liberalization  initiated  in  1991/2  have  led  to:    the 
collapse  of  the  traditional  credit  delivery  which  focused  mainly  on  maize  seed  and  fertilizer  inputs; 
crop  diversification  and  an  increase  in  out-grower  associations  and  contract  farming  arrangements5 
especially for cotton, tobacco, paprika and castor oil6. Cattle holdings in 2002, suggest that herd sizes 
have returned to pre 2001 levels of approximately 2,500,0007.   
 
Following  two  consecutive  years  of  drought  in  the  2000-2001  and 2001-2002  cropping seasons  that 
reduced the national cereal production particularly in the southern and western parts of the country, the 
National Vulnerability  Assessment Committee a  consortium of government, NGO and UN agencies) 
decided to conduct a series of food security assessments in August and December 2002 and in April 
2003.    This  was  part  of  a  regional  initiative  coordinated  by  the  Southern  Africa  Development 
Community  (SADC)  Food,  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources  (FANR)  Vulnerability  Assessment 
Committee.    The  purpose  of  these  assessments  was  to  assess  needs,  inform  food  aid  distribution 
priorities  within  the  country  and  guide/inform  on-going  food  security  monitoring.    The  first  two 
assessments focused on looking at the cereal deficit within the country.     
 
Following  a  review  of  the  previous  assessments  a  number  of  nutrition  surveys  which  suggested  that 
nutritional status had remained stable during the  previous 12 months; food  relief data indicating that 
less than 50% of the requested food relief had been distributed; and additional information on informal

imports8 of maize and other goods ('Hidden' regional trade was estimated to be worth at least US$ 600 
million and worth more than legal regional trade9). The national VAC decided that the last assessment 
in the series  would  focus on livelihoods, and look at how people lived last  year and the  role of  food 
aid.   
 
1.2  General Objective of the Assessment 
 
To assess vulnerability and livelihood patterns in Zambia. 
 
1.2.1  Specific Assessment Objectives 
 
The specific objectives of the assessments were as follows: 
 

•  To  have  an  understanding  of  people’s  livelihoods,  how  they  have  survived  in  the  last  12 

months (April 2002 – March 2003) including the role of food aid.   

•  To project access to food from April 2003 to March 2004 based upon available crop production 

figures for the current season  

•  Develop a basic scenario for food security needs during this period (both food relief and other 

interventions). 

•  To take account of potential interactions between HIV/AIDS and food security.   

 
To  achieve  these  objectives,  the  national  VAC  decided  to  utilize  2  survey  methodologies:  the 
Household/Key  Informants  Survey  and  the  Food  Economy  Approach  and  do  a  joint  analysis  of  the 
data collected together with information from secondary sources.

1.3  Methodology 
 
1.3.1  Livelihood Based Analysis 
 
Livelihood based analysis is a holistic tool for gathering information about people’s patterns of income 
and expenditure, the types of food people eat, and how food is accessed (It may be noted that where 
people  live  and  their  socio-economic  background  control  people’s  food  security  and  livelihoods).  
Analytically, areas with broad livelihood similarities are grouped into livelihood zones.  Livelihoods-
based  Vulnerability  Assessment  focuses  on  the  analysis  of  food  sources  and  incomes  by  livelihood 
zone  and  wealth  group.  To  achieve  this,  the  Zambia  April  Vulnerability  Assessment  used  two 
investigative  methods,  namely  the  Household/Key  Informants  Survey  and  the  Food  Economy 
Approach.  
 
The  Household/Key  Informants  Survey  is  an  important  tool  for  gathering  information  within  and 
across households, and has been used widely in Zambia. In April’s survey, the household instrument 
queried  people  as  to  their  household  demographic  and  health  characteristics,  asked  them  to  quantify 
their own-production and livestock holdings between 2002 and 2003, ascertained what they thought to 
be limiting factors of production, listed coping strategies employed over the previous year, and ranked 
incomes  and  expenditures  over  the  past  12  months.    The  Key  Informants  survey  compared  current 
with April 2002 sales and purchase prices for staple foods, livestock, and cash crops, ascertained water 
sources  and  means  of  waste  disposal,  and  queried  as  to  newly  employed  coping  strategies  for  both 
food and income. 
 
The  Food  Economy  Approach  examined  livelihoods  within  zones,  and  within  and  across  wealth 
groups.    The  approach  quantified  people’s  access  to  2100  kilocalories  of  food  per  day  through 
production,  purchase,  exchange,  gifts/relief,  wild  food  consumption;  potential  gaps  and  income 
sources for purchasing food is quantified. In addition, the approach identified potential hazards in each 
food economy zone and looked at how people might respond to these. Information collected enabled 
comparisons to be made among wealth groups and food economy/livelihood zones. 
 
Both methods have been widely used in other countries. 
 
1.3.2  Survey  Design,  Stratification  and  Sampling  used  in  the  Household  and Key  Informants 

Survey 

 
Administratively,  Zambia  is  divided  into  nine  provinces.  Each  province  is  in  turn  subdivided  into 
districts. For statistical purposes each district is subdivided into Standard Enumeration Areas (SEAs). 
Zambia has 72 districts and 16,000 SEAs.   CSO selected the SEAs using a 2-stage stratified-cluster 
sample method.  The SEAs were first stratified by livelihood zone using the NVAC-modified FHANIS 
livelihood map.  Subsequently, 114 SEAs were selected proportional to the population size of the zone 
based on the 2000 census.   For the design of this survey only the rural part of the sampling frame was 
used.    Time  constraints  later  reduced  this  selection  to  72  SEAs,  randomly  selected  from  within  the 
original set. 
 
At the second stage, 4 villages were randomly selected in each sampled SEA.  Within each village, a 
household list was collected/compiled and between 4 to 6 households randomly chosen for interview. 

 

3

Random  number  tables  were  provided  to  the  enumerators.  For  Key  Informant  interviews,  4-6 
community  leaders  were  assembled  for  a  focus  group  discussion  with  participation  of  women 
emphasized.  Both the focus group interview and household questionnaire used open and closed ended 
questions  to  gather  information.  The  total  number  of  households  covered  in  the  survey  was  1448, 
whilst  69  key  informant  interviews  were  conducted.  Appendix  1  and  Appendix  2  shows  map  of 
SEA’s, and the sampling frame. 
 
1.3.3  Survey design and selection of Zones for Food Economy Approach 
 
Initially,  livelihood  economy  zones  (Livelihood  Economy  Zones  (LEZs)):  areas  where  households 
share similar methods of accessing food and income) were identified using the following criteria: 
 

•  Zones clearly defined on both the FHANIS and NVAC livelihood maps  
•  Zones identified as needing relief food in both the August and December assessments (4 out of 

6 zones)  

•  Zones in diverse parts of the country (i.e. to bring out contrasts/differences in livelihoods)  
•  Accessibility (i.e. flooded areas were inaccessible at this time). 

 
Within LEZs, purposive sampling was used to select key informants, sites, and focus groups.  Focus 
group  discussions,  with  at  least  4-6  key  informants,  were  held  with  district  level  GRZ  staff,  NGOs, 
and church organizations to facilitate the identification of 2 “representative” villages (“typical” of the 
zone,  neither  the  worst  nor  the  best  and  taking  population  density  into  consideration).    In  addition, 
these  interviews  contributed  to  the  development  of  wealth  group  descriptions,  decadal  timelines  of 
production and hazards, and seasonal  calendars. In each village and at the  community level, 4  focus 
group  discussions  were  held  with  both  men  and  women  separately  and  together.  These  were  people 
who  represented  their  community.    These  interviews  provided  a  crosscheck  to  complete  the  wealth 
group rankings and descriptions, built up a history of the area, and developed the seasonal calendars. 
Information was also collected on local units of measure and prices of foodstuffs, both through market 
and household visits.  
 
These  focus  group  interviews  were  followed  by  8  interviews  with  4-6  individuals  representing  each 
wealth  groups.  Using  a  local  (relative)  definition  of  wealth  (not  absolute  definition  of  wealth),  the 
interviews  focused  on  the  poor  and  middle  wealth  group,  but  where  time  allowed  also  developed 
descriptions of the very poor and/or the better off.   In these wealth group discussions, information was 
collected on sources of food, income, and expenditures for a “typical” family within the wealth group.  
Calculations  were  made 
least  2100 
kilocalories/person/day.10  (average  energy  requirements,  Sphere  standard)  The  information  collected 
was summarized and triangulated at every stage of the process to identify both agreement within the 
team and ensure that any differences were cross-checked/followed up in the field the following day. 
 
1.3.3.1 
 
In 2000, the first attempt at coming up with a Livelihoods Zone map of Zambia was made. This was 
against  a  backdrop  of  the  need  for  a  food  security  analysis  approach  that  would  take  into  account 
                                                
10 Since all nutrition surveys in the past year indicate no significant deterioration in wasting among children under-5 years 
of age, the implication is that all age groups across the country covered their requirements of  2100 kcal/person/day.

Zambia  with  an  accompanying  table  of  livelihood  zone  descriptions.    This  was  later  modified  in 
collaboration with FHANIS and the map in Figure 1.1 compiled.  Appendix 3 gives further description 
of each zone.

Training

Following one week of training and pre-testing of the instruments, the  field  component  commenced. 
The  “households”  group  fielded  6  teams  of  4  people  for  21  days  (1st  to  21st  April),  while  the  Food 
Economy group sent 3 teams of 4 people for the 21 days that included some days of analysis. A one-
day meeting to share findings of both approaches was held on 30th April to look at the ways in which 
the two approaches  would complement  each other during analysis.  The two teams  were  made up of 
members of the NVAC as well as consultants from UCT Associates and FEWSNET. 
 
1.5 
 
Nutrition status data collected in Zambia between May 2002 and March 2003 show that rates of global 
acute  malnutrition  (GAM)  have  been  stable  at  around  a  5%  prevalence  rate.  The  household 
questionnaire quantified the contribution of the main sources of cereals and tubers to the energy intake 

Analytical Framework

by zone throughout the country.   The food economy detailed how people last year accessed their 2100 
kcal/person/day  in  6  zones.    Within  each  zone,  this  information,  combined  with  the  household 
questionnaire’s  information  on  other  food  sources,  coping  strategies,  and  incomes,  with  additional 
information  from  secondary  sources,  provided  an  overview  of  how  people  met  their  food 
requirements.    
 
The primary data for the household survey was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences 
SPSS 11.1 and  ArcView  Geographical Information System  (GIS).  The process  made use of  un-
weighted  average  production  per  household,  calculated  from  the  total  average  production  and  total 
average  household  size  for  each  LEZ;  this  was  used  instead  of  the  weighted  (individual  household 
size) average production to smooth the influence of data outliers.   During the analysis (10-22 May), 
the  emphasis  was  placed  on  the  triangulation  of  data  using  primary  sources  collected  during  the 
surveys (household and key informant questionnaires, food economy focus-group interviews), MACO 
crop  production  data,  data  on  imports,  health,  sanitation,  population,  and  other  relevant  secondary 
sources.    The  combination  of  approaches  enabled  a  rational  story  to  be  developed  about  how 
households survived and met their food requirements in light of last season’s cereal shortage. 
 
1.6 
 
Timing  was  a  major  constraint  as  the  surveys  took  place  when  some  areas  were  inaccessible  due  to 
rain  and  damaged  infrastructure.  In  addition  some  household  members  were  away  tending  to  their 
fields  and  often  had  to  be  waited  for.    This  reduced  the  number  of  SEAs  visited  and  households 
interviewed, as well as limiting the food economy study to 6 out of the planned 9 zones.

2.1 
 
Total  staple  cereal  production  (excluding  wheat)  for  the  2001-2002  farming  season  in  Zambia 
amounted  to  667,667  MT  with  carry  over  cereal  stocks  from  the  previous  year  totaling  23,000  MT. 
This is against human consumption requirements of 1,160,969 MT of staple cereal for the 2002-2003 
marketing year. The total staple cereal deficit over the same period amounted to 671,766 MT.  
The  food deficit  was reduced by  cassava and sweet potato production  where surplus production  was 
experienced.  The  previous  VAC  reports  (August  and  December  2002)  had  estimated  a  cumulative 
cereal food aid requirement for the period September to March 2003 as 224,000 MT to assist a total of 
2.9 million people.   
 
By December 2002, when the second  round of  food need assessments  was  carried out, the  Zambian 
Government had  facilitated the importation of 46,854 MT of  relief  maize, of  which 19,288 MT was 
brought  in  through  the  Food  Reserve  Agency  (FRA),  and  27,666  MT  through  private  firms.  In 
addition, starting from August 2002 the World Food Programme (WFP) had imported a total of 79,194 
MT of cereal under its Emergency Operations (EMOP) which was distributed as relief.  Thus a total of 
126,048 MT (46,854 + 79,194 MT) were brought in against a demand of 224,000 MT or 56%. 
  
2.2 
 
By the end of 2002, the economy had attained a 3.0% growth in gross domestic product compared to 
5.2% in 2001. Growth  for 2003 is forecast at 4% or  more. Overall, the  major issues in the economy 
were privatization, economic diversification and poverty reduction. 
 
Annualized inflation for 2003 is targeted at 17.9%, down from 26.7% attained at the end of 2003. The 
high  inflation  achieved  in  2002  has  worsened  effective  demand  for  agricultural  produce.  Weak 
consumer demand will continue to have an adverse impact on the economy and the projected inflation 
target may not be achieved as long as consumer demand remains weak.  Inflation will remain a serious 
problem  as  long  as  the  monetary  and  fiscal  measures  used  by  government  are  unable  to  contain  the 
depreciation of the Kwacha. 
 
The exchange rate averaged ZMK 4,800 per 1 US$ during the year, implying marginal appreciation of 
the  Kwacha.    Commercial  lending  rates  continued  to  average  41%  whilst  the  savings  rates  have 
remained  static  at  5%.  The  interest  rates  remained  unfavorable  for  borrowing  and  this  will  be  the 
situation as long as inflation remains high. 
 
2.2.1.1  
 
The area harvested for maize in Zambia has been slowly declining since 1989/90 (Figure 2.1 illustrates 
this  trend).    In  Zambia,  the  area  under  cultivation  appears  to  be  a  major  factor  in  food  security  and 
vulnerability.  In the last 14 years, the area harvested has gradually declined, pulling down with it the 
average yield. The drought years of 2000-01, 2001-02, 1994-95 and 1991-92 resulted in corresponding 
decline  in  area  harvested  whilst  the  observed  peaks  in  1992/93  and  1995/96  are  explained  by

drought in Zambia was in 1991/92 when production fell far below the recent five-year average.

Food Access 

The observed trend can be explained by the liberalization of agricultural markets that has resulted in 
farmers producing maize only when it is economically viable to do so.  
 
2.2.1.2  
 
Ndola rural (Zone 2a), Mansa (Zone 1b) and Chipata (Zone 5b) experienced relatively high prices in 
March 2002 while lower prices were experienced in Mongu and Kabwe rural (Zone 5a).    
As shown in Figure 2.2, there has been a fall in maize prices in all provincial centers, making access to 
maize  relatively favorable this year, except  in Mongu (Zone 8), where prices have risen.   The reason 
why Mongu is experiencing higher prices compared to Kabwe this year is because: Mongu is a typical 
deficit  area  and  Kabwe  a  surplus  area.    Figures  2.3a  and  2.3b  show  how  the  prices  have  behaved 
during the period March 2002 and March 2003 in deficit and surplus regions.

a)  Both surplus and deficit areas experienced relative stability in maize prices after an initial fall 

 

in March 2002 with the deficit areas experiencing relatively higher prices than surplus areas. 

b)  However in all locations the prices during the period under review were above the recent five-

year average implying that access problems affected all areas at varying degrees.  

c)  Maize prices when compared to prices of other cereals and tubers (sorghum, cassava, and rice) 
are  lower  (see  Figures  2.3a  and  2.3b),  even  in  Mongu  a  predominately  cassava  and  rice 
growing area.  

d)  In  maize  deficit  producing  areas  access  to  staples  will  continue  to  be  a  problem  whilst 

alternatives to maize exhibit higher prices.

The  price  of  maize  grain  continues  to  be  determined  by  land  use  capability  and  weather  as  well  as 
including proximity to the  market. In addition, other determinants of price  will be the terms of trade 
with other substitute cereals or tubers. This implies that price is particularly crucial to food access in 
maize deficit areas like Mongu where cassava prices have risen almost exponentially relative to maize.  
 
The present downward trend in maize grain prices is expected to continue until the end of the harvest 
(August / September) when most household stocks will start to run out. A number of factors support 
this  conclusion  including:  continued  import  of  maize  by  the  Government;  higher  than  expected 
production; and, according to the Agricultural Commodity Exchange April report complaints by some 
millers of poor quality maize caused by late rains in early April 2003. This has resulted in a reduction 
in the price millers are willing to pay for maize.  
 
In  agriculture,  the  Government  is  looking  towards  ensuring  timely  delivery  and  distribution  of 
agricultural inputs and the rehabilitation and development of infrastructure. The Zambian Government 
has also set aside  funds to tap the  massive potential in irrigation. Funding has also been set aside to 
establish the Crop Marketing Authority (CMA) that will build up the food security stocks and ensure 
that farmers have better prices at which to sell their produce. 
 
2.3 
 
The major nutrition problem in Zambia is chronic malnutrition. Data available on nutritional status is 
primarily  derived  from  anthropometric  measurement  on  children  under  five  years  of  age.  Three 
indicators  are  often  used,  height-for-age  (stunting)11,  weight-for-age  (underweight)12  and  weight  for 
height  (wasting)13.  Children  under  5  years  old  are  considered  the  most  vulnerable,  and  therefore 
children’s nutritional status is a good outcome indicator as it reflects both the general population and 
household’s food security situation. Trend data for analysis of nutrition status has been derived from 
secondary data using: 
 

Nutritional Situation 

 2001-2 Zambia Demographic Household Survey (ZDHS)  

• 
•  NGO nutritional surveys supported by UNICEF at districts level. 
•  Annual health statistical bulletin 2002, (Growth monitoring data from health facilities) 

 
The  underlying  causes  of  malnutrition  are  divided  into  three  categories  and  show  links  between 
inadequate  household  food  security,  basic  health  and  environmental  services  and  childcare  and 
feeding.  These  underlying  causes  are  further  influenced  by  factors  such  as  income,  wealth  of 
households,  distance  to  markets,  crops  grown  and  livestock  owned.  Likewise,  the  dependency  ratio 
also affects the capacity of households to assure their needs.  
 

                                                
11 Height-for-age: which shows linear growth and is a measure of long-term nutrition.  A child whose height is below two standard 
deviation of the Z-score is stunted or chronically malnourished.   Stunting is a result of long term deprivation due to repeated illnesses or 
inadequate dietary  intake 
12 . Weight-for-age  is a composite indicator of both linear growth and body proportion.  A child whose weight-for-age is below two 
standard deviation of Z-score is considered to be underweight.  A child can be underweight either because he is stunted or wasted.  
13 . Weight-for-height is a measure of fatness or thinness. A child whose weight in proportion to height is below two standard deviation 
is wasted.  Weight-for-height is an indicator of current nutritional status. It is sensitive to recent past illness or acute dietary intake. 
Wasting is a form of  acute malnutrition. 
 

 

11

Figure 2.4 represents trends in the three nutritional indicators between 1992 and 2002 using data from 
preliminary  ZDHS  2001/2.    The  results  document  a  gradual  increase  in  both  the  proportions  of 
children  stunted  and  underweight  and  a  stable  pattern  with  respect  to  the  level  of  wasting.  The 
prevalence of acute  malnutrition  (wasting)  ranged between 2.5% and 7.6% and has remained stable. 
These rates are within the global acceptable range and do not suggest a need for any emergency food.

The prevalence of wasting as captured in nutritional surveys in the respective districts (see Appendix 
4)  is  comparable  and  consistent  with  national  level  data  (See  Figure  2.5).  The  prevalence  of  acute 
malnutrition (wasting) ranged from between 2.4% (CARE, Kalomo, Dec 2002; CARE, Namwala, Jan 
2003) and 7.7% (Oxfam, Siavonga, Jan 2003).   
 
Stunting has increased over the last decade from. 40% in 1992, to 42% in 1996 and 47% in 2001-2002 
(ZDHS,  1992,  1996  &  2001/2).    The  rate  of  stunting  varies  between  35.6%  (Lusaka  Province)  and 
59.4% (Eastern Province).  Provinces that show high rates of stunting are: Eastern (59.4%), Luapula 
(57.6%), Northern (54.8%) and Central (45.9%) Provinces. 
 
Underweight as reported by the Health  Management  Information System  (HIMS, 2002) ranges  from 
14.2% (Copperbelt Province) and 33.1% (Luapula Province). For each of the provinces, the prevalence 
is  lower  than  in  1999.    Provinces  with  the  lowest  prevalence  are  Lusaka  (35.6%)  and  Copperbelt 
(39.9%). 
 
Limited  data  on  adult  malnutrition  has  been  collected  in  the  last  12  months.    Oxfam  in  Monze, 
Senanga  and  Siavonga  districts  measured  adults’  nutritional  status  using  MUAC  in  one  survey  in 
January/ February 2003. The measurements of mothers using MUAC showed that 0.4% to 2.3% of the 
mothers  were  presenting  with  10  -  14%  with  moderate  or  severe  malnutrition  (<23cm  and  <21cm 
respectively).   This does not indicate a large proportion of mothers having a MUAC varying greatly 
from the average. 
Data concerning adult malnutrition are limited and do not suggest a high prevalence of malnutrition.

Context of HIV/AIDS in Zambia 

Trend data suggests that chronic under-nutrition levels are increasing at both national and household 
levels.  Stunting  is  indicative  of  a  cumulative  problem  of  the  past.  Wasting  measurements  show  a 
somewhat static or insignificant movement implying that the general population is meeting their basic 
2100 kcal daily requirements. 
 
2.4  
 
Zambia  is  facing  an  HIV/AIDS  epidemic  of  considerable  proportions  (see  Figure  2.6a  and  b).  The 
recently completed Zambian Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) found that approximately 15% 
of the Zambian population aged 15-49 are HIV positive  (Central Statistical Office, Central Board of 
Health  and  ORC-Macro,  2002).  The  findings  from  this  population-based  survey  suggest  that  in  the 
younger  age  groups,  women  have  higher  infection  rates  than  men.  In  the  age  group  25-29 
approximately 25 % of women tested positive compared to 15 % of men. In the older age groups men 
predominate  among  those  infected  (see  Figure  2.6a).  Prevalence  data  do  not  provide  a  grasp  of  the 
annual  number  of  new  infections,  nor  can  it  provide  an  indication  of  how  long  ago  people  were 
infected. Nevertheless, the data indicate that large numbers of the Zambian population will fall ill and 

 

13

die  within  the  next  couple  of  years  with  multiple  health,  social,  economic  as  well  as  food  security 
consequences. 
 
Recent estimates by UNAIDS and the WHO put the number of people in Zambia that died of AIDS-
related  causes  at  120,000  in  the  year  2001.  These  organizations  estimate  that  there  are  currently 
570,000 children under 15 years in Zambia who have lost one parent or both parents to AIDS.

HIV prevalence rates differ markedly by province with the highest prevalence in Lusaka (25 %) and 
the  Copperbelt  (22  %)  provinces.  The  Northern  (8,8%)  and  North-Western  Provinces  (10  %)  have 
much lower infection rates. Differences in prevalence  rates by province  are largely a  function of the 
level of urbanisation in each province. The 2001-2002 ZDHS found that HIV infection differ markedly 
by place of residence. In urban areas the HIV prevalence were twice as high compared to rural areas 
(see Figure 2.6b).  
 
The Zambian VAC survey was confined to rural areas, and the lower prevalence of HIV in rural areas 
should be reflected in the findings of the survey, in terms of the impact the epidemic is having on rural 
households in general.

The main watersheds in Zambia are listed in the Table 2.1 below. The 10-year mean annual flow for 
these watersheds ranged from 330-1900 m³/s.  This is sufficient to meet Zambia’s domestic, industrial 
and  agricultural  requirements  and  if  utilised  for  irrigation  could  enhance  food  security  within  the 
country.

In 2002, the annual  mean  flow  was slightly above average  (355-1975m³/s).  This combined  with the 
government policy over the last 10 years of expanding access to water sources particularly in drought 
prone areas means that water availability did not deteriorate sufficiently in the 2002 drought to impact 
negatively on population health status, livestock access to water or the quantity of water available for 
irrigation14.

FINDINGS ON CURRENT HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY IN 2002/3 

3.0 
 
Data is presented by livelihood zones and covers a 12-month period from April 2002 to March 2003.  
The zones have been grouped by staple food production and consumption.  The four categories are:  
 

•  Dominant cassava consuming zones;  
•  Mixed cassava/cereal;  
•  Cereal consuming zones - frequently flood/drought affected, and  
•  Cereal consuming but less frequently affected by drought.    

 
3.1  How Rural Households survived in 2002/03  
 
The main sources15 of cereal and tubers identified were sufficient to provide on average 70% of energy 
requirements16  in  most  zones  except  the  Southern  zones:  11-Gwembe  valley  (53%),  12  a-Luangwa 
(48%) and 7b-Chongwe (57%) and the Western  zone 9-Shangombo area (41%).   For  all zones, the 
remaining  household  food  requirements  came  from  additional  sources  of  cereals/tubers  and  other 
foods  eg  vegetables,  fish,  milk,  forest  products  (roots,  fruits,  nuts,  game),  meat,  oil.      An  important 
additional source of cereals/tubers was exchange.  Two types of exchange are common: exchange of 
labour for food: mealie meal, grain or cassava or barter/exchange of goods for food eg in the Gwembe 
valley  (11)  and  Kazungula/Sesheke  (7a)  households  exchanged  livestock,  sour  milk  and  fish  for 
cereals.     
 
Income  sources  used  to  purchase  these  additional  foods  varied  between  livelihood  zones  but  came 
from  a  combination  of:  sale  of  crops  (maize/cassava/  vegetables/cotton/tobacco),  livestock,  poultry, 
traditional opaque beer, and forest products/game; cross-border trade/petty trade; self-employment (eg 
production  and  sale  of  handicrafts,  grass,  timber,  charcoal);  employment  (eg  mining,  commercial 
farms/fishing); casual labour and exchange of labour, livestock, forest products, fish for food.    These 
sources of income have been developed over several years and were not specifically as a result of the 
drought.  Coping strategies adopted by household were generally limited to changing food intake (eg 
replacing nshima with other foods).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                
15 The main sources of cereals/tubers identified by the survey included: production of maize, sorghum, millet, rice from the 
2001/2 April harvest (after cereal sales and gifts have been deducted) including the winter maize harvest and green maize 
consumption; other direct sources including: cereal given in payment for casual labour; cereal purchased with money 
received as remittances; gifts of cereal; purchases of cereal and cereal/beans received as relief food; sweet potato and 
cassava production/consumption. 
16 2100 kilocalories is the mean population requirement for energy intake.  It is recommended that staples (cereals/tubers) 
should provide about 70% of kilocalories (eg 400g of cereals/person/day) with the rest of kilocalories coming from protein 
and fats (see Sphere standards).  1kg of cereal flour provides an equivalent kilocalorie intake as 2.4kg of cassava tuber or 
1.1kg of cassava flour.

requirements  of  2100  kcals/person/day.    In  both  zones,  other  sources  of  food  and  income  were 
considerably  more  important  than  own  crop  production  (cereal,  pumpkins,  vegetables),  which 
provided  less  than  25%  of  food  intake  last  year.    Purchase/exchange/barter  and  labour  exchange 
provided  50%  of  kilocalories  for  both  the  poor  and  middle  wealth  groups.    In  Kazungula/Sesheke 
many  poor  households  would  exchange  their  labour  for  food.    Households  would  also  travel  to 
neighbouring areas to exchange sour milk, fish and livestock for maize.   Forest products contributed 
to food intake in both zones but were particularly important in Kazungula/Sesheke zone (7a) where the 
variety of  fruits, roots and nuts18  ensured  year  round access.   Food relief over the 12 months under 
discussion, provided between 1-5% of kilocalories in Kazungula/Sesheke (7a) and 8-15% of kcals in 
Gwembe  valley  (11)  (see  discussions  on  food  relief  below).  The  prevalence  of  wasting  for  under  5 
years  children in Shangombo (9) has been stable  and acceptable between  April and November 2002 
(see figure 2.5) where as the energy requirements covered by carbohydrates are low (figure 3.1).

Livestock  census data suggests that herd sizes are  recovering  from the outbreak of East Coast Fever 
(Corridor)  in  1999  and  mortality  rates  in  livestock  have  reduced  since  then.  Employment  in  the 
Gwembe  valley  includes:  commercial  horticultural  production  (Agriflora),  commercial  kapenta 
fishing,  crocodile  farming  gemstone  and  coal  mining  (e.g.  Maamba  and  Mapatizya  mine,  Kalomo), 
Nakambala  sugar  company,  NGOs  (about  10)  and  the  civil  service.    In  Kazungula/Sesheke,  some 
                                                
18 Mungongo oil was an important source of food and income for the poor.  The oil is so popular that 1 litre of local 
mungongo costs ZMK 3000/litre and is only marginally cheaper than imported oil which sells for ZMK 3500/litre

in 

this  group 

people go to Namibia to work on commercial farms, as domestic workers or animal herders.  Informal 
cross-border trade  with Namibia includes sale/exchange of  forest products (fruits, timber, reeds)  and 
livestock for a variety of groceries.  Self-employment in both zones includes fishing, handicrafts, and 
selling  forest  products.    Vegetable  production  has  also  expanded  in  recent  years  particularly  in 
Gwembe  valley.  The  produce  is  marketed  in  Choma.  An  international  company  (Dunavant  cotton) 
supports a number of cotton out grower schemes in this zone. 
 
B)  Maize Consuming – Droughts less Frequent.  
  
Zones 
include  Chipata/Chadiza  area  (5b),  Southern  Province  Plateau  (5a), 
Chama/Lundazi  (4b), Chongwe area (7b) Kafue  Flats(4a), Mkushi Farming Block(13).  These zones 
are  found  in  the  east  and  the  centre  of  the  country.    This  is  the  centre  of  commercial  agricultural 
production and processing (coffee, tobacco, sugar, paprika, cotton, vegetables and flowers) in Zambia 
– where many households depend on agricultural labour.   
 
C)  Mixed Cassava/Cereal Consuming Zones and Cassava Consuming Zones 
 
Mixed cassava/cereal zones include: Copperbelt and Solwezi(2a), Northern Province (2b), Muchinga 
Escarpment(3b),  Kasempa/Mufumbwe(3a).    In  these  zones,  households  grow  and  consume  both 
cassava and maize.   Cassava consuming zones include: Zambezi/Chavuma(10), Luapula Region(1b), 
Kalabo  area(Barotse  Plains)  (8)  and  Kaoma/Mongu(6),  Mwinilunga/Kabompo(1a).    In  these  zones, 
households  focus  on  cassava  production  and  can  meet  most  of  their  energy  requirements  from  own 
crop production (both cassava and maize)- see Figure 3.3. 
 
Cereal  production  in  2002  in  these  areas  was  not  affected  by  drought.    Sources  of  income  in  these 
zones include sale of cereals, sale of tubers; casual labour particularly in zones Kasempa/Mufumbwe 
(3a)  and  Muchinga  Escarpment  (3b);  cross  border  trade  with  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo  in 
zones  Mwinilunga/Kabompo(1a),  Copperbelt  and  Solwezi(2a)  and  with  Tanzania  in  Northern 
Province (2b); with the  exception of Kalabo area(Barotse Plains) (8) where  flooding is common and 
cattle sales important, livestock did not make a significant contribution to diets.  
 
 Likewise,  food  relief  contributed  <5%  of  the  required  energy  intake.    In  the  central  areas 
Kasempa/Mufumbwe (3a) and Muchinga Escarpment (3b) game meat provides an additional source of 
food and income.

Food  economy  information  found  that  in  these  zones,  households  could  generally  access  2100 
kilocalories  or  more.    Own  crop  production  (including  cassava,  maize,  sweet  potatoes,  groundnuts, 
pumpkins  and  beans  made  a  significant  contribution  to  food  intake  in  these  zones:  28%-80% 
depending on zone and wealth group.  The poor in Mwinilunga/Kabompo (1a) were more dependent 
on  purchase  (49%)  than  own  production  (35%)  as  they  had  limited  access  to  draught  power  which 
resulted  in  smaller  areas  cultivated.    Whilst  in  Zambezi/Chavuma(10)  as  one  moved  up  the  wealth 
groups – households switched to cultivating maize as a cash crop and purchasing cassava for their own 
consumption – so own crop production made up a smaller proportion of intake (28%) whilst purchase 
was  more  important  (45%).      Cassava  is  consumed  in  all  households  and  makes  a  significant 
contribution to food intake.  For example in Northern Province (2b), poor households accessed cassava 
through:  production  (50%),  purchase  (7%)  and  exchange  (13%).    The  middle  and  better-off 
households  tend  to  mix  cassava  with  maize  throughout  the  year,  whilst  the  poor  wealth  groups  may 
mix  cassava with  maize or  millet during the harvest period.  Milk/meat  made a small but significant 
contribution to diets in Northern Province but were less important in other zones. 

 

Zones bordering Tanzania and DRC benefited from cross-border trade, particularly Northern Province 
(2b).  Other sources of income included agricultural labour: clearing and burning (chitemene), making 
mounds for cassava or ridges for sweet potatoes, preparing land in 'permanent' fields for maize 
production, planting, weeding and harvesting. Labourers negotiate specific terms with their employers, 
the middle and better off households within the zone. Some may be paid in kind, while others opt for

Coping strategies 

cash.  Payment is usually by area completed rather than a daily rate19.  Labour exchange was important 
for example in Luapula Region (1b), this was the main source of fish in the diet for poor households 
who were often paid 1 dish (2kg) of fish for 1 days work.   
 
3.2 
 
The assessment highlighted the diverse sources of income and food (see Appendix 5) that contributed 
to livelihoods in different zones within the country.  Some of these sources of food and income were 
specific to one or two zones, for example forest products (fruits, nuts) were most important in zones 
7a, 8 and 9; cross-border trade was particularly important in zones 1a, 1b, and 7a, 8.  Other sources of 
food/income  were  found  in  most  zones  (e.g.  agricultural  labour,  sale  of  poultry).  These  diverse 
economic  strategies  help  to  protect  people’s  livelihoods  and  reduce  the  impact  of  hazards  on  the 
household  (e.g.  as  a  response  to  frequent  droughts,  households  in  the  southern  parts  of  the  country 
have  diversified  into  vegetable  production,  livestock  trading.    Certain  of  these  livelihood  strategies 
will have a long-term negative impact on the environment unless appropriate controls are put in place 
e.g.  crop  production  using  the  slash  and  burn  farming  systems  (chitemene),  charcoal  production 
(Northern Province 2b), timber logging (Kazungula/Sesheke 7a), forest product collection (e.g. grass, 
reeds, game) and fishing (e.g. Luapula, 1b and Gwembe valley 11, Kasempa/Mufumbwe 3a). 
 
Within the questionnaire, coping strategies were grouped into: consumption, expenditure, income and 
migration  strategies.    Those  adopted  in  most  zones  focused  on  changes  in  consumption.    This 
included:  getting  food  from  other  sources,  changing  from  preferred  foods  to  less  expensive  foods, 
reducing  the  number  of  nshima  meals  per  day  and  sometimes  not  eating  nshima,  and  eating  only 
vegetables.  The  least  common  strategies  were  borrowing  food/money  to  buy  food,  relying  on  the 
consumption  of  wild  foods  in  zone  (9),  relying  on  own  catches  of  fish  in  zone  10  and  reducing 
expenditure on  fertiliser  and pesticides Mkushi Farm Block  (13) a less drought  affected zone.    The 
fact  that  expenditure,  income  and  migration  coping  strategies  were  adopted  by  a  limited  number  of 
households  highlights  the  number  of  existing  economic  strategies  in  many  parts  of  the  country  that 
enable  most  households  to  meet  their  basic  needs.    It  should  however  be  realised  that  some  coping 
strategies  are  undesirable  (eg  school  dropouts20.)  Zones  that  reported  the  highest  number  of  coping 
strategies were zone 11 and zone 7a.  In some zones (zones 11, 12a, 5a, 7a) – food aid did contribute 
up to 15-35% of kcal requirements over a 6-9 month period.  See discussion below.   
 
3.3  Hazards and Vulnerability 
 
Hazards  that  different  zones  face  vary.    In  the  southern  maize  producing  areas  –  whilst  drought 
threatens  maize  production,  these  areas  would  be  as  affected  if  not  more  affected  by  hazards  that 
impacted  on  their  vegetable  production  during  the  dry  season,  reduced  their  access  to  labour  or 
impacted  on  livestock.    Several  areas  in  the  south  also  face  irregular  flooding  (e.g.  Gwembe).    In 
cassava  growing  areas  –  potential  hazards  include  cassava  disease  (e.g.  mosaic  virus)  and 
deforestation.  In cross-border areas – trade restrictions would increase the level of vulnerability.   
 

                                                
19 The standard payment to clear 1lima (0.25 Ha) was K15000, regardless of the number of people working or the length of 
time taken to complete the task. 
20 10% of households surveyed reported children dropping out of primary school in 2002 – however figures are not 
available at present on usual drop out rates. 

 

21

The  most vulnerable in  each zone to these hazards would be the very poor.  These  were households 
who had less livestock (e.g. few chicken, no cattle), and cultivated less land (e.g. 1-2 Lima) and often 
only had labour.  Annual incomes ranged from less than 100,000 to over 500,000/year.  Definitions of 
very  poor  depend  upon  the  zone.    Sometimes  land  cultivation  was  limited  by  the  need  to  earn 
money/food  to  meet  the  households  daily  requirements.      Two  types  of  very  poor  households  were 
identified: labour poor households and households with labour21.  Labour poor households, were those 
with  almost  no  labour:  female  headed  households  and/or  elderly  couples  both  looking  after  young 
children/orphans  who  were  too  young  to  contribute  to  the  household  food  or  income  generation.  
These  households  relied  more  on  the  sale  of  chickens  and  a  few  cultivated  crops  for  survival, 
prostitution was also reported. Very poor household with labour, albeit limited, would have somebody 
capable  of  working  for  others  either  fishing  or  doing  agricultural  labour  for  middle  or  better  off 
households.  The  type  of  labour  available  to  very  poor  households  will  influence  the  type  of  income 
support programmes that would be appropriate.   
 
The  food  economy  assessments  highlighted  the  fact  that  maize  producing  areas  which  have  been 
regularly  drought/flood  affected  have  diversified  in  recent  years  away  from  maize  production  into 
other sources of food and income (e.g. labour, vegetable production and livestock sales).  This implies 
that vulnerability assessments need to go beyond crop assessments to include a review of livestock and 
other  sources  of  food/income.    Chronic  vulnerability  as  identified  by  nutrition  status  data  (stunting) 
suggests that households more at risk of chronic malnutrition are in fact those in the north rather than 
in the south of the country. 
 
3.4 
 
The August and December VAC assessments identified 46 districts that would require approximately 
224,200 MT of food relief for a maximum of 2,896,000 people between September 02 and March 
0322.  However, less than 60% of this was sourced and distributed.  Following initial delays in the 
arrival of the food relief, further geographical targeting was conducted, with some districts in the 
south, central and eastern zones (4a, 4b, 5a, 5b, 7a, 11, 12a) being prioritised for earlier distributions. 
As more food relief arrived towards the end of the year, distributions were expanded to include more 
of the original 46 districts.   
 
The  increase  in  distributions  (both  in  terms  of  coverage  and  quantities)  towards  the  end  of  the  year 
may  have  enabled  farmers  to:  concentrate  on  weeding  their  own  fields  during  the  cultivation  period 
(November  –  February)  rather  than  looking  for  work  elsewhere;  to  conserve  their  maize  rather  than 
harvesting  it  too  early.    In  addition,  in  some  districts  distributions  also  appear  to  have  occurred  just 
before the planting season (eg Sinazongwe).  This may have enabled farmers to cultivate large areas.  
 
The  contribution  of  food  relief  to  individual  households  varied  by  district  and  depended  on  the 
quantities  of  food  distributed  and  the  targeting  methodology  adopted.    Primary  data  from  the 
household questionnaire shows that the percentage of households targeted in each zone ranged from 7-
100% and that if households received all of this food relief in a 3 – 6 month period, it would contribute 
between 6 and 69% of energy requirements (see example in Figure 3.4).

The contribution of relief was most significant in the following zones: 11, 12a, 12b, 7b where most 
households (80-100%) assessed reported receiving food relief.  Secondary data suggests that this food 
was in fact received over a 6 – 9 month period and would have provided between 10 and 35% of 
kilocalories/person over 6 months23 (see Table 3.1).

3.5    Food Aid Targeting 
 
According to the last experience, WFP/DMMU would supply implementing partners with relief; this is 
illustrated  in  Figure  3.5.    The  implementing  partners  would  distribute  the  food  through  satellite 
committees  with  assistance  from  the  District  Disaster  Management  Committee24.    The  communities 
with support from the implementing partners were supposed to identify the beneficiaries.

Data suggests that in some districts – food tended to be distributed to all households rather than full 
rations being targeted to the most vulnerable.  In other zones/districts – food was targeted within the 
district – but the absolute quantities of food received per person were low.

FINDINGS ON RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FOOD INSECURITY, HIV/AIDS,   
HEALTH, EDUCATION, CHILD PROTECTION, WATER AND SANITATION 

Demographic and Health Characteristics 

 
4.1 
 
Table 4.1 shows the main demographic and health characteristics of the household population included 
in the 2003 Zambia VAC. The youthful nature of the rural Zambian population is noteworthy (49 % of 
the population is younger than 15 years old). The mean household size of 6.5 indicates that the rural 
population live in relatively large households. The crude mortality rate of more than 50 per 1000 of the 
population  aged  15-59  is  extremely  high.  Recall  problems  and  data  collection  errors  may  have 
contributed  to  this.    The  high  mortality  may  also  reflect  persons  returning  from  urban  areas  to  their 
rural homes after becoming ill and dying there.

The Relationship between HIV/AIDS and Food Security 

 
 
4.2 
 
HIV/AIDS can no longer be considered solely as a health problem; and efforts are needed to address 
its  social,  economic  and  institutional  consequences.  The  HIV/AIDS  epidemic  has  an  impact  on 
nutrition, food security, agricultural production and rural economies in many countries. All dimensions 
of food security - availability, stability, access and use of food - are affected where the prevalence of 
HIV/AIDS  is  high.  IFAD  has  suggested  that  the  HIV  epidemic  is  disproportionately  affecting 
agriculture  relative  to  other  sectors  (2001).  In  agrarian  societies,  the  HIV/AIDS  epidemic  is 

 

26

intensifying  existing  labour  bottlenecks,  increasing  widespread  malnutrition;  proving  a  barrier  to 
traditional  mechanisms  of  support  during  calamities,  adding  to  the  problems  of  rural  women, 
especially  female-headed  farm  households  arising  from  gender  division  of  labour  and  land 
rights/resources, and deepening macroeconomic crises by reducing agricultural exports. De Waal and 
Tumushabe  argue that this is not because  rates of HIV are higher among  workers in the agricultural 
sector, both commercial and small-scale subsistence, than  elsewhere but because the structure of the 
agricultural sector, especially the smallholder sub-sector, is such that it is much less able to absorb the 
impacts of the human resource losses associated with the epidemic (2003).  
 
The potential impact of HIV/AIDS on agriculture may include: 
 

  A decrease in the area of land under cultivation at the household level (due to a lack of labour 

stemming from illness and death among household members). 

  A decline in crop yields, due to delays in carrying out certain agricultural interventions such as 

weeding and other inter-cultivation measures as well as cropping patterns.  

  Declining yields may also result from the lack of sufficient inputs, e.g. fertilizer and seeds.  
  A reduction in the range of crops produced at the household level. 
  A loss of agricultural knowledge and farm management skills, due to the loss of key household 

members due to AIDS. 

  Decline in livestock production as the need for cash and the loss of knowledge and skills may 

force some families to sell their animals. 

 
De  Waal  and  Tumushabe  have  argued  that  HIV/AIDS  is  creating  the  ‘new  variant  famine’  that  has 
recently struck southern Africa. It operates through the epidemic in combination with drought and the 
food crisis. This argument is currently gaining adherents in contemporary debates around HIV/AIDS 
and  food  security.  The  ‘new  variant  famine’  hypothesis  posits  that  southern  Africa  is  facing  a  new 
kind of acute food crisis in which there is no expectation of a return to either sustainable livelihoods or 
a demographic equilibrium. It is important to recognise this position although questions remain about 
various elements of the debate. 
 
In  southern  Zambia,  Waller  conducted  a  small-scale  study  (32  households)  in  the  Monze  district  to 
investigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on farming. One observation of the study was that in households 
with sick persons, many of these individuals were coming from other districts. The study also pointed 
to  the  change  in  household  composition  due  to  an  aging  process  within  households  as  productive 
members  die  (the  so-called  granny  households).  One  key  observation  was  the  time  allocated  to  care 
giving. The study showed the differential vulnerability between the wealthier and larger household and 
the poorer and smaller ones. Also observed was the fact that the more wealthy households were taking 
in the most orphans.  
 
4.3 
 
This  section  seeks  to  identify  the  possible  links  between  HIV/AIDS  and  the  multiple  elements  of  a 
household food security strategy (agricultural production, income, non-agricultural multiple livelihood 
strategies).  It  should  be  noted  that  a  typical  VAC  survey  was  not  designed  to  explore  HIV/AIDS 
related issues.  Therefore, no direct HIV/AIDS related data is collected. In addition, there is a complex 

HIV/AIDS Field Data Analysis

inter-relationship  between  HIV/AIDS,  food  security,  poverty,  climatic  conditions,  macro-economic 
conditions and the resultant general vulnerability of rural households.  
 
To  describe  the  relationship  between  HIV/AIDS  and  food  security,  the  SADC  FANR  VAC  (2003) 
sought to detect associations between proxy indicators of HIV/AIDS and measures of household food 
security. In  essence, the approach  was to  compare households affected by HIV/AIDS (see the proxy 
variables  Appendix  6)  with  those  households  not  affected  by  HIV/AIDS  in  terms  of  food  security 
outcomes.  A  similar  approach  is  used  in  this  section.  The  proxy  indicators  used  in  this  analysis  are 
listed in Table 4.2. 
 
The analysis in this section relate to the total sample, although broad food economy zones were also 
used  in  some  instances  to  enhance  understanding  of  a  particular  issue.  Analysis  by  province  and 
district  was  not  feasible  due  to  the  relatively  small  sample  sizes.  The  Zambian  VAC  survey  was 
targeted at the rural population. The rural part of Zambia has a lower HIV prevalence compared to the 
urban  areas  (11%  compared  to  23%)  and  hence  the  data  contained  a  relatively  small  number  of 
households falling into the proxy indicator categories.

4.3.1  HIV/AIDS and Food Production 
 
HIV/AIDS  not  only  affects  the  productivity  of  the  infected,  but  also  diverts  the  labour  of  the 
household  and  extended  family  away  from  other  productive  and  reproductive  activities,  as  other 
members have to take care of the sick. Savings are consumed. Assets are sold to help pay for medical 
expenses.  The  utilisation  of  agricultural  land  declines  as  inputs  become  unaffordable,  household 
labour supply is reduced and dissipating wealth makes hiring labour difficult.  
 
One  of  the  impacts  of  HIV/AIDS  on  agriculture  is  the  loss  of  productive  labour.  It  is  assumed  that 
households affected by HIV/AIDS would tend to leave land normally under production, uncultivated 
as a result of the shortage of labour within the household. In the household survey, respondents were 
asked whether they left land that was usually cultivated, uncultivated the last growing season. About 
63  %  of  responding  households  stated  that  land  was  left  uncultivated.  These  households  were  then 
asked what the reasons were for leaving land uncultivated. More than one reason could be given. The 
four  most  common  reasons  given  by  these  households  for  leaving  land  uncultivated  was  “Lack  of 
labour” (41 %), “Lack of money to hire labour” (33 %), “Unavailability of animal draught power” (33 
%) and “Lack of fertilizer” (29 %).  

 

28

 
To test whether HIV/AIDS affected households were more likely to cite labour constraints as a reason 
for  curtailing  the  amount  of  land  cultivated,  households  with  proxy  indicators  were  compared  to 
households  not  falling  in  these  categories.  The  results  of  the  analysis  are  contained  in  Figure  4.1. 
There was a significant difference between households who reported the death of a chronically ill adult 
and who stated a lack of labour as reason for limiting cultivated land (25 %) compared to households 
who did not lose an adult member and gave the same reason (13 %) (Chi-square=14.817, p=0.002). A 
significant difference was also observed between households where the head died of a chronic illness 
compared to households where this was not the case (77 % compared to 41 %). Households with no 
adult  member  were  also  significantly  more  likely  to  report  a  lack  of  labour  as  reason  for  non-
cultivation  than  households  with  a  low  dependency  ratio.  No  such  association  was  found  among 
households  reporting  a  chronic  illness  or  having  taken  in  orphans.    One  possible  reason  why 
households  with  orphans  from  other  households  did  not  mention  the  lack  of  labour  as  a  constraint 
could  be  that  orphans  are  required  to  fulfill  a  variety  of  duties  within  those  households  to  alleviate 
labour shortages. This possibility needs further investigation.  
 
To  partially  explain  the  association  between  the  death  of  an  adult  member  and  the  lack  of  labour  one  should 
take into account that the average planting time of this  years harvest was approximately 4- 6 months 
before the survey, and deaths were reported for a period of 12 months before the survey. Where deaths 
occurred in the early part of the 12 month period, this was not long before the planting season and it 
can be assumed that the shock of a death and its implications was still felt by the household at the time 
of the planting season. If the death occurred in the latter part of the 12-month period it can be assumed 
that the household had to take care of a serious ill person at about the time of the planting season. In 
fact, the death of an  adult  member (whether  chronically ill or not,)  was also significantly associated 
with giving “lack of labour” as a reason for non-cultivation of a part of the fields.   

 

A similar finding was made when analyzing answers to a question regarding the main limitation to the 
production of cereal the last growing seasons of the main limitation. However, when these questions 
were  analyzed  by  categorizing  the  sample  of  households  into  three  broad  wealth  rankings,  the 
expected differences remained, but without being significant. One problem that is encountered in such 
an analysis is the small number of cases in each cell.  
 
Due  to  increased  expenses  and  reduced  incomes,  it  is  reasoned  that  rural  households  affected  by 
HIV/AIDS will have less resources available for agricultural inputs (chemical fertilizer, seeds etc.). In 
the  Zambian VAC household survey households  with  a  chronically ill  adult  were significantly  more 
likely to indicate a lack of  fertilizer as a reason for leaving land usually  cultivated, uncultivated (see 
Figure  4.1  and  Appendix  7).  When  analyzed  by  broad  wealth  ranking,  the  significance  of  this 
association  disappeared.    No  other  major  differences  were  detected  between  the  affected  and  non-
affected households in terms of the lack of other in-puts as a reason for non-cultivation of land

Other options available to households under stress are to reduce expenditure on a variety of items. One 
such option is to reduce expenses on education. Of those households that absorbed orphans a 
significant proportion (31 %) reduced overall expenditure on education compared to18 % of 
households that had no orphans (Chi-square=58. 4, p=0). The reduction in expenditure seems to be as 
a result of removing children from school (see above).

4.3.5  Other “Coping Mechanisms” 
 
Households  with  chronically  ill  adults  were  more  likely  to  sell  livestock/poultry  (30%)  than  those 
without  chronically  ill  adults  (18%).  Another  coping  strategy  followed  by  slightly  more  households 
with  chronically  ill  adults  compared  to  households  without  chronically  ill  adults  was  to  reduce  the 
number of  “nshima  meals” eaten per day  (64% versus 55%, Chi-square=7.606, p=0.005). There  was 
also a slight tendency for households with a chronically ill adult to skip entire days without eating any 
“nshima meal” (59% compared to 45%, Chi-square =7.715, p=0.005). 
 
4.3.6   Conclusion 
 
As  expected,  those  households  who  were  directly  affected  by  HIV/AIDS25  were  more  likely  to  cite 
labour shortages within the household as an important issue compared to households not affected by 
HIV/AIDS.  The  same  applies  to  a  variety  of  coping  strategies.  These  responses  were  signs  of 
households under stress.   
 
However, in terms of a  reduction in the amount  of  food produced or differences in  food production, 
the  data  of  the  Zambian  VAC  survey  on  the  whole  showed  no  real  differences  between  households 
categorized by the presence of one of the proxy variables and households not affected by HIV/AIDS. 
One  possible  reason  could  be  that  the  measures  of  food  production  collected  in  the  VAC  were 
inappropriate for this purpose. There was also a lack of other pertinent information. For instance, crop 
production  is  partly  dependent  on  the  area  cultivated,  (at  present  and  in  the  past),  a  measure  not 
collected  in  the  VAC.  Other  factors  that  have  an  effect  on  food  production  include  the  economic 
position  of  individual  households  and  the  characteristics  of  the  members  of  the  household.  For 
instance  educational  attainment  may  be  an  important  factor  in  mitigating  the  effect  of  HIV/AIDS. 
However, the VAC household survey did not  collect such detailed information. The same applies to 
the productive activities of household  members. The inability to include these and other  factors  may

mask  the  specific  impacts  of  HIV/AIDS  at  the  individual  household  level.  Another  important  factor 
that may have masked possible differences was the favourable climatic conditions during the past year 
in most of Zambia. This allowed a general increase in yields compared to last season. 
 
This  does  not  imply  that  individual  households  affected  by  HIV/AIDS  are  food  secure  or  “coping”. 
Targeted food aid strategies will do much to lessen the plight of such households. In addition, efforts 
that emphasize conservation farming, including minimum tillage operations, the development of new 
labour  saving  technologies  (see  for  instance  the  Zam-wipe  weeder26)  and  the  development  of  new 
varieties  of  crops,  should  be  supported.  Such  efforts  will  mitigate  the  impact  of  HIV/AIDS  in  rural 
areas by assisting households affected by HIV/AIDS to become more food secure.  
 
At  the  national  level,  higher  rainfall  figures  this  season  resulted  in  better  harvests  and  led  to  an 
improved food security situation among most rural households in Zambia. The food economy analysis 
conducted during this VAC emphasized the wide range of strategies followed by households to satisfy 
food requirements. The  findings of the  Zambian  VAC  failed to provide hard  evidence to support the 
notion  of  “the  new  variant  famine”  operating  in  the  country.  It  would  appear  if  climatic  conditions, 
food  pricing  policies,  the  lack  of  agricultural  support  and  extension  services,  environmental 
degradation,  a  lack  of  infrastructure  and  poverty  play  a  larger  role  in  inadequate  harvests  than 
HIV/AIDS. However, the  epidemic  may  compound  matters during an  environmentally induced  food 
shortage, such as what happened the previous season. 
 
Whether the same can be said of countries with significantly higher HIV prevalence rates than those 
found in the rural areas of Zambia (11 % of adults), remains unclear. 
 
4.3.7  Recommendation 
 
This  analysis  is  a  tentative  attempt  to  investigate  the  link  between  HIV/AIDS  and  food  security  in 
Zambia  and  should  be  followed  up  by  a  more  in-depth  analysis,  e.g.  a  multi-variant  analysis  to 
disentangle the complex relationships between poverty, food security and HIV/AIDS.  Unfortunately, 
the range of available data limits such an approach. 
 
Given  the  primary  goal  of  a  VAC  survey,  it  is  not  feasible  to  extend  the  focus  of  a  VAC  survey  to 
include  a  multitude  of  elements  that  may  be  used  to  investigate  the  impact  of  HIV/AIDS  at  the 
household  level.  One  alternative  would  be  to  conduct  a  more  intensive  study  looking  at  food 
production  and  food  security  issues  among  a  smaller  sample  of  households,  including  both  affected 
and  non-affected  households.  Another  alternative  would  be  to  visit  the  same  households  in  repeated 
VAC surveys. A longitudinal approach would provide an important time element, which should assist 
in answering many intriguing questions.    
 
4.4  Water 
 
Improved access to  clean  water particularly in drought-affected areas is having a positive impact  on 
water  related  diseases  such  as  cholera,  dysentery,  the  incidence  of  which  has  reduced  in  the  last  5 
years.  Cholera officially first recorded in 197927, became endemic with the highest fatalities reported

in  1991/2.    In  the  last  5  years,  the  incidence  of  cholera  has  decreased  from  a  recent  high  of  11,615 
cases (337 deaths) in 1999 to 587 cases (15 deaths) in 2002.  Likewise, although prevalence’s are still 
high in Southern province (13 per 1000 population in 2002) dysentery outbreaks have been declining 
in all provinces since 2000 particularly in Western and Eastern Province.  Northern Province recorded 
the  lowest  incidents  in  this  period  with  general  incident  trends  declining  over  the  last  three  years.  
However,  non-bloody  diarrhoea  has  increased  in  the  last  3  years.    The  highest  incidences  of  non-
bloody diarrhoea  were  reported in Lusaka  followed by the Copperbelt, but the highest  case  fatalities 
reported in Southern Province and the Copperbelt.

NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY: OUTLOOK FOR 2003-04 MARKETING YEAR  

5.0 
 
5.1 
 
Maize  production  particularly  increased  from  601,606MT  to  1,207,202  MT  (81%)  (see  Table  5.1). 
compared  to  the  previous  season.  This  increase  is  attributed  to  the  generally  favourable  weather 
pattern in most parts of the country except for a few pockets in the south of the country. Another factor 
contributing  to  the  increase  is  the  input  subsidy  programme  for  small-scale  farmers  introduced  by 
Government and the  favourable  maize prices that obtained towards the  end of last  year. Commercial 
farmers  contributed 412,381 MT  (36%) of the total  maize production  with the balance  coming  from 
small and medium scale farmers. Most of the traditional maize growing areas28 recorded an increase in 
production of over 100% compared to the last season. This was accompanied by an overall increase in 
area planted to maize of 22%. However; low increases and/or a reduction in production were recorded 
in  eastern  province.  This  can  be  attributed  to  diversification  by  farmers  into  the  production  of  high 
value crops such as cotton and tobacco (out- grower schemes).  
 
Sorghum recorded a marginal increase of 21% attributed to the long-term effects of drought that has 
had an adverse impact on maize production. A marked increase in local beer brewing could be another 
factor.  Although  overall  production  of  millet  declined  by  6  percent,  significant  increases  were 
recorded  in  Mambwe,  Chilubi,  Sesheke,    Samfya  as  well  as  most  drought  prone29  areas.  Rice 
production  declined  by  8  percent.  However,  in  Northern  Province  rice  production  increased  100 
percent. 
 
Cassava production has increased by 15 percent country wide compared to last year. It is important to 
note  that  this  increase  is  also  prevalent  in  areas  that  are  not  traditional  cassava  growing  areas.  For 
instance,  production  in  Kapiri  Mposhi  and  Lundazi  increased  by  over  200%  and  180%  respectively 
compared to the previous year. The increase in non-traditional cassava areas is attributed to the Food 
Security  Pack  Programme  under  which  early  maturing  cassava  varieties  have  been  distributed  to 
small-scale farmers over the last three years. 
 
The above scenario indicates that the  food security situation in terms of  cereal and tuber availability 
has improved tremendously over the previous  year. Cassava has continued to contribute significantly 
to food availability. Sorghum, millet and rice production continue to provide marginal contribution.

Stocks expected to be held by commodity traders, millers, FRA and commercial farmers as at May 2003, NOT including stocks held by 
small-scale farmers in rural areas. 
Production estimates from MACO/CSO. Cassava production is based on the total area under cassava, using an annual yield figure 
of 11.7 tonnes per hectare (MAFF Root and Tuber Improvement Programme, 1996). A flour extraction rate of 25% is used. Other tubers 
are sweet potatoes and Irish potatoes. 
Urban production of maize is estimated at 6.61% of rural smallholder production, based on 1998 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey's 
urban respondents who cultivated one hectare of maize or less. 
Staple foods are assumed to represent 70% (1,421 kCal/person/day) of total diet (2,030 kCal/person/day), converted to crop requirements 
for the national 2003/04 population of 10.11 million people. The maize grain and cassava meal surplus represents an overall surplus of 
staple foods. Cross-substitution may make this surplus partly available in the form of other crops. 

Locally purchased FRA stocks expected to be carried over into the next season.(this does not indicate total FRA purchases on the local 
market nor imports) 
Estimated requirements by major stockfeed producers. 

Estimated requirements by industrial breweries. 

Estimated seed crop grown for seed companies. 

Post harvest losses are estimated at 5% for grains and sweet potatoes, and 2% for cassava. 

Expected surplusses or deficits that arise after meeting minimum overall staple human consumption requirements as well as industrial 
requirements. Cassava and maize surpluses may be substitutable with other crops and may result in different exportable volumes than the 
ones indicated here.The rice deficit is based on what is known to be imported each year, as indicated under D.The wheat deficit is based 
on the estimated market size as indicated in B, less availability as indicated in A. 

Imports required to be made by the private sector to meet the commercial market demands. 

Total estimated requirement for food relief among vulnerable groups, to be imported. This could be met with maize or other grains. 

 

35

The 2002-03 final crop forecast estimates the seasonal cereal production for the 2003-04 consumption 
year  to  be  1,224,236  MT  of  which  1,157,861MT  is  maize;  20,301  MT  Sorghum;  35,331  MT  Millet 
and 10,744 MT Rice. (Wheat has not been included in the analysis for VAC purposes because it is a 
non-staple). The Balance sheet further indicates a marginal surplus of 120,000 MT of maize and that 
of cassava of 376,191MT. The rest of the cereal staples will be in deficit. It is important to note that 
the  surplus  or  deficit  levels  will  be  influenced  by  competing  requirements  such  as  human 
consumption, reserve requirements, stock feeds, breweries, seed and cross border trade (export).  
 
Despite the improved cereal and cassava production situation in the country, some areas like Chama, 
Katete,  Petauke,  Mwense,  Chinsali,  Luwingu,  Kabompo  and  Senanga  have  experienced  an  overall 
reduction in cereal and tuber availability ranging between 20% and 40% reduction, but still produced 
sufficient  to  meet  their  basic  energy  requirements.  However,  it  is  worth  noting  that  the  situation  in 
Chama,  Katete  and  Petauke  can  mainly  be  attributed  to  cotton  and  tobacco  contract  farming  (high 
value  crops) whereas that in Mwense  can be attributed to the  move  from  crop production to  fishing. 
The  situation  in  the  remaining  districts  can  be  attributed  to  the  dry  spells  experienced  during  the 
season. 
 
The  above  factors  do  not  favor  continued  maize  imports  by  Government.  Generally  there  should  be 
downsizing  on  importation  of  both  relief  and  commercial  maize  supplies  to  allow  the  market  to 
function.  When  mitigating  the  factors  mentioned  above  Government  should  work  towards  avoiding 
market failure (Loss of confidence) vis-à-vis timely imports and exports of maize.  
 
5.2 
 
As  of  28  May  2003,  available  information  on  cereal  stocks  indicates  that  the  Food  Reserve  Agency 
had  41,000  MT  of  maize  as  strategic  reserves  with  an  additional  20,000  MT  held  on  behalf  of  the 
Office  of  the  Vice  President  (DMMU).  The  DMMU  also  had  in  stock  13,700  MT  of  grain  which 
included 7,000 MT of winter maize and 5,500 MT of food aid rice.  
 
On May 16th the Government announced the  maize  floor price in rural areas at K30, 000/ 50Kg bag 
(~US$122/MT)  in  order  to  protect  small-scale  farmers  from  traders  trying  to  pay  unfair  prices.  
However, the floor price may impact negatively on the commercial farmers as they will not be able to 
sell  their  maize  crop  immediately  at  competitive  prices.  Overall,  the  floor  price  will  only  yield 
desirable  results  if  sufficient  funds  are  immediately  released  to  FRA  to  start  buying  maize  from 
outlying  areas  and  moderate  supply  in  order  to  allow  the  market  to  function  normally.  Otherwise, 
commercial farmers will lobby for a lifting of the export ban to enable them seek import parity prices. 
This will have its own consequences on the local availability of grain.  
 
5.3 

Current Maize Availability and Access  

Agricultural Inputs  

In 2002, the Government initiated a Fertilizer Support Programme (FSP) meant to improve access to 
farm inputs for small-scale farmers by providing subsidized seed and fertilizer and thereby increasing 
household buying power. In order to qualify for receipt of inputs, cooperatives had to pay only 50% of 
the  cost  of  inputs.  This  program  was  important  since  seed  retention  among  small-scale  farmers  had 
become very low following two consecutive years of poor harvest.  

 

36

The  FSP  distributed  almost  100%  of  the  fertilizer  targeted  under  the  programme  whilst  out  of  the 
2,400  MT  of  seed  intended  for  delivery,  only  60  percent,  or  1,439.45  MT  was  actually  supplied  to 
farmers. With the exception of Eastern and Western provinces, provincial and district centers received 
at least 60 percent of the intended quantities of seed.  North Western, Central and Luapula all received 
over 80 percent of their allocated seed.  However, many farmers reported delays in the distribution of 
inputs and reported receiving inputs rather late. 

According to the findings of the survey, in general, better off households had more access to seed and 
fertilizer  for  crop  production  compared  to  very  poor/poor  households  (see  Figure  5.1).  In  addition 
some farmers complained about being left out of the distribution list for inputs.

Based on survey results, the major reason for land being left uncultivated by most farmers was ‘lack of 
household labour’ followed by ‘lack of seed’. Of the very poor/poor households, 45 % of households 
leaving land uncultivated was due to ‘lack of  household labour’ and 42% due to ‘lack of seed’, while 
for the better off it was 36% and 29 % respectively. 
 
The main reason identified in the survey for cereal seed inadequacy across wealth groups was ‘failure 
to purchase seed’. The survey found that 65% of the very poor/poor compared to 50% of the better off 
wealth group could not afford to purchase seed for cereal production. Most respondents also stated that 
they did not retain enough seed from the previous season.  
 
Across wealth groups the main reason cited for ‘lack of use of fertilizer’ was that it was not affordable 
despite  districts  reporting  having  received  fertilizer  for  distribution  under  the  FSP.  The  survey  also 
found  that  the  amount  of  fertiliser  reaching  the  household  level  was  low,  due  to  poor  road 
infrastructure and inadequate resources to meet the required down payment.

VULNARABLE AREAS AND TARGETING 

Analysis of Food Gap, Beneficiaries and Districts Affected 

6.0 
 
6.1 
 
The  analytical  basis  for  determining  the  cereal  gap  and  beneficiaries  that  is  based  on  the  underlining 
assumption that last year people met their kilocalorie/energy requirements.  The evidence for this being 
that most of the population did not adopt unusual detrimental coping strategies and the nutrition status 
data shows that levels of acute malnutrition did not increase over the year. 
 
Cereal Deficit 
 
To assess the cereal deficit this year – the analysis looked at what aspects of household’s economies had 
changed since last year that might impact on their ability to meet their requirements this year.  The main 
changes identified were: 
 

•  Crop production (cereal/cassava) had changed 
•  Food aid may not make a contribution to diets 
 

Source of Figures Used 
 

•  Crop  production  data  for  2002/03  season    (cereal  and  cassava)  from  MACO  annual  crop 

assessment 

•  Food  relief  distribution  data  on  quantities  sent  to  each  district  by  the  time  of  the  survey  and 
assumed to have been distributed to beneficiaries. Population data used was CSO data for 2003 
(9.8 million) in the rural areas based on the 2000 census.  The population in the urban areas was 
excluded from these calculations. 

 
Identification of Vulnerable Districts 
 

•  The urban populations were excluded. 
•  The contribution of this year’s production to kilocalorie intake was assessed.  All districts were 
reviewed  and  those  producing  less  than  1470  kilocalories/person/day  were  identified.    Those 
with less than 1470 kcals were then assessed in terms of whether crop production has  increased 
or decreased this year and the contribution of relief food to livelihoods in each district last year 

•  Districts  in  which  last  year’s  production  together  with  last  year’s  relief  food  contribution 

exceeded this year’s production were identified as needing assistance.   

•  Districts  in  which  last  year’s  production  together  with  last  year’s  relief  food  contribution  is 
marginally  lower  than  this  year’s  production  were  short  listed  for  future  monitoring  and 
contingency planning.  

 

Identification of Population in Need in each District 
  

•  Districts  in  which  last  year’s  production  together  with  last  year’s  relief  food  contribution 

exceeded this year’s production were identified. 

•  The  percentage  deficit/gap  in  kilocalories  as  a  percentage  of  1470  was  then  calculated  for  the 
whole district and then  converted into  full  rations.  VAC survey results had  estimated that the 

 

38

upper  limit  in  each  district  of  vulnerable  persons  was  15%  of  rural  population.  Based  on  this 
estimated the number of full rations gave the target population in each district.   

•  The higher of the two estimates was used as the figure for people in need in each district. 
•  A  similar  approach  was  used  for  populations  that  will  be  under  monitoring  and  contingency 

plans.  

•  Further,  a  worst  case  scenario  is  also  proposed  were  HIV  /  AIDS  district  prevalence  is 
incorporated  using  1999  data.  This  analysis  was  not  pursued  any  further  since  after  1999,  the 
district data  was aggregated into provincial data  and therefore difficult to know  with  certainty 
the current district profiles. However, the main recognition is that with HIV / AIDS there is an 
additional  cereal  requirement  of  350  Kilo  calories  per  day  implying  that  districts  with  high 
preference rates will have higher cereal thresholds. 

 

6.2        Districts and Populations with Cereal Deficit 
 
Table 6.1and Figure 6.1 shows the districts that will experience cereal deficit between May 2003 and 
April 2004 together with the affected population.  In addition, the required quantities and proposed time 
frame for distribution is also shown.

Total 
 
The total population that will need assistance between May 2003 and April 2004 is 59,939 or 0.06% of 
the population. A total of 1,369 MT of cereal is required for the targeted population in order to feel the 
existing cereal gaps in the target districts. Chama will require the most relief cereal food followed by 
Sinazongwe and Monze. The least requirement will be in Kazungula. Equally, based on the cereal gap, 
the most affected beneficiaries are in Chama, Luangwa and Sinazongwe. The least affected are Itezi 
Itezi, Monze and Kazungula.   
 
It is important to note that the proposed future rationing must be commensurate with the existing gap 
per household.  This is because it is assumed that the households have met part of the recommended 
400g per day ration and only require a top up from relief. For example, despite Monze having a large 
population in need, the ration requirement per person is nevertheless marginal. The proposed period 
for distribution is October to February 2004, a period which the survey determined as the leanest. 
 
 
 

 

39

*If  however,  it  is  decided  that  all  affected  persons  get  recommended  cereal  rations  (400  grams  of 
cereal per day) irrespective of the cereal gap then 3,600 MT will be required for assistance. (That is, 
400g x 60,000 people x 5months x 30 days/1000 to convert to kg/1000 to convert to MT = 3600 MT) 
 

Figure 6.1: Districts Requiring Future Food Assistance 2002-2003 

 

 

 
Whilst the  ration is suggesting general distribution, a provision needs to be  made  for supplementary 
feeding programs (for those who fall below an agreed economic criteria) to target special groups like;  
pregnant and lactating mothers, the elderly, chronically ill, and other specific nutritionally vulnerable.   
 
6.3     Districts and Populations Requiring Monitoring 
 
Table 6.2 shows the districts that will require monitoring between May and April 2004. Any 
contingency planning may be based on this population as they have a higher possibility of descending 
into food insecurity (see Figure 6.1).

For those districts requiring monitoring a contingency provision should be made to provide, at the most, 
a cereal ration of 400g per person per day for 5 months (October – February 2004). This translates into 
a cereal contingency of 2,375 MT. For these districts, it is recommended that rapid random assessments 
are made just before the onset of the lean period to determine their cereal availability and access status. 
 
6.4     Targeting 
 
It  is  recommended  that  the  most  vulnerable  should  be  identified  (using  a  combination  of  social  and 
economic  criteria).    Social  criteria  on  their  own  are  not  sufficient,  for  example,  it  is possible  to  have 
relatively wealthier widows or orphans in a community.   
 
Ideally targeting criteria should be developed for each district. In addition the Ministry of Community 
Development and Social Services Department of Social Welfare needs to start using the public welfare 
assistance  scheme  guidelines  which  were  developed  in  December  2000  to  assist  in  social  targeting. 
There is need for a tripartite meeting (Government, NGOs and community representatives) to agree by 
compromise on targeting guidelines for each district.  There is need to start putting emphasize on food 
for work as self-targeting mechanisms 
 
Those  responsible for  food distribution need to be actively guiding and assisting communities in the 
management of the targeting and distribution processes.  They need to be able to intervene to correct 
problems when they find them.  There is need for enough capacity to ensure that distribution lists are 
prepared  and  scrutinized  to  eliminate  duplicate  allocations.  In  addition,  there  is  need  for  people  to 
monitor distributions to make sure that distribution lists are being respected, that food rations are being 
distributed  in  the  right  amounts,  that  beneficiaries  are  not  being  charged  distribution  fees  (either  in 
cash  or  food),  and  that  beneficiary  selection  is  a  community  activity  not  left  to  a  few  elite  people.  
There is need to put in place a mechanism for community members to register complaints that result in 
action to ensure the distributions are reaching those who most need them.

RECOMMENDATIONS 

Short Term 

7.0 
 
7.1 
 
7.1.1  Relief 
 

•  Phase  out  of  free  food  relief  programmes  in  most  areas  except  in  districts  highlighted  in 
Chapter five where food should be targeted to the most vulnerable (defined by a combination 
of social and economic criteria) for up to 5 months during the hungry season. During free food 
relief phase-out, development interventions should be identified to target the most vulnerable; 
these could include FFW, CFW and livestock restocking as appropriate. The aim is to mitigate 
those  coping  strategies  that  are  detrimental  or  unsustainable,  such  as  depletion  of  livestock 
assets. 

•  FFW  should  be  linked  to  mid  term  community  development  (e.g.  the  food  for  asset 
programme).    Interventions  should  build  on  community  financial  capital  (e.g.  supplies  of 
credit, savings and  markets), physical  capital (e.g. roads), social  capital (e.g. social  resources 
(access  to  wider  institutions  of  society  and  networks)  upon  which  people  draw  in  pursuit  of 
livelihoods),  human  capital  (e.g.  good  heath,  education  and  other  important  skills/knowledge 
base) and natural capital (e.g. environmental resources, fishing, water and biodiversity).  

•  Procurement of any relief  food  must  first be done locally to  ensure that  market  confidence is 

 

 

maintained. 

 
7.1.2  Food Security and HIV/AIDS 
 

•  Strengthen  service  delivery  systems  for  HIV/AIDS  programmes  within  both  relief  and 
development.  These  will  need  to  be  rural  and  urban  specific  and  focus  on  information, 
education, and communication. 

 

 

 

 

•  Strengthen cross border initiative programmes.  

•  Strengthen programmes aimed at reducing stigmas and discrimination. 

•  Support Home Based Care programmes.  

•  Consideration  should  be  given  to  conduct  a  longitudinal  VAC|  survey,  targeting  those 
households affected by HIV/AIDS  (according to  the proxy indicators) on the one hand and  a 
similar group of households not affected by HIV/AIDS. This should provide the opportunity to 
collect  data  over  time,  to  compare  the  livelihood  strategies  of  both  groups.    Alternatively  a 
more  intensive  study  focusing  on  livelihood  strategies  of  households  affected  by  HIV/AIDS 
and how that impact on food security in general may be more appropriate.   

 
7.1.3  Agricultural Inputs 
 

•  Timely delivery of quality agricultural inputs especially at sub-district level. 

 

42

7.1.4  Targeting/Monitoring of Food Relief 
 

•  Joint  GRZ/UN/NGO  review  of  community  based  targeting  with  the  aim  of  producing  the 

following outcomes: 

•  A review of targeting guidelines; criteria for beneficiary selection and verification; guidelines 
for  use  of  community  based  structures  for  distribution;  clear  structures  for  monitoring  a) 
distribution  b)  post-distribution  and  c)  impact  and  guidelines  for  joint  monitoring  by 
organizations at each level: community, district and national level (bottom up). 

 
•  Re-orient  all  stakeholders  (Government,  NGOs,  community  leaders,  satellite  committees, 

DDMC [District Disaster Management Committees] on targeting guidelines. 

 

•  Evaluate the relief program and its management. 

 
 
7.1.5  Actions Requiring Follow Up:  

 
•  VAC should undertake a Livelihood Zone Mapping survey to rezone and update information. 

•  VAC must undertake a baseline survey of the identified zones. 

•  Future assessments should focus on looking at livelihoods (access to food and income) and not 

be limited to cereal production and rainfall.  

 
•  Development of baseline livelihood profiles across the country involving 1-2 district level staff 

as well as GRZ/NGO staff at the national level. 

•  Cross border trade studies of marketing (both formal and informal). 

•  District level staff to collect information for monitoring purposes once baseline is established.  

•  Need  to  collect/compile  secondary  data  for  the  past  5-10  years  &  technical  data  (crop 

production, livestock data, formal employment, prices, fishing etc.). 

•  Explore  the  links  between  food  economy,  on-going  monitoring  and  rapid  assessments 

including questionnaires. 

•  Look at methods that could be adopted to ensure availability of maize at fair price in marginal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maize producing areas. 

 
7.2  Mid/Long Term – Area Specific 
 

The dietary should be more diversified in the majority of livelihood zones in order to prevent 
nutritional deficiencies. 
 
  Livestock restocking programmes. 

 

43

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

•  Strengthen veterinary programmes.  The animal disease control program should be reviewed,   

with an aim to strengthening it in the South and extending it to the North-West and West. 

• 

• 

Improve extension services including introduction of early maturing cassava variety, millet, 
nuts, beans, peas, soya and development of fish farms. 

Improve fat availability by cultivating groundnuts, sunflower and planting of palm oil trees 
(e.g.: palm oil tree cultivation in Luapula province, with the support of FAO).  

•  Milk, which is an essential source of calcium, is deficient in all the zones: the consumption of 

goat milk should also be initiated as well as small fish like Kapenta.  

•  Develop co-operative initiatives including partnerships with the private sector. 

•  Revival of development initiatives (e.g.. irrigation, pineapple, honey) and enterprise 

development (e.g. mangongo/manketti oil).  Micro credit-small business loans and market 
development. 

• 

Improve food processing (fish, cassava and wild foods). 

•  Sensitisation to reasons for and implementation of the fish ban should be supported. 

•  Strengthen infrastructure (support to roads).

To identify households affected by HIV/AIDS an indirect approach was used. At the level of the household, HIV/AIDS  manifests through chronic illnesses of individuals and later death. By asking questions about morbidity and 
mortality, it was intended to obtain a measure of the prevalence of chronic morbidity in a household (excluding accidents etc), as well as deaths resulting from chronic illness. This information can be used as an indirect (or proxy) 
indication of the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in households. The following questions pertaining to chronic morbidity were asked in the Zambian VAC: 

Appendix  6: HIV/AIDs Proxy Indicators. 

 
a) 
b) 
 

Are there any adults (20-59 years) in the household who have been ill for more than 3 months during the past 12 months? 
Is the head of the household among those who have been ill for more than 3 months in the last 12 months). 

Mortality information was obtained by asking respondents the following questions: 
 

Has any adult  (20-59 years) died in the last year?  after being ill for more than 3 months? 

c) 
d)  Was the adult that died ill for more than 3 months? 
e)  Was the person that died after being ill for more than 3 months the head of the household?  
 

The  presence  of  orphans  in  the  household  and  the  absorption  of  orphans  from  other  households  are  a  direct  indication  of  parental  deaths  on  the  one  hand  and  the  dissolution  of  other  households  on  the  other.  To  obtain  such 
information, respondents in the Zambia VAC survey were asked the following question: 
 

f) 

Number of orphaned children (defined as “both parents lost” and “less than 15 years of age”) in the household who have come from other households. 

 
In addition, the questionnaire obtained information regarding the number of persons resident in the household, by specific age and sex categories.  
 
The information obtained in the VAC household survey  was used to  construct  a number  of indicators that  could serve  as  a proxy  for  “HIV/AIDS” (see Table  A1). These  proxies fall in two broad  categories namely  proxies  for 
individuals infected  by  HIV (see the morbidity  and  mortality indicators) and  affected households (all the indicators). It should be realized that  a household exhibiting  one of these proxy indicators is  not  necessarily  affected  by 
HIV/AIDS, but there is an increased likelihood that this may be the case.  
 
Brief discussion of the indicators 
 
Chronically ill adults  
The  Zambia VAC  survey results  show  that  a  chronically ill adult  was  present in  approximately 22  %  of the  households  covered in the survey.  In 44  %  of  households  with  a  chronically  ill  person(s), it  was  reported that the 
household head were among those persons. Given the present prevalence rates of HIV in Zambia, the morbidity rates are therefore not unexpected. However, it should be noted that Zambia has high prevalence rates of malaria and 
TB, to name just two illnesses.  Persons suffering from these diseases were included in the results. The presence of other diseases weakens this indicator somewhat as a proxy for HIV/AIDS. 
 
Mortality among adults  
According to the results of the survey an adult died in the last 12 months in about 12 % of the households covered in the survey. About seven-and-a-half percent of households reported the death of an adult after being chronically 
ill.  About 2 % of households lost a head due to death after a chronic illness in the last year. What should be taken into account is that according to accounts (see FEA field notes) of members of rural households who moved to 
urban areas, return to their original households when they become ill with AIDS related infections. On the one hand this increase morbidity rates (see above) with increased care responsibilities for the rural household, and on the 
other hand, increase mortality rates.  
 
Dependency ratios  
Changes in the age composition of households provide some evidence of the impact of HIV/AIDS. Since AIDS-related mortality is concentrated in the adult age groups, the ratio between adult and mostly younger members will 
change (i.e. the dependency ratio) having an impact on both the economic position of the household and on the ability of the household to care for its members. It has been argued that the dependency ratio is a suitable indicator to 
measure these impacts (De Waal  and Tumushabe,  2003). The dependency ratio is a  demographically determined indicator.  Apart  from the previously  mentioned impact  of  a  reduction in the  number  of  adults that increases the 
dependency ratio, the dependency ratio is largely influenced by the fertility rate of a population. Under conditions of high fertility, high dependency ratios are the norm. Although Zambia has been experiencing a decline in fertility, 
rates remain high (TFR of 4.9 children per woman). This high fertility will be reflected in high dependency ratios independent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Also, higher dependency ratios due to higher mortality rates among adults 
are partially offset by a reduction in the dependency ratio due to high mortality among young children (In Zambia the IMR is 95). Another factor that impacts upon the dependency ratio at a household level is the out-migration of 
members in the economic active ages to look for employment in the urban areas.  Results of the Zambia VAC survey show a dependency ratio skewed to the right as expected.  
 
Presence of orphans  
Results of the Zambia VAC indicate that in 18 % of households covered in the survey, there was an orphan(s) present that originated from another household. The presence of orphans may increase food insecurity and strain the 
financial position of the receiving household. However, in rural households, orphans, depending on their age, may function as a labour source offsetting labour shortages in the household. Other factors such as the socio-economic 
position and demographic characteristics of the host household are important. The crude proxy: “presence of orphans” cannot detect these important nuances, and this reduces its usefulness for the purpose of analysis.
