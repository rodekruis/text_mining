EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 
The  Zambia  Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee  (ZVAC)  undertook  the  In-Depth 

Vulnerability and Needs Assessment in seventeen (17) districts following reports of 

flooding  and/or  dry  spells.  The  assessment  report  has  proposed  recommendations 

necessary  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  floods  and  /or  dry  spells  in  the  affected 

districts. These recommendations have been translated into a Recovery Action Plan 

with specific activities and costing.  

 

The  Recovery  Action  Plan  is  divided  into  various  sections.  The  required  sector 

specific  interventions  and  costing  are  discussed  focusing  on  Education,  Health, 

Nutrition, Infrastructure, Human Settlement and Shelter, Water and Sanitation. 

 

It is important to note that recommended interventions reflect sector needs in short, 

medium and long-term perspectives. The financial requirements per sector are also 

discussed. 

The  summary  of  the  financial  requirements  per  sector  is  reflected  in  the  table 

below:

The  Implementation  of  the  action  plan  is  to  be  done  with  full  participation  of  all 

stakeholders  such  as  relevant  Government  agencies,  donors,  UN  System,  private 

sector  and  NGOs.  The  NGOs  in  conjunction  with  the  district  and  satellite  disaster 

management  committees  will  be  the  front  line  implementers  at  the  district  level. 

The  timeframe  for  the  implementation  of  interventions  is  projected  to  be  twelve 

(12) months beginning in August 2010. 

The Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Unit (DMMU)  will  spearhead  coordination 

and  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  action  plan  with  the  support  of  the 

core  coordination  team,  drawing  membership  from  Government,  UN,  and  NGO 

agencies. 

Monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  Recovery  Action  Plan  will  be  based  on  sector 

specific performance indicators that form part of this action plan document.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

The 2009/10 rainfall season was characterised by heavy rains in most parts of the 

country.  The  extreme  southern  parts  of  the  country  experienced  a late  start  while 

the rest of the country experienced normal start. Overall, most parts of the country 

received  normal  to  above  normal  rainfall  which  led  to  excessive  rains  that 

culminated  into  flash  flood  in  low  lying  areas  and  water  logging  in  plateau  areas. 

The  excessive  rainfall  experienced  resulted  into  varying  impacts  on  key  sectors  of 

the economic.  

 
Furthermore, following  reports  from  the  District Disaster  Management  Committees 

(DDMC)  on  negative  effects  the  floods  and/or  dry  spells,  the  Zambia  Vulnerability 

Assessment  Committee  (ZVAC)  undertook  an  in-depth  assessment  in  seventeen 

(17)  districts  in  Central,  Eastern,  Lusaka,  North  Western,  Southern  and  Western 

Provinces. 

 

To  ensure  a  speedy  and  coordinated  response,  the Government  of  the Republic  of 

Zambia  has  provided  a  general  framework  within  which  all  stakeholders  will 

undertake  all  interventions  related  to  floods.    The  plan  defines  the  scale  of  the 

problem  and  the  rationale 

for  the 

implementation  of  the  recommended 

interventions. It brings out the general response strategy and outlines sector based 

interventions  in  short  and  medium  to  long-term  perspectives.  Implementation, 

reporting, monitoring and coordination arrangements are also spelt out. 

 

2.0. SCALE OF THE PROBLEM 
 
The  country  has  in  the  recent  past  experienced  floods  which  have  resulted  in 

damage  to  Infrastructure  mainly  roads,  culverts  and  bridges  and  to  some  extent 

Crops.  These  floods  have  generally  exposed  the  affected  Population  to  the  risk  of 

outbreak  of  waterborne  diseases.  The  damage  to  crops  has  resulted  into  food 

insecurity  problems in  very  few  districts  despite  an increase in  production in most 

 

4 

of  the  sampled  districts.  In  order  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  floods  and/or  dry 

spells,  Government  will  need  to  implement  short  to  medium  and  long-term 

interventions in all the seven (7) sectors identified to have been affected.  

 

3.0. RATIONALE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDED 

      INTERVENTIONS 

 

In  order  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  the  floods  and/or  dry  spells,  the  Government 

should as a matter of urgency address the negative effects thereof by implementing 

sector specific interventions which range from short term needs to those that seek 

to  address  medium  to  long  term  needs.  The  interventions  will    help  mitigate 

negative effects in the identified sectors such as prevention of water borne diseases, 

maintain  economic  viability  and  reduce  if  not  prevent  increase  in  the  levels  of 

malnutrition  among  affected  communities  through  provision  of  relief.  The 

interventions will also help rehabilitate damaged infrastructure. 

 

4.0 GENERAL RESPONSE STRATEGY 

 

The governmentâ€™s strategy is to mobilize all available human, financial and material 

resources and redirect these to areas that were affected. This strategy also entails 

cooperate  approach  by  involving  all  relevant  Government,  Donor  community,  UN 

System, Private sector and NGOs agencies (both local and international). 

 

5.0 REQUIRED INTERVENTIONS 

 

As  reflected in  the 2010  In-Depth  Vulnerability  and  Needs  Assessment  report,  the 

required interventions involve  seven  (7)  sectors  with  activities  ranging  from  those 

of  short  to  medium  and  long  term.  The  main  sectors  involved  are  those  that  the 

assessment established  as  having  been  severely  affected  by  the  floods.  These  are 

Health  and  Nutrition,  Water  and  Sanitation,  Infrastructure,  Human  settlement and 

Shelter, Education, Agriculture and Food Security. 

 

5 

 

These  interventions  are  based  on  the  fact  that  there  is  some  level  of  response 

going  on  in  each  of  these  sectors.  This  level  of  response  however,  falls  short  of 

meeting  the  demands/needs  in  the  floods  affected  districts.    What  is  required 

therefore is the scaling up of the interventions so as to make them more effective 

and responsive to the needs of the affected districts. The required interventions are 

as summarised in the sector by activity in table 2 below:

6.0    IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 

In order to ensure maximum participation of all stakeholders and at the same time 

ensure  that  Portfolio  institutions  and  agencies  take  up  their  responsibilities  as  we 

scale-up  the  operation,  the  affected  sectors  in  conjunction  with  relevant  UN,  NGO 

and  Private  sector  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  their 

activities  based  on  the  sector  needs  as  per  attached  sector  specific  annexes. 

Satellite  Disaster  Management  Committees  in  conjunction  with  NGOs  will  be  front 

line  implementers  while  District  Disaster  Management  Committees  will  be  the 

overall district supervisors. 

 
 
6.1  Current level of response 
 
As mentioned earlier, it is important to recognize that a lot has already been 

done  by  Government in  collaboration  with its  co-operating  partners in  terms 

of response interventions.   

The  implementation  of  this  action  plan  should  therefore  be  seen  within  the 

context  of  scaling  up  of  the  existing  interventions  and  not  necessarily  kick-

starting of the recovery operation. 

 

6.2  Scaling Up 

 In  order  to  scale  up  the  level  of  current  response  and  make  the  operation 

more  effective  and  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  affected  populations, it is 

important 

that 

the  sector-based 

interventions  are 

implemented  as 

recommended (see Annexes 1 to 8 for more details). 

 

7.0    ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
The  major  stakeholders  such  as  the  Ministries  of  Education,  Health,  Agriculture, 

Works  and  Supply,  Department  of  Water  Affairs,  Local  Government  and  Housing, 

Community  Development,  Finance  and  Donor  community,  the  UN  system,  Private 

sector  including  NGOs  both  local  and  international  will  play  an  important  role  to 

ensure  that  the  planned  programmes  are  timely  and  efficiently  implemented  in 

order  for  the  programme  to  be  effective  and  responsive  enough  to  achieve  the 

programme objectives. Each Ministry/Department will nominate a dedicated officer 

who  will  be  part  of  the  coordination  core  team  to  overseer  the  implementation  of 

the  recommended  interventions.    Satellite  Disaster  Management  Committees  in 

conjunction with NGOs will be the front line implementers of the interventions while 

District  Disaster  Management  Committees  (DDMC)  will  have  the  district  overall 

supervisory responsibilities.  

  

8.0    TIME FRAME 

The  activities  will  be  implemented  within  twelve  (12)  months  beginning  in  August 

2010. This period will cover the implementation of short to medium and some long-

term interventions. 

 

9.0    REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS 

All implementing agencies will generate progress reports and submit them to DMMU 

through the National Coordinator on monthly basis.  DMMU will in turn consolidate 

the  sector  reports  in  one  document  and  submit  it  to  Government  and  other 

stakeholders for decision-making and information sharing. 

 

10.0   COORDINATION 

 

The coordination of the implementation of the rehabilitation plan (short to medium 

and long  term)  will be  spearheaded  by DMMU  supported  by  the  Coordination  Core 

Team  with  representation  from  Government,  Donors,  UN  system,  private  sector 

and NGOs.  

 

 

10 

11.0   MONITORING AND EVALUATION 

 

Monitoring of the implementation of interventions will be based on the indicators as 

brought  out  in  the  monitoring  and  valuation  indicators  table  (Refer  to  Table  3) 

and will be done at different levels namely: through reports, field trips involving a 

combined  team  of  main  stakeholders  or  individual  institutions  and  organizations. 

Political leadership at national, provincial and local levels will be critical in ensuring 

that the objectives of this recovery action plan are achieved in line with its rationale. 

  

Effectiveness  of  the  interventions  will  be  evaluated  in  terms  of  outcomes  and 

impact  on  the  target  population  and  districts.  A  final  impact  assessment  will  be 

conducted.  The  report  will  be  presented  to  Government  and  shared  with  other 

stakeholders for important reflections on the response and recovery programme.

ANNEXES 

Annex 1: EDUCATION 
 

Problem statement and rationale 

The  Education  Sector  was  not  spared  from  the  effects  of  the  floods  that  occurred 

during  the  2009/10  rainfall  season.  Arising  from  that,  learning  was  disrupted  as 

School Infrastructure got submerged and damaged resulting in some schools being 

closed and others were operating at half capacity.  

 

 

The  Ministry  of  Education  has  assessed  the  impact  of  the  floods  and  prioritized 

interventions  as  medium  and long term  to  rehabilitate the  damaged infrastructure 

upgrade temporal infrastructure and preposition school kits. 

 

Activities 

The  activities  to  be  implemented  in  the  medium  term  and  long  term  are  mainly 

rehabilitation  works  on  all  school  infrastructure  damaged  by  floods,  upgrading  of 

infrastructure  (Classrooms,  Teachersâ€™  houses,  VIP,  latrines)      that  is  built  from 

temporal materials, to make it resilient to floods, mapping of schools in flood prone 

areas,  train  school  Heads  and  communities  in  disaster  risk  reduction  (DRR) 

measures, and procurement and Pre-positioning of school in a box and recreational 

kits.  

 

Targets 

Carry out rehabilitation works at 32 schools in 12 districts in 5 provinces.  

 

Implementing Agency 

Ministry of Education will be the lead-implementing Agency and will be assisted by 

Cooperating Partners. 

 
Immediate Financial Requirements: ZMK 3,518,000,000.00 (US$703,600.00)

Annex 2: HEALTH 
 

PROBLEM STATEMENT 
The heavy rains and floods that the country experienced in the 2009-2010 rainy 
season had a significant impact on the health sector.  From the 2010 In Depth 
Assessment, the major challenges were: 

â€¢  High disease burden as demonstrated by the number of households reporting 

a sick member and the high frequency of occurrence of infectious diseases 
such as malaria, diarrheal diseases and Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI). 
This puts a strain on limited healthcare facilities as well as on healthcare 
providers. 

â€¢  Suboptimal childhood immunization coverage in some areas particularly for 

measles vaccine. These conditions are favorable for the occurrence of disease 
outbreaks. 

â€¢ 

 Poor sanitation and exposure to contaminated drinking water perpetuating 
the occurrence of diarrheal diseases such as cholera and dysentery 

â€¢  Destruction of health infrastructure 

 
ACTIVITIES 

â€¢  Disease surveillance, prevention and management 

o  Epidemic prone diseases : Malaria, diarrheal diseases 

o   Strengthen Immunization activities 

â€¢  Health Promotion 

o  Development , procurement and distribution of IEC materials 

o  PA System, Radio and television 

â€¢  Procurement of essential drugs and other non-medical supplies 

â€¢  Rehabilitation of Health Infrastructure 

 

 

         Financial Requirements: ZMK 13,247,644,000 (US$ 2,649,529)

Annex 3: NUTRITION 
 
Problem Statement 

Floods  are  likely  to  cause  numerous  health  and  nutritional  problems  in  the 

country. An anticipated increase in levels of food and nutrition insecurity and 

diseases  related  to  overcrowding  is  inevitable.  The  broad  nutrition  sector 

challenges include the following: 

 

â€¢  Disruption  of  preventive  health  and  nutrition  services  such  as 

inaccessible  health  facilities  and  inadequate  Growth  Monitoring  and 

promotion  service  points  and  the  resulting  surge  in  demand  at  other 

service  delivery  points  is  likely  to  result  in  shortages  of  essential 

medicines and nutrition supplies and over-stretched health staff.  

  

â€¢  Resultant  household 

food  and  nutrition 

insecurity  will 

lead  to 

malnutrition  and increased  susceptibility  to infectious  and immunizable 

diseases such as measles. 

  

           Activities 

The mitigation measures for Nutrition fall under the broad categories as 

shown in table1 below.

Target 
 
This  plan  targets  the  districts  moderately  or  severely  affected  by  floods.  The 

classification  is  based  on  reports  sent  to  DMMU,  field  reports,  key  informant 

interviews and the in-depth vulnerability assessment.  

 

Implementing Agency 

 

The National Food and Nutrition Commission, the Ministry of Health and its various 

Cooperating  partners  operating  in  the  field  of  nutrition  sectors  will  implement  this 

plan. 

 
 

 

Annex 4: HUMAN SETTLEMENT AND SHELTER  

 

Problem Statement 

During the 2009/10 rain season, a total of 17 districts experienced floods which led 

to the displacement of a number of households in 15 districts.  

 

The  vulnerability  of  the  affected  households  was  worsened  by  the  fact  that 

householdsâ€™  settlements  were  located  in  the  flood  prone  areas  coupled  with  the 

weak housing structures due to weak building materials used which are mainly pole, 

mud and grass.  

 

Although  the  impact  of  floods  on  human  settlements  was  low  in  terms  of  the 

number  of households  affected,  there is  need  to  reduce  such vulnerability  and  the 

impact  of  floods  by  realigning  the  settlements  located  in  low  lying  areas  prone  to 

flooding to higher and safer lan 

 

31 

 

ds. 

 

Furthermore, there is need to sensitize the vulnerable communities on the dangers 

of settling in flood water channels and the benefits of building better structures on 

higher and safer lands as a permanent solution. 

 

Activities 

1.  consultations  with local leadership  (traditional  and  district  administration)  on 

identification of safer lands 

2.  acquisition  of  such  safe  lands  to  resettle  the  communities  vulnerable  to 

flooding 

3.  conduct  a  survey  among  the  concerned  communities  to  determine  their 

willingness  to  relocate  to  higher  lands  and  educate  them  on  possible 

livelihood sources 

4.  site preparation of the new settlement 

a.  boundary delineation 

b.  plot demarcation 

c.  road clearing 

d.  borehole drilling 

e.  plot allocation 

f.  resettling of the new settlers 

The  action  plan will  be implemented in two  phases.  The  affected  districts  by  order 

of severity are as follows: - 

 

Phase I 

In phase 1, districts along the Zambezi River catchments are targeted. These are  

i.  Shangomboâ€™ 

ii.  Senanga 

iii. Mongu 

iv. Sesheke 

 

 

32 

 

Phase II 

In this phase, the following districts are targeted; 

i.  Lukulu 

ii.  Namwala 

iii. Sinazongwe 

Implementation Agency 

a.  The Department of Resettlement in conjunction with the Department of Physical 

Planning and Housing, UN-HABITAT, IOM, District Councils, Red Cross etc. 

b.  DMMU will coordinate the implementation 

 

Financial  Requirements:  An  estimated  budget  total  of  ZMKK663,  000,000  or 

(US$132,600.00)  will  be  required  to  undertake  the  above  alluded  to  activities  in 

both phases one and two.  

 

The tables below show the budgets for the implementation of the various activities 

and  the  activity  matrix  that  shall  guide  the  implementation  of  those  activities  in 

terms of time frame. 

After  the  implementation  of  both  phases  one  and  two,  the  department  of 

Resettlement  together  with  other  sector  partners  shall  under  the  coordination and 

funding by the DMMU relocate the affected and targeted households.

Annex: 5. INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
Problem Situation:  
Road infrastructure, such as embankments, bridges and culverts, were damaged in 
some  parts  of  the  country  due  to  heavy  rains  experienced  during  the  2008/9  and 
2009/10  rainfall  season.  The  hardest  hit  areas  were  Eastern,  Northern,  Western, 
Lusaka  and  Copperbelt  provinces  of  the  country.  This  has  impacted  negatively  on 
the social service delivery and economic development. 
 
Rationale 

 

To  develop  road  infrastructure  sector  reinstatements  to  the  affected  road 
infrastructure in order to restore accessibility to the affected areas. Therefore, there 
is need to carryout urgent repairs to ensure that: 

â€¢  Access  to  health  centers,  schools,  market  places  and  agricultural  areas  is   

restored; 

â€¢  The much-needed relief supplies are delivered to the affected communities.  

 
Activities  
 
The proposed intervention measures are outlined below: 

â€¢  Repair and installation of washed away culverts; 
â€¢  Reinstatement  of  washed/eroded  embankments  and  stone  pitching  the 

embankments; 

â€¢  Replacement of rotten timber bridges; 
â€¢  Reinforcing the existing bridge decks; 
â€¢  Reinstatement of washed away bridges with permanent structures; 
â€¢  Provision  of  vented drifts to allow for overtopping; and  
â€¢  Heavy  dredging  works  using  specialized  machinery  for  the  clearing  and 

construction of channels. 

 
Target  
 
The target is to reinstate the following 344 road and drainage structures in the 66 
districts which experienced severe floods:  

â€¢  Thirty four (34) Bridges;  
â€¢  Two hundred and Ninety  (290) Culverts; 
â€¢  Fifteen (15) Embankment structures; and 
â€¢  Five (05) road sections that have experienced severe erosion.

The Annual Work Plan 2010 for the RDA allowed for an amount of 3.549 Billion Kwacha for emergencies which has since been used 
and exhausted for other major emergencies on the Maamba â€“ Batoka road in Southern province and reinstatement of culverts in 
Western, Northern, Lusaka, Central and North â€“ western Provinces.  
 
The projects were listed in order of priority from all the districts. The first three were taken as priority 1, 2, and 3 if the district had 
more than three projects the process was repeated for the remaining ones until all projects were classified.

Annex 6: SOCIAL PROTECTION 
 

Problem statement and rationale 

The  assessment  established  that  the  communities  were  affected  by  the  disasters 

and  this  compounded  their  vulnerability  and  poverty  situation.  The  supportive 

mechanisms  on  which  the  families  depend  on  were  affected  and  there  were 

reported cases of gender based violence and child abuse during the disaster among 

the  assessed  districts.    Further,  the  communities  reported  that  the  exiting 

institutions  and  NGOs  were  not  with  the  vicinity  to  report  cases  of  gender  based 

violence and child abuse. 

  

Social protection should ideally seek to reduce peopleâ€™s vulnerability and poverty as 

well as prevent and put an end to violence, exploitation and abuse against children, 

women and other vulnerable groups during an emergency. This should be done by 

strengthening  the  ability  of  individuals  and  families  to  protect  themselves  from 

future  threats  thereby  laying  the  foundation  for  lasting  security  and  stability. 

Individuals and families will only be able protect themselves if all stakeholders and 

child  protection  workers  endeavor  to  create  a  protective  environment  which  will 

warrant protection in emergency situations.  

 

Activities 

The mitigation measures for the Protection sector will include the following: 

â€¢  Prevention - Initiate and promote family and community level safety 

â€¢  Awareness raising on childrenâ€™s and womenâ€™s rights 

â€¢  Psychosocial support 

â€¢  Empowerment of families 

 

All activities will be centered on creating a protective environment for children and 

their families.

Annex 7: WATER AND SANITATION 
 
 
Problem Statement and Rationale 
 

During the  2009/10  floods,  13.4%  of  the  protected  water  sources  commonly used 

for domestic purposes was affected by the floods resulting in communities drawing 

water  from  unprotected  water  sources  as  the  alternative.  Those  that  continued  to 

use  the  affected  protected  water  sources  were  still  drawing  unsafe  or  potentially 

unsafe  water  as  the  quality  of  the  water  these  affected  sources  produced  went 

significantly down.  

 

From the assessment, it is also revealed that 40.6% of the latrines in the affected 

areas collapsed due to the floods. Only 47.6% of the communities wash their hands 

with  soap.  This  is  assumed  to  have  resulted  in  contributing  to  the  increased 

occurrence of water borne diseases 

 

It is therefore necessary that the damaged water facilities are urgently rehabilitated. 

Furthermore, the affected communities should be sensitized on hand washing with 

soap, water treatment and proper hygiene practices. It is also necessary to provide 

chlorine for treatment of drinking water.  

 

Activities 

 

The sector will address household level and community water safety and awareness 

raising  on  improved  sanitary  disposal  and  hygiene  practices.  Apart  from  a  few 

minor  alterations  as  explained  in  the  report,  very  little  was  done  during  the 

2008/09  floods  on  the  work  plan  and  the  identified  mitigating  measures.  Most  of 

the identified measures are still not adequately addressed, therefore the mitigation 

measures for Water & Sanitation save for a few additions are as shown in the table 

below;
