Executive Summary 
 

The 2009/10 rain season was characterised by heavy rainfall in most parts of the country. 

The  extreme  southern  parts of  the  country  experienced  a  late  start  while  the  rest  of  the 

country experienced  normal start. Overall,  most parts of the country received  normal to 

above normal rainfall which led to excessive rains that culminated into flash flood in low 

lying  areas  and  water  logging  in  plateau  areas.  The  excessive  rainfall  experienced 

resulted into varying impacts on key sectors of the economic.  

 

Following  reports  from  District  Disaster  Management  Committees  (DDMCs)  in 

seventeen  (17)  districts  in  Central,  Eastern,  Lusaka,  North  Western,  Southern  and 

Western  Provinces  on  the  negative  effects  the  floods  and/or  dry  spells,  the  Zambia 

Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee  (ZVAC)  undertook  an  in-depth  assessment.    The 

districts  visited  were  Serenje,  Mambwe,  Luangwa,  Kafue,  Chavuma,  Zambezi, 

Mwinilunga,  Lukulu,  Kaoma,  Mongu,  Kalabo,  Shang’ombo,  Senanga,  Sesheke, 

Namwala, Gwembe, Sinazongwe and Kazungula. 

The assessment employed the qualitative and quantitative approaches in the collection of 

data. A total of 3, 099 households in 208 Standard Enumeration Areas (SEAs) in fifteen 

(15) districts with an estimated population of 1.7 million people. Under the quantitative 

approach,  structured  household  questionnaires  were  used  in  208  SEAs.  Under  the 

qualitative  approach,  community  interviews  were  conducted  in  all  the  238  SEAs  while 

one district interview was conducted in each of the district assessed. Anthropometric data 

was collected for under-five children in all the 208 SEAs.  

Major Findings 

•  The  assessment  established  that  a  total  of  238,254  people  (39,709  households) 

were affected by the floods and/or dry spells in one way or another. 

•  Production of Staple in the assessed increased compared to previous season. 80% 

of communities grew maize as their staple.

•  The  prices  of  maize  in  the  surveyed  area  remained  stable  in  most  districts. 

Lukulu, Serenje and Mambwe showed a slight increase in prices. 

•  Livestock  production  was  key  livelihood  for  most  of  the  assessed  districts 

(Western and Southern Zambia). Cattle prices generally remained the same as last 

year. Increase suggest household not desperate to sell to meet food needs. 

•  53,629  people  in  four  (4)  districts  found  to  be  food  insecure  (Luangwa, 

Lukulu,Namwala and Sesheke. 

•  The  food insecurity  in  Luangwa, Sesheke and  Lukulu  is of a chronic  nature and 

therefore may require sustainable interventions 

•  50%  of  Households  indicated  having  two  meals  a  day  which  is  normal.  Few 

households (2%) indicated having 3 meals while only 4% indicated having only 1 

meal a day.  

•  Common  coping  strategies  that  sampled  households  employed  were  eating  of 

meals with vegetables (50%).   

•  Coping strategies relating to expenditure and income were  insignificant  

•  No major unsustainable  coping  mechanisms were employed to signal  stress as  a 

result  of  hunger  from  the  sampled  households.  This  is  a  sign  that  most of  these 

households resilience levels are progressively improving over time. 

•  14% indicated having been warned about the dry spells while 22% were warned 

about the floods. 

•  Of those that indicated having received the warning, 23% indicated that they did 

not take any measures. 

• 

Infrastructure  sector  was  the  worst  hit.Roads,  bridges  and  culverts  were  washed 

away  by  the  flood  waters.  School  infrastructure  also  suffered  major  damage 

(mainly damaged  in  Western and North-Western Provinces. A  number of school 

and health infrastructure were also damaged. 

•  The SAM was established to be at 5.6% out of which 1.0 % had bilateral oedema 

while GAM was found to be at 10.2%. 

•  There  was  a  marginal  increase  in  diarrhoea  cases  mainly  for  the  displaced. 

Malarial Cases were also on the increase.

• 

Immunization Coverage was high in the entire districts assessed Measles-86.5%, 

OPV3– 91.8%, DPT/HepB/Hib3 - 93.5 and BCG – 95.1%) 

•  The coverage for Vitamin A supplementation stood at 71% which was below the 

required  80%  especially  for  Shang’ombo  (31.6%)  and  Sesheke  (46.9). This  was 

attributed  to  logistical  constraints  faced  by  the  districts  to  access  some  flood 

affected areas and also inadequate health personnel. 

•  About  29.2% of the sampled households indicated that they treated their drinking 

water 

•  The assessment established that only 48.6 %used soap when washing hands. 

•  About 95% of the households indicated that they did not have any boys and girls 

that dropped out of school.  

• 

• 

 About 5.2% of children dropped out of school due mainly to reasons other than 

floods.Main reason for dropping out school was family could not afford fees 

Incidences of violence against women and children in the communities and camps 

not  very  common.  The  most  common  cases  in  order  of  ranking  were;  early 

marriages (23.6%), assault (19.4%), sexual exploitation (7.2%), rape (5.2%) and 

child  defilement  (9%).  Perpetrators  of  violence  mainly  relatives  or  neighbours 

Attribution of these incidences to floods not very clear. 

•  Cases of children drowning and displaced stood at 14.5% 9.7% respectively. 

 
CONCLUSIONS   
 
The assessment established that a total of 238,254 people (39,709 households) were 

affected by the floods and/or dry spells in one way or another. 

The sector specific conclusions are reflected below: 

 

Infrastructure 
 
The assessment established that there was significant damage done to roads, health and 

school infrastructure. About 344 road and drainage structures were damaged and need to 

be reinstated. These structures include those that were not worked on from the previous 

season (Refer to the technical report on the Washed away and affected Drainage

structures by 2008/9 and 2009/10 rains, RDA, July 2010.  The school and health 

infrastructure has been covered under the respective sectors. 

 
 Agriculture and Food Security 
 

Overall,  agriculture  production  for  the  2009/10  agriculture  season  has  performed  better 

than  in  2008/09  season.  The  production  of  major  staple  food  crops  such  as  maize, 

sorghum,  rice,  groundnuts,  Irish  potatoes,  mixes  beans,  sweet  potatoes  and  cassava 

increased  in  the  2009/10  agricultural  season  when  compared  to  the  previous  season. 

Maize production for instance, increased sharply by 48 percent from 1,887,010 MT in the 

2008/2009 season to 2,795,483 MT in the 2009/2010 season. The increase in production has 

inevitably  pushed  down  the  price  of  most  food  crops  especially  maize,  thereby  improving 

access  to  the  staple  food  for  most  households  and  communities.  Maize  production  has 

increased  in  Serenje,  Kafue,  Kazungula,  Sinazongwe,  Kalabo,  Mongu  and  Senanga. 

However maize production has decreased in other districts such as Luangwa, Namwala, 

Lukulu and Sesheke. 

 

Based  on  maize  production,  the  four  (4)  districts  that  experienced  a  reduction  in  the 

harvest of the main staple will therefore need to be targeted for intervention to sustain the 

livelihood of the affected communities. 

 

Despite  the  increase  in  maize  production  in  Mambwe,  Chavuma,  Gwembe,  and 

Shang’ombo, these districts should continue to be monitored because these districts were 

either affected by floods or prolonged dry spells.  

 

 Nutrition 
 
The  assessment  revealed 

that  about  37.6%  of 

the  children  started  receiving 

complementary  foods  before  the  age  of  six  months  and  therefore,  were  not  exclusively 

breastfed in the first six months.  This is a cause for concern for vulnerable households as 

the  introduction  of  other  foods  makes  the  children  more  susceptible  to  illness  such 

diarrhoea which may lead malnutrition.  In addition, children in vulnerable household are 

 

 

 

 

                                                                                                                                                                                     

xii 

already exposed to other factors such as poor water and sanitation and inadequate access 

to health services that compromise their health and nutrition.    

 

The overall vitamin A supplentation coverage of 71% for the districts assessed was below 

the  desirable  national  target  of  80%  in  particular  for  Shangombo  (31.2%)  and  Sesheke 

(46.9%).  Therefore, there is need to step up the efforts in order to increase the coverage.  

 

The coverage of supplementary and therapeutic feeding programmes was low across the 

districts  assessed.      This  is  a  concern  as  some  children  requiring  these  services  do  not 

have  access  to  these  programmes  and  may  report  late  for  treatment.    Accessibility  to 

these  services  should  be  increased  by  establishing  interventions  such  as  CTC  and 

supplementary feeding programmes  in the affected areas.  

  

The  results of the assessment revealed that stunting, wasting and underweight were co-

existing  in  the  assessed  communities.  The  high  levels  of  malnutrition  observed  in  the 

communities  assessed  can  be    attributed  to  both  chronic  and    transient  factors.  The 

observed  status  quo  is  compounded  by  the  exposure  of  communities  in  the  assessed 

districts  to  shocks  such  as  floods  and  dry  spells.  In  addition  to  inadequate  food  intake, 

children  in  these  communities  are  also  from  households  exposed  to  high  poverty  levels 

with  limited  access  to  health  and  education  services,  exercebating  an  already  fragile 

situation.  There  is  therefore  a  need  for  the  implementation  of  both  short  and  long  term 

interventions to address the prevailing situation. 

 

 Water and Sanitation 
 

The  assessment  revealed  that  even  though  communities  have  access  to  protected  water 

sources in the affected areas 56.7%, during floods, the access dropped to 43.3% and the 

quality of water from the protected sources within the affected areas dropped to   69.3 %. 

It is therefore necessary to consider relocation of communities within the risk areas as a 

long term solution. 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                                                                                                                                                     

xiii 

It is evident that communities are aware of the dangers of using unsafe water as 29.2% 

treat  their  water  through.  Application  of  chlorine,  boiling    and    awareness  needs  to  be 

created with regards to the use of  soap for hand  washing as only 48.6 %use soap when 

washing hands. 

It is also clear that communities value having proper latrines as  57.7% have latrines and 

are only inhibited by the fact that 13.4% of these collapse during floods. 

 
Health 
 

The survey found that 69.2% of the under five children had suffered from fever/suspected 

malaria, diarrhea (watery stool), cough, or skin infection while 30.8% did not suffer from 

any  illness.  The  assessment  established  that  immunization  coverage  was  high  in  all  the 

assessed districts. 

 

 Education 
 

Analysis of the report has revealed that 94.5 % of the respondents did not have any boys 

dropping out and 95.1% of the respondents did not have girls dropping out of school. Of 

the  families  reporting  children  dropping  out,  3.7%  reported  one  male  child  having 

dropped  and  the  same  percentage  for  female  children.  A  fewer  number  of  respondents 

equivalent to 1.3% reported 2 boys dropping out and 1% reported 2 girls dropping out. In 

comparison  terms,  there  are  more  boys  dropping  out  of  school  than  girls.  The  main 

reason  for  boys  dropping  out  of  school  was  inability  for  the  family  to  pay  school  fees 

(3.7%) followed by lack of interest on the part of the boy to continue school (0.6%). The 

boys who dropped out were later engaged in work outside the family for cash. On the part 

of  girls’  dropouts,  3.3%  dropped  out  on  account  of  the  inability  by  the  family  to  pay 

school fees, and 0.7% dropped out on account of early marriages. 

At  district  level,  Mambwe  reported  the  highest  number  of  boys  dropping  out  at  11.8% 

followed  by  Senanga  with  9.1%,  Mongu  at  8.6%  and  Kalabo  at  8.2%.  Kalabo  district 

reported the highest number of girls dropping out (9.6%) of school, followed by Mongu 

and Kafue at 8.1% and Mambwe at 7.6%. 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                                                                                                                                                     

xiv 

 Social Protection 
 

There  is  lack  of  safety  awareness  among  the  communities  and  as  a  result  24  children 

drowned  in  the  affected  areas.  As  a  result,  there  was  concern  by  this  survey  regarding 

cases of gender  based  violence and abuse as well as the plight of children  in  areas that 

experienced floods and dry spells in the seventeen (17) districts that were assessed. It was 

evident  that  due  to  cultural  practices,  people  hide  cases  of  GBV  for  fear  of  being 

reprimanded  by  their  family  members  and  the  larger  community.  Additionally,  despite 

the  reporting  mechanisms  existing  in  the  affected  areas,  the  institutions  providing  the 

services  are  far  away  from  the  community  and  this  makes  it  difficult  for  the 

survivors/victims to report their cases.   Finally, cases of forced labour for children were 

reports  unfortunately  this  is  seen  as  child  labour  contribution  to  the  household  even 

though a  number of children  are pulled out of school to supplement  food rations  in the 

home 

  

 Human Habitation and Shelter 
 
These communities need to be sensitized on the importance of having dual residence, one 

 

in  the  low  lying  areas  with  soils  that  are  reach  with  mineral  deposits  and  the  other  in 

higher and safer lands where they could take refuge in times of flooding. This should be 

done  on  voluntary  basis  and  people  should  not  be  forced  to  migrate.  The  role  of 

government  would  be  to  identify  higher  and  safer  lands  where  these  communities  can 

build their second homes. This should be done with the help of the local and traditional 

leadership.  Upon  identification  and  acquiring  of  such  higher  land  for  the  flood  prone 

communities, and where the concerned  communities agree to build their second  homes, 

govenment would facilitate the establishment of such settlements by demarcating the land 

into plots for each household, and also provide basic infrastructure such as access roads, 

water, health and education in the new settlements. This way resilience would have been 

created for such communities to respond to hazards such as floods on their own without 

or with minimum external intervention.   

 

 

 

 

 

                                                                                                                                                                                     

xv 

The state of the majority of the houses occupied by the displaced households suggest that 

these are communities who depend on subsistence farming and fishing and can not afford 

to  build  conversional  houses,  hence,  they  build  the  weak  housing  structures  with  pole 

mud  and  grass.  This  suggests  also  that,  they  have  very  low  capacity  to  respond  to 

hazardous situations  such as  floods. Government and other stakeholders should provide 

long term solution to the these communities who have settled in flood prone areas.  

 

RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Infrastructure 
 

•  There is need to mobilize funds to rehabilitate damaged infrastructure in 66 

districts.  

 

• 

In the medium to long term there is need for government to invest in the 
construction of canal in the flood prone areas. The construction should be based 
on the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) conducted in these areas. 

  
Agriculture and Food Security 
 
Short-term  

•  Market  intervention  in  Luangwa,  Namwala,  Lukulu  and  Sesheke  (off-load 

commercial  maize)  to  mitigate  the  food  insecurity  in  these  districts  until  the 

next harvest.   

•  Four  districts  namely  Mambwe,  Chavuma,  Gwembe,  and  Shang’ombo  be 

placed under monitoring 

•  Provide market support to the populations from surplus districts who may not 

manage to sell the surplus maize to FRA (e.g. WFP purchase for progress). 

 
Water and Sanitation 
 
It  is  worth  noting  that  very  little  was  done  regarding  the  implementation  of  the 

recommendations  for  the  2009/10  recommendations  and  work  plan  due  to  budgetary 

constraints and therefore most of the recommendations activities identified still remain as 

recommendations and action plan for 2010/11

1.0. INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1.  Background 
  
The  2009/10  rain  season  was  characterised  by  heavy  rainfall  in  most  parts of  the  country.  The  extreme 

southern  parts  of  the  country  experienced  a  late  start  while  the  rest  of  the  country  experienced  normal 

start. Overall, most parts of the country received normal to above normal rainfall which led to excessive 

rains that culminated into flash flood in low lying areas and water logging in plateau areas. The excessive 

rainfall experienced resulted into varying impacts on key sectors of the economic.  

 

Following reports from District Disaster Management Committees (DDMCs) in seventeen (17) districts in 

Central,  Eastern,  Lusaka,  North  Western,  Southern  and  Western  Provinces  on  the  negative  effects  the 

floods and/or dry spells, the Zambia Vulnerability Assessment Committee (ZVAC) undertook an in-depth 

assessment. The provinces and districts where the assessments were undertaken included the following: 

i.  Central Province – Serenje 

ii.  Eastern Province – Mambwe 

iii.  Lusaka Province – Kafue and Luangwa 

iv.  North-Western Province – Chavuma, Mwinilunga and Zambezi 

v.  Southern Province – Kazungula, Namwala, Gwembe and Sinazongwe 
vi.   Western Province – Kalabo, Lukulu, Mongu, Senanga, Shang’ombo and Sesheke 

The criteria used to select the above mentioned districts for assessment was as follows: 

i. 

Rainfall: 

-  Rainfall distribution for the months of December, January and February 

-  Rainfall  cumulative  performance  mainly  decadal  cumulative  figures  for  the  months  of 

December, January and February 

-  Duration of dry spells 

Percentage crop and livestock damage/loss 

District Production figures for the main staple compared to the previous season. 

ii. 

iii. 

The  report,  therefore,  presents  the  findings  of  the  2010  In-depth  Vulnerability  and  Needs  Assessment 

conducted  to  determine  the  extent  and  effects  of  the  floods  and/or  dry  spells  on  agriculture  and  food 

security, infrastructure, health and nutrition, water and sanitation, habitation and human shelter and social 

protection.

1.2  Objectives 

 
1.2.1 Overall Objective 
The  overall  objective  of  the  assessment  was  to  determine  the  impact  of  the  adverse  rainfall  and/or  dry 

spell on different sectors and recommend appropriate action for mitigation and response.  

 

1.2.2 Specific Objectives 

 
i.   To determine the full extent to which floods and/or dry spell impacted the following sub-sectors:  

•  Crops and livestock 

•  Livelihoods of affected communities 

•  Water and Sanitation 

•  Education 

•  Human Settlement and Shelter 

•  Markets 

• 

Infrastructure 

•  Health and Nutrition status of under-five children 

To determine the areas as well as the population affected 

To determine extent of violence against women and children in flood affected areas. 

To determine the food and non-food needs in the affected areas, if any.

 1.3 Scope of the In-Depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment. 

 
The ZVAC conducted the in-depth assessment in Central, Eastern, Lusaka, Northern, North Western and 

Western Provinces where seventeen (17) districts were adversely affected by floods and/or dry spells. The 

sectors impacted upon by the floods included health and nutrition, water and sanitation, education, 

infrastructure, human shelter and habitation, agriculture and food security and social protection.   

 

The assessment was designed in such a way that data collection was conducted at three (3) levels of the 

district. The entry level for the teams collecting the in-depth assessment data was at the district level 

through the District Disaster Management Committees (DDMCs) where meetings were held. The next 

level was the community where community leaders were interviewed through Focused Group Discussions 

(FGDs). The last level was at the household level where a structure questionnaire was utilised to conduct 

the interview.

1.4 Methods and Procedures 
 

1.4.1 Target Population 
 

The target population is the number of people living in the districts identified to have been affected by the 

floods that occurred during the 2009/2010 rainy season.  

 

1.4.2 Sampling Frame 
 

The sampling frame used for the 2010 In-Depth Vulnerability and Assessment Survey was developed 

from the 2000 Census of Population and Housing. The frame is administratively demarcated into 9 

provinces, which are divided into 72 districts. The districts are further subdivided into 150 constituencies, 

which are also divided into 1, 289 wards. For statistical purposes, the wards are divided into Census 

Supervisory Areas and these are in turn divided into Standard Enumeration Areas (SEAs). The SEAs are 

further stratified into rural and urban strata. The frame has information on the number of households and 

the population at SEA level. For the purposes of this survey, the SEA constituted the ultimate Primary 

Sampling Unit (PSU).  

 

The survey originally targeted 17 districts2 in 6 provinces. In order to have equal precision in the estimates 

in all the districts, the Equal Sample Allocation Method was adopted. Fourteen SEAs/PSUs were 

originally selected to be covered in each district.  

 

1.4.3 Sampling Method 
 

The 2010 In-Depth Vulnerability and Assessment Survey employed probability sampling procedures: a 

two-stage stratified cluster sample design was used. In the first stage, 14 SEAs were selected using the 

Probability Proportional to Estimated Size (PPES) procedure. During the second stage, about 15 

households were randomly selected from each enumeration area. Random in no way implies haphazard; 

rather it means that each possible household had an equal chance of being selected.

 15 districts were actually covered. Post-stratification was used to adjust for this non-coverage.

1.4.4 Sample Size 
 

A total of 3, 099 households in 208 SEAs were covered in the 15 districts with an estimated population of 

1.7 million people. The table below shows the estimated population, PSU’s and the number of households

might  lead  to  bias  and  other  departures  between  the  sample  and  the  reference  population.  Such 

imperfections  included the selection of units with unequal probabilities, non-coverage of the population, 

and  non-response.  Thus  sample  weights  act  as  inflation  factors  to  represent  the  number  of  units  in  the 

survey population that are accounted for by the sample unit to which the weight is assigned. The sum of 

the  sample  weights  provides  an  unbiased  estimate  of  the  total  number  of  individuals  in  the  target 

population.

1.5.1 Base Weights 
 

The  base  weights  for  each  sampled  standard  enumeration  area  were  constructed  in  order  to  correct  for 

their unequal probabilities of selection. Since a two-stage sample design was developed, the base weights 

were constructed to reflect the probabilities of selection at each stage.  

 

Given that

misunderstanding the questions or from an  incorrect presentation of the questions; errors resulting  from 

non-response; errors in data entry; errors in coding.  

 

While  the  sampling  errors  can  be  estimated  through  the  survey  data,  it  is  difficult  to  assess  the  non-

sampling errors. The report therefore contains no quantitative assessments of these errors. Nevertheless, it 

is  important  to  emphasize  that  in  planning  and  conducting  the  survey,  efforts  were  made  to  reduce  as 

much as possible the number of errors, both sampling and non-sampling errors.  

 

1.7. Estimates for Nutrition Component 
 

1.7.1. Sample size and sampling process for the household survey 
In  the  calculation  for  the  minimum  number  of  children  required  for  the  whole  survey  for  key  nutrition 

indicators, it was found that 1,300 children would be required to get estimates at 95% confidence level in 

the  entire  survey  (15  districts)  that  is  the  minimum  number.  Based  on  the  national  and  NGO  nutrition 

surveys,  assumptions  were  made  that  each  household  would  have  an  average  of  one  child  aged  6  to  59 

months, a household size of six  members and one  mother. Prevalence estimates were based on previous 

surveys  carried out by Government departments  in charge of  nutrition and other UN and NGO agencies 

national  wide.  Due  to the  two-stage  sampling  technique  that  was  used,  it  was  necessary  to  increase  the 

sample size  by a  factor that would allow  for any  loss  in precision due to departure from  simple random 

sampling.  This  was  estimated  using  the  Rapid  Nutrition  Survey  of  2005  and  the  targeted  nutrition 

assessment  conducted  in  2006  by  GRZ,  UNICEF  and  WFP.  The  3,570  households  covered  in  the  In-

Depth  study  were  more  than  adequate  to  meet  the  minimum  sample  size.  The  number  of  children  that 

were successfully measured in the study was 1, 643.  

 

1.7.2 Anthropometric measurement 

 
Anthropometric  measurements were  made  visa-a-vis children’s weight, height/length, and assessment of 

the presence of bilateral oedema. Children were weighed to the nearest 100 grams using a digital SECA 

scale.  For  children  younger  than  2  years  of  age  or  less  than  85  centimetres  (cm)  long,  length  was 

measured to the nearest millimetre in the recumbent position using a standard height board. Children 85 to 

110 cm were  measured  in a standing position. Oedema was assessed  by  applying thumb pressure to the 

feet for approximately 3 seconds and then examining for the presence of a shallow print or pit. 

 

 
 

 

6 

1.7.3. Nutrition Cut-off points for children 

 
Child nutrition status in the 2010 in-depth vulnerability assessment was determined according to the new 

2006) WHO Child Growth Standards.3 The cut – off point for the anthropometric measurements taken by 

children were as follows: 

Moderate malnutrition< -2 W/H Z-scores and >-3 Z-scores 

Severe malnutrition:  <- 3 W/H Z-scores and/or presence of bilateral pitting (oedema) of the feet. 

 

 

The prevalence of malnutrition in children below <-2 and <-3 Z-scores, and the confidence intervals were 

worked  on  to  indicate  the  precision  of  the  estimate  obtained.  The  age  and  sex  distribution  of  the 

population was analyzed to see whether there was any abnormality. A high prevalence of malnutrition in 

children above 36 months is usually an indicator of acute food insecurity.    

 

1.8. Estimating Food Production in Maize Equivalent 

 
To estimate the production of main staples produced by the sampled households in maize equivalent for 

the 2009/10-production season, each of the produced cereals and/or tubers was converted into maize kilo 

calorie equivalent as a common unit. Maize was used as a common unit because it is widely consumed in 

most parts of the country. To obtain the total produced quantities of maize equivalent, each of the crops 

was first converted to maize kilo calorie equivalent using the formula below;

The  calorie  contents  of  various  crop  commodities  were  obtained  from  FAO  (1997).  The  total  maize 

equivalent  produced  was  therefore  a  summation  of  all  the  produced  staple  crops  by  the  sampled 

households as well as staples from other sources such as carry-over stocks, remittances and purchases.

 The 1977 NCHS/WHO growth reference standards were used to assess child nutrition status for the 2009 in-depth VAC report.

1.9. Identifying Desperate Areas and Persons 
 

Using the 2008/09 household production data as a base for determining the production gap, the production 

estimates  for  2009/10  for  all  the  visited  districts  were  reviewed  by  comparing  2008/09  and  2009/10 

production.  All  districts  that  had  percentage  increase  of  10%  or  less  were  flagged  as  potential  hotspot 

areas. The assumption is that households in these districts did not recover substantially from the adverse 

impacts of the 2007/08  floods. Furthermore, the  little positive change  in production recorded during the 

2008/09  season  will  not  be  enough  to  stretch  these  affected  households  to the  next  harvest  due  to  their 

already  eroded  livelihood  base  such  as  unsustainable  consumption  strategies  (over  reliance  on  less 

expensive  foods  that  are  not  nutritious  ,  high  percentage  expenditure  on  food  items.  The  other 

consideration is that these household’s improved livelihoods during the 2008/09 season, will start to fade 

away as the peak lean period is reached. 

The following formula was used to determine the production gap which was further used to select the hot 

spot districts: 

 

 

The number of the affected persons in need of the food support was derived through a proportional pilling 

method  and  validated  by  the  percentage  of  households  affected  as  depicted  in  the  Rapid  Assessment  in 

May  2009.  Asset  ownership  amongst  the  sampled  households  was  also  taken  into  consideration  in 

determining  the  ability  for  the  affected  households  in  cushioning  the  food  gap.  This  was  going  to  be 

through potential disposal of their assets without necessarily eroding their livelihoods further.  

The  districts  that  had  a  percentage  increase  of  between  10%  and  15%  were  flagged  as  those  requiring 

monitoring. The other attributes used for the hotspots also applied to those districts determined to be on 

monitoring.

1.9.1. Determination of Cereal Requirements for the Affected Population in Food   Insecure           
District  
 

The assessment used the following formula to determine the amount of cereal required by those affected: 

 

MAIZE REQUIREMENT1 = STANDARD RATION2 X # OF MONTHS3 X # AFFECTED PEOPLE  

                                                                                         1000 

 

 

Where, 

1  =  Total maize requirements in Metric Tonnes (MT) refers to total quantity of maize required in  

     the affected district  

2  =  Standard ration = 250grammes per person per day  

3  =  Number of months = duration of the food assistance  

 

1.5 

Limitations 

 

The limitations faced by the survey included the following: 

• 

 Information on water quality was qualitative based on aesthetic characteristics as the actual scientific 

tests of water could not be done within the framework of the assessment. 

•  The small sample size for nutrition does not permit making generalizations at district level. 

•  The  teams  had  to  rely  on  air  transport  due to  inaccessibility  of  some  of  the  flood  affected  districts. 

This caused some delay for the teams to access the particular SEAs that were inaccessible.

2.0. CONTEXT 
 

2.1. The Economy  

 

In  the  last  few  years,  Zambia  has  realized  continued  economic  growth  as  measured  by  the  real  gross 

domestic product (real GDP), with the exception of the year 2008 when the economy contracted due to the 

effects of the global financial crisis. In 2009, the economy in Zambia started on a slow path to recovery 

from  the  financial  crisis  experienced  in  2008.  In  2009, the  economy  grew  by  6.3%,  an  8  %  increase  in 

comparison  to  the  5.8%  growth  achieved  in  2008.  The  economic  performance  was  largely  driven  by 

growth in the  mining, agriculture and construction sectors. The  mining sector had a projected growth of 

13.1%  in  2009,  driven  by  improved  copper  prices,  a  more  conducive  business  environment,  and  the 

commencement  of  production  at  Lumwana  Copper  Mine.  However,  poor  performance  in  the  tourism 

sector, as well as the slowdown in the manufacturing sector in the same period contracted overall growth. 

The manufacturing sector was affected by low demand and the rise in the costs of imported inputs, with 

growth in the sector declining to 1.0 percent in 2009 from the 1.8% outturn in 2008. The tourism sector 

was also adversely affected by the global economic crisis, as there was a sharp fall in tourist visits to the 

country.  

 

Government  policy  as  articulated  under  the  FNDP  is  to  achieve  and  sustain  single  digit  inflation  rates.  

Although the 2008 year end inflation rate rose to 16.6% which was fuelled by increases in food prices as 

well as increases in energy and transportation costs, the rate of inflation declined to 9.9 % by December 

2009. Food inflation particularly declined significantly from 20.5 percent at the end of 2008 to 8.0 percent 

at the end of 2009. The decline was a result of reductions in the prices of fresh vegetables and fruits, as 

well as oils and fats. However, increases were recorded in the cost of mealie meal, maize grain and cereal 

products. 

 

In  the  first  half  of  2009,  the  exchange  rate  of  the  Kwacha  depreciated  against  major  international 

currencies, largely on account of the continuing adverse effects arising from the global financial crisis in 

2008.  However,  in  the  second  half  of  the  year, the  currency  began  to  appreciate  building  on  improving 

investor confidence in the Zambian economy. The average exchange rate of the Kwacha against the U.S 

dollar closed at K4, 580  in December 2009 compared with  K4, 883  in December 2008, representing an 

appreciation of 6.0 percent. As a result of the  inflationary environment which prevailed  in  part of  2008 

and 2009, interest rates have been increasing. Commercial bank lending rates increased from 26.8 percent 

 
 

 

10 

in  2008  to  29.6  percent  in  September  2009.  However,  interest  rates  on  government  securities  remained 

stable during this time. 

 

Preliminary  estimates  indicate  that  the  agriculture  sector  grew  by  7.1%  in  2009  compared  to  a  2.6% 

increase in 2008. The improvement has been largely attributed to the increase in the maize harvest in the 

2008/09  agricultural  season  of  1.9  million  metric  tonnes,  compared  with  the  1.5  million  metric  tonnes 

produced in 2008. The 2008/09 production season was characterized by average to above average rainfall 

across  the  country,  resulting  in  an  increase  in  maize  production  by  26.7%  compared  to  the  2007/08 

agricultural season. Although the increased production resulted in increased supply on the market, maize 

prices remained abnormally high in 2009, as a result of high input, power and fuel costs. However, with 

the  large  production  from  the  2009/10  season,  adequate  national  stocks  are  available  to  meet  national 

demand,  while  keeping  the  local  market  well  supplied  and  ensuring  reduced  staple  food  prices  for 

consumers as compared to last year.  

 

2.2.  Agriculture and Food Security 
 

2.2.1 Input Distribution 

 
2.2.1.1 Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP) 

 
In  the  last  agricultural  season,  Government  and  other  agencies  continued  to  implement  input  support 

programs,  with  the  aim  of  increasing  small-scale  farmer  access  to  inputs  for  increased  production  and 

productivity.  The  major  input  programme  during  the  2009/10  agricultural  season  was  the  GRZ  Farmer 

Input Support Programme (FISP) which was launched by Government at the start of the season to replace 

the Fertilizer Support Programme (FSP), which had been running since the 2002/2003 season. The main 

objective of the FISP is to increase efficiency and effectiveness of farmers’ use of inputs, and improve the 

beneficiaries’ potential of contributing to increased food security and incomes.  

 

The  Farmer  Input  Support  Programme  reduced  the  size  of  the  input  pack,  but  increased  the  number  of 

beneficiaries to 500,000 from the 200,000 that was covered in the last season.  The reduction of the size of 

the pack from one hectare to half a hectare is to enable more efficient and effective management of maize 

fields  by  beneficiaries,  resulting  in  increased  productivity.  In  addition  to  the  increased  number  of 

beneficiaries  and  overall  improvements  in  the  input  distribution,  the  FISP  has  also  improved  on  the 

targeting  of  beneficiaries  by  involving  the  community  through  the  Camp  Agriculture  Committees  in 

 
 

 

11 

selecting  beneficiaries  of  the  input  packs.  The  above  changes  have  led  to reduced  program  leakage  and 

incidences of farmers selling-off inputs. Table 1 below shows the performance of the FSP/FISP to date.

2.2.1.2 Food Security Pack Programme (FSP) 
 

The FSP programme is meant “to improve crop productivity and household food security among targeted 

vulnerable and viable households and thereby contribute to poverty reduction”. 

During the period under review, the programme received a total of K10 billion from Government which 

supported 9,000 beneficiaries. Additionally, there was funding from the Africa Development Bank (ADB) 

amounting  to  K14.5  billion  which  supported  17,227.  Below  is  the  tabulation  showing  total  number  of 

beneficiaries by Province.

with small livestock such as goats and chickens in areas where conditions do not favour crop farming. For 

the  2008/09  Season,  the  Programme  was  implemented  in  25  districts.  A  total  of  500  goats  and  1,000 

village chickens were procured and distributed by district Committees. Each beneficiary received  a she-

goat  or  two  hens.  As  a  result  of  this  programme,  beneficiaries  have  come  to  realize  the  commercial 

importance of livestock and poultry. Farmers have adopted the concept of crop and livestock integration 

i.e. they use the proceeds from livestock to boost up crop enterprises from season to season and vice versa 

hence  there  is  that  interdependence  of  the  enterprises.  The  Programme  also  has  business  and  marketing 

training modules that have been conducted in Central and Southern provinces where livestock marketing

centers  have  been  constructed.  Table  3  below  shows  the  distribution  of  poultry  and  livestock  in  target 

provinces.

bags of weighing 396.25 metric tonnes. This represents about 78 percent of the expected recovery. About 

22  percent  constituted  losses  in  the  recoveries  through  defaulting  by  beneficiaries.  Most  of  the  maize 

recoveries were kept in grain banks for future use. These grain banks act as a revolving avenue for others 

who  might  not  have  benefited  in  the  past.  Furthermore,  these  grain  banks  are  used  for  household  food 

security during times of climatic shocks. 

 

2.2.2.  Crop Production, Food Supply and Access 
According to MACO estimates, the production of major staple food crops such as maize, sorghum, rice, 

groundnuts, Irish potatoes, mixed beans, sweet potatoes and cassava increased in the 2009/10 agricultural 

season when compared to the previous season. Total maize production in the 2009/10 agricultural season 

increased by 48 percent (908,473 MT), from 1,887,010 MT in the 2008/2009 season to 2,795,483 MT in 

the 2009/2010 season.

** Data not available; not collected  

MACO  crop  estimates  however  revealed  a  reduction  in  the  production  of  small  grains  in  the  2009/10 

agricultural season. The production of wheat which had increased by 72% in the 2008/09 season decrease 

by 12% in the 2009/10 agriculture season, from 195,456MT to 172,256MT (wheat is planted in May and 

harvested in August/September). The decrease in production was largely a result of lowered demand for 

local wheat by private sector which alternatively sought to import cheaper wheat flour from South Africa 

in the 2008/09 season. A substantial amount of the local wheat produced in the 2008/09 season therefore 

remained unsold several months after the harvest, and was carried over into the 2009/10 marketing season. 

There was however a 27% increase in the quantity of sorghum produced, from 21,829MT in the 2008/09 

season to 27,732MT in the 2009/10 season (Table 6).

2.2.3.  National Food Supply for the 2008/09 Marketing Season 

 
Zambia  has,  at  the  national  level,  produced  adequate  maize  to  meet  the  country’s  consumption 

requirements  for the 2010/11  marketing season.  This  implies that no  maize  imports will  be required  for 

commercial  or  relief  purposes.  Optimum  annual  maize  requirements  for  all  uses  including  human 

consumption  and  industrial  use  as  well  as  unofficial  cross-border  trade  and  national  strategic  grain 

reserves for the 2010/2011 marketing year (1st May 2010 to 30th April 2011) are estimated at 2,008,455 

Mt.  When  requirements  are  netted  out  of  availability,  the  total  maize  supply  is  estimated  to  exceed 

domestic requirement by 1,085,709 Mt (Table 5), an exportable surplus which is all non-GMO.  

 

Similar to past years, sorghum, millet and cassava production are adequately available to meet domestic 

requirements this year (Table 7). An estimated 10, 352 MT of rice will be required to meet the shortfall in 

line with previous years.

In  the  past,  during  seasons  of  staple  food  deficits,  Zambia  has  restricted  the  export  of  maize  grain  and 

maize  meal.  Following  a  significant  increase  in  maize  output  during  the  2009/10  agricultural  season, 

Government  has  this  year,  without  compromising  national  food  security,  encouraged  maize  exports, 

targeting  both  the  regional  market  and  beyond.  Also,  in  order  to  stabilize  the  price  of  local  maize, 

government  is  exploring  ways  of  ensuring  that  FRA  is  sufficiently  funded  so  as  to  increase  its 

participation in the market.  

In  view  of  the  increased  local  maize  supply,  informal  exports  to  neighbouring  DRC  are  expected  to 

significantly rise above the levels that prevailed during the previous marketing season.  

Although  at  national  level,  the  food  supply  situation  has  improved,  there  are  areas  in  some  of  the 

monitored  districts  which  will  require  some  intervention.  Based  on  the  findings  from  the  district  staff, 

excessive rainfall and in some cases prolonged dry spells resulted in reduced production in these areas.

2.2.4 Food Access 

 
Following  the  increased  supply  of  the  major  food  crops  such  as  maize,  sorghum  and  cassava  on  the 

market  and  the  reported  surpluses  in  all  these  crops,  combined  with  falling  prices  of  the  commodities, 

many  households  and  communities  are  guaranteed  of  improved  access  to  food.  With  the  new  harvest 

reaching the market and increasing the already good supply levels, supply has surpassed demand forcing 

prices  to  fall  substantially.  Localized  areas  which  may  have  had  reduced  harvests  will  be  able  to 

adequately  source  staple  food  from  neighbouring  communities  and  consumers  will  benefit  from  the 

expected lower prices. The Food Reserve Agency has announced an indicative minimum  maize price of 

ZMK1, 300/Kg, though it is highly unlikely that this price will hold (especially with the private buyers) in 

the  midst  of  a  large  maize  production.  The  maize  prices  are  more  likely  to  reflect  the  supply/demand 

situation as the market will become a buyer’s market this season. While maize meal prices are decreasing, 

falling maize grain prices will inevitably lower meal prices within the next few months.

development.  All  sectors,  amongst  others,  agriculture,  mining,  industry,  housing  and  energy  require 

access to adequate water and sanitation services for their development.  

To implement the sub sector activities, the government continues to  implement the National Rural Water 

Supply  and  Sanitation  Programme  (NRWSSP)  and  the  National  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation 

Programme whose main objective is to provide sustainable and equitable access to safe water supply and 

proper sanitation to meet basic needs for improved health and poverty alleviation for Zambia’s rural and 

urban population and contribute to achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for water 

and sanitation.  

Other  programmes  that  the  Government  continues  to  implement  are  the  National  Solid  Waste 

management Programme whose objective is to facilitate improved environmental management and reduce 

sanitation  diseases  through  collection  and  management  of  solid  waste  and  construction  of  toilets;  the 

Water  Resources  Action  Programme  (WRAP)  whose  overall  objective  is  to  ensure  that  Zambia’s  water 

resources  are  managed  and  utilised  for  maximum  social  and  economic  benefit  in  an  equitable  and 

sustainable manner with strong stakeholder participation;  and the National Water Supply and Sanitation 

Council (NWASCO), a regulatory body for urban WSS that also issues licenses to all urban water supply 

and sanitation service providers in Zambia. The Department of Water Affairs, which is being reformed by 

the  WRAP process, carries out water assessment programmes  for development of ground water and the 

development of surface water sources through dam construction, rain water harvesting and protection of 

springs and also monitors the development of water resources in the country through the Integrated Water 

Resource Management Plan (IWRMP).   

As at 2006 about 41 percent of Zambians did not have access to safe, reliable and convenient quantities of 

water and adequate sanitation. The major challenges faced by the sector are the growing demand for water 

and  sanitation  services.  Poor  integrated  water  resources  management  is  also  a  major  challenge  in  the 

sector.  

In order to address the challenges in the sector, focus has been primarily on increasing access to safe water 

and improved sanitation. This will be achieved through effective integrated water resources management 

and investment in water and sanitation infrastructure.  

 
 

 

22 

The  sector  particularly  registered  improvement  in  the  percentage  of  the  population  with  access  to  safe 

water  and  adequate  sanitation.  Coverage  for  2006  was  at  58  per  cent  from  37  per  cent  in  2004  while 

access to sanitation declined from 70 per cent in 2004 to 64 per cent in 2006.  

The performance of the sector has been moderate towards achieving its goals. While there has been some 

progress made in programmes, a number of challenges are being faced during implementation including 

seasonal  droughts  and  floods  arising  from  varying  rainfall  amounts  and  patterns.  Flood  damages  due  to 

small  rivers’  inundation  and  inadequate  drainage  systems  occur  during  the  rainy  season.  Rural 

communities (people, livestock, crops, and infrastructure) are the most vulnerable to floods, especially in 

the flood plains, valleys and near small rivers that are prone to flash flooding.  

Currently, the 2010  Water Policy  and the  Decentralization Implementation Plan  have  been  approved by 

Cabinet. These guide the effective implementation of the water and sanitation programmes. 

2.4 Health 

  

 The  critical  impact  of  health  on  national  development  cannot  be  overstated  and  therefore  health  care 

delivery  remains  a  top  priority  of  the  Zambian  government.  According  to  the  2008  Ministry  of  Health 

Annual  Report,  the  Ministry  of  Health  recorded  several  achievements  in  its  quest  to  ensure  equity  of 

access  to  cost-effective  quality  health  care  services  as  close  to  the  family  as  possible.  However,  the 

country still had some disease burden to deal with. 

 

The top ten causes of health facility visitation for all age groups in the annual health statistical bulletin of 

2008 were the same as those recorded in 2007. These were  malaria (252/1000), respiratory Infection (non 

pneumonia) (198/1000), diarrhoea (non  bloody) (69/1000), trauma (47/1000), skin Infections (38/1000), 

muscular  skeletal  and  connective  tissue,  eye  infection  (31/1000)  respiratory  infections  (pneumonia) 

(30.8), skin infection (30.5/1000) and ear, nose /throat infection (27/1000). 

 

Progress  was  made  in  the  area  of  disease  prevention  and  mitigation  with  a  reduction  in  the  nationwide 

malaria  parasite  prevalence  from  22%  in  2006  to  10%  in  2008.  The  National  Malaria  Control  Centre 

continued to scale-up Malaria interventions through: 

i.  Prevention  of  malaria  in  pregnancy  by  distributing  Insecticide  Treated  Nets(ITNs)  to  ante-natal 

mothers (874,293) national wide  

ii.  Scale up of Indoor Residual Household Spray(IRHS) to 36 districts 

 
 

 

23 

iii.  Conducting of  entomological and parasitological surveys in the 10 sentinel survey districts 

iv.  And  strengthening  of  case  management,  improved  availability  of  anti-malaria  drugs  and  diagnostic 

facilities with emphasis on Rapid Diagnostic Testing Kits (RDTs). 

 

The 2008 Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) results showed ITN coverage as follows:

Child health programmes also progressed well with the percentage of fully immunized children under the 

age  of  one  increasing  from  86%  in  2007  to  90%  in  2008.  Health  worker  training  in  Integrated 

Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) was also scaled up. Increase was also noted in ARV uptake 

by HIV  infected  infants  from 17%  in 2007 to 29%  in 2008. Pediatric  Anti- Retro Viral Therapy (ART) 

uptake increased from a cumulative total of 12,000 to 18,040. 

 

Under the Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care plan (EmONC), 18 districts will be strengthened each 

year.  The  plan  also  involves  staff  training,  infrastructure  maintenance  and  provision  of  equipment. 

Currently EmONC has been scaled up in at least two districts in all the nine provinces of Zambia. 

 

The  continued  scale-up  of  Highly  Active  Anti-Retro  Viral  Therapy  (HAART)  provision  has  resulted  in 

the number of ART centres increasing from 197 in 2007 to 419 in 2008. In addition to the ART centres, 

there  are  a  number  of  VCT  centres  run  by  NGOs  and  faith  based  organization.  These  two  factors 

contributed  to  the  observed  increase  in  the  number  of  clients  accessing  ART  from  156,783  in  2007  to 

219,576 in 2008. With the continued integration of Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission(PMTCT) 

programs into routine reproductive health services the number of HIV positive mothers accessing PMTCT 

services rose from 58,577 in 2007 to 69 963 in 2008. 

 

Drug availability like is an important component in the delivery of good and quality health services. The 

demand  for  provision  of  quality  health  services  is  determined  by  among  other  factors,  availability  of 

essential drugs, qualified medical personnel, supplies and equipment.  

 
 

 

24 

 

The Ministry of Health Annual Report for 2008 shows that there was a slight decline in the percentage of 

drug availability in health centres from 70 % in 2007 to 69 % in 2008, while the percentage of availability 

of  drug  in  hospitals  declined  from  84  %  in  2008  to  77  %  in  2008.  The  drug  kit  utilization  for  all  the 

provinces however showed an increase from 0.75 in 2007 to 0.95 in 2008. Regardless of these fluctuations 

in the availability and utilization of drugs in the health sector the Ministry of Health has not relented in the 

continued procurement and supply of essential drugs, health centre kits and community health worker kits 

to all the districts in the country. 

 

2.5. Nutrition  
 

More  than  a  third  of  deaths  of  children  under  the  age  of  five  years  and  disability-adjusted  life  years 

worldwide can be attributed to under nutrition, making it the largest risk factor in any age group for global 

burden  of  disease  (Black  et.al,  2008).    Under  nutrition  encompasses  stunting,  wasting,  underweight  and 

deficiencies  of  essential  vitamins  and  minerals  (micronutrients).    Stunting,  severe  wasting  and  intra 

uterine growth restrictions are together estimated to be responsible for 2.2 million deaths and 21% of the 

Disability - Adjusted Life - Years (DALYs) for children under five years (Ibid.).  Deficiencies of vitamin 

A  and  zinc  were  estimated  to  be  responsible  for  0.6  million  and  0.4  million  deaths  respectively  and  a 

combined  9%  global  childhood  DALYs  worldwide.    Furthermore,  sub-optimal  breastfeeding  was 

estimated to be responsible for 1.4 million child deaths and 10% of DALYs in children under five years 

(Ibid.).    Therefore,  good  nutrition  is  a  prerequisite  for  economic  development  (Victoria  et.al,  2008).  

Furthermore,  undernourished  children  are  more  likely  to  be  stunted  into  adulthood,  have  lower 

educational  achievements  and  give  birth  to  smaller  infants.    Maternal  and  child  under  nutrition  are  also 

associated with lower economic status with effects that spill over to future generations.    It is also worth 

noting  that  the  time  from  pregnancy  to  24  months  of  age  presents  a  crucial  window  of  opportunity  for 

reducing  under  nutrition  and  its  adverse  effects”  (Bryce  J.  et.  al.  2008).    Programme  efforts  should 

therefore focus on this segment of continuum of care.  

In Zambia, despite improvements in the levels of stunting and underweight from 47% and 28% in 2001 to 

45% and 15% in 2007 respectively (CSO, 2009), under nutrition remains a serious public health concern.  

In rural and urban areas stunting has declined from 51% in 2001-2 to 42% in 2007 and from 37% to 33% 

respectively during the same reference period (Ibid.). Stunting signifies long term deprivation of adequate 

nutrition  and  may  be coupled with recurrent and  chronic  illnesses.   Acute  malnutrition (wasting)  levels, 

 
 

 

25 

however, have remained the same (5%).   Wasting reflects current inadequate food intake and/or current 

illness, while underweight is a composite of both short and long term nutritional inadequacies.   

 

Micronutrient malnutrition arising from the deficiencies of vitamin A, iodine, iron and zinc are most likely 

to  co-exist  with  other  forms  of  under  nutrition  discussed  above.    According  to  the  NFNC,  54%  of  all 

children fewer than five years were vitamin A deficient, whereas 53% were iron deficient in 2003 (NFNC, 

2003).  These prevalences are of public health concern as they are well above the WHO cut-off points of 

10%.    For  vitamin  A  deficiency,  this  can  largely  be  attributed  to  inadequate  dietary  intake  of  the 

micronutrient.  Iron deficiency on the other hand, is a result of inadequate dietary intake as well as public 

health  problems  such  as,  high  malaria  incidence,  worm  infestations  and  bilharzia.    The  government  of 

Zambia  has  put  in  place  interventions  including  vitamin  A  and  iron  supplementation  programmes  for 

vulnerable groups to include children and women of reproductive age group to alleviate the problem.     

 

Breastfeeding, in particular exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a child’s life, is one of the 

key strategies for child survival both in the general population as well as in the context of HIV.  There has 

been an improvement in the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the general population from 41% in 2002 to 

61%  in  2007  (CSO,  2009).    Following  exclusive  breastfeeding,  the  timely  introduction  of  adequate 

complementary  foods with continued breastfeeding up to 24 months or beyond  is cardinal  for continued 

proper growth, development and child survival.  There has been an increase in the proportion of mothers 

who  introduce  complementary  foods  to their  infants  aged  between  6  and  9  months  of  age  from  87%  in 

2001/2 to 93.7% in 2009 (CSO, 2003/9).     

 

The  prevalence  of  the  afore-mentioned  forms  of  under  nutrition  are  likely  to  be  more  pronounced  in 

emergency and disaster situations where household livelihoods are disrupted, There is therefore a need for 

interventions and social safety nets to alleviate the negative consequences for vulnerable disaster affected 

populations.  

 
 
2.6. Education 
 
Although Education  has always  been considered  as a  factor of personal and  national development, over 

the  last  15  years  education  in  Zambia  has  exhibited  fairly  low  growth.  This  is  manifested  in  low 

progression  rate,  high  dropout  rate,  low  gross  and  net  enrolment  ratios,  and  the  general  plummeting 

 
 

 

26 

quality.  Of  clear  concern  to  all  stakeholders  in  the  provision  of  education,  is  the  need  to  meet  the 

challenge of education for all (EFA), with the perfect intention of maximizing quality over quantity.  

 

The  vision  of  the  policy  has  been  translated  into  strategies  which  are  being  implemented  through  the 

National implementation Framework (NIF) for education covering spells of 5 years, the first being 2005 

to  2010  and  the  current  covering  2010  to  2015  under  the  bigger  national  plan  of  the  Fifth  National 

Development (FNDP) plan and the sixth National Development plans.  

 

The current Zambia national education policy document “Educating our Future”, laid down a clear vision 

for reforms of the whole education sector focusing on: 

• 

Increasing access to quality education for all at all levels of the education system; 

•  Achieving high pupil retention, and progression and completion rates with emphasis on girls and 

the poor and vulnerable; 

•  Supplying adequate trained and motivated teachers and lecturers for all levels;  

•  Reviewing  the  curriculum  at  basic,  high  school  and  tertiary  levels  to  provide  relevant  skills  and 

knowledge; 

•  Supplying sufficient learning/teaching materials for all levels; 

•  Effective decentralization of education delivery, and; 

•  Management/mitigation of HIV/AIDS. 

 

The government’s thrust on education is to achieve increased and equitable access to quality education at 

all  levels  through  a  variety  of  policy  decisions,  initiatives  /  strategies  and  programmes,  which  are  well 

articulated  in  the  Strategic  Plan  include  the  abolition  of  schools  fees,  support  to  alternative  modes  of 

delivery, introduction of bursaries to carter for the most vulnerable. The MoE has prepared the National 

Implementation Framework (NIF) to guide the translation of these policy decisions and programmes into 

activities aimed at achieving national policy on education “Educating Our Future.” 

 

As a realization of the MDGs where universal primary education for all is emphasized, government seems 

to be doing  a  lot towards achieving this,  but a  lot of work still  needs to be done, especially  in the  rural 

areas. 

 

Zambia has 8,013 schools classified as basic, 583 schools classified as secondary, 14 training colleges and 

3 public universities (Education statistics bulletin 2007). Additionally there are 2,716 community schools, 

 
 

 

27 

initiated, developed and run by communities with minimal support from the government and development 

organizations.  These  community  schools  though  not  fully  supported  by  the  government  are  expected  to 

follow the school curriculum. 

 

The  total  school  enrolment  for  grades  1  to  9  in  2006  was  2,  986,  781  while  in  2007  it  was  3,  166,310 

representing an increase of 6%. The enrolment for grades 10 to 12 in 2006 was 193, 843 while in 2007 it 

was 219,132 representing an increase of 13% (Education Statistics, 2007). It is important to note that there 

has  been  a  marked  increase  in  enrolment  due  to  the  introduction  of  free  primary  education  and 

improvement  in  quality  of  school  buildings  (Education  Statistics,  2007).  The  number  of  out  of  school 

children has been declining since 2000. According to the 2007 Education Statistics bulletin, the number of 

out of school children in the 7-18 years age group were 65, 185 males and 173, 380 females representing 

6.7 % of the total population.  

 

The Ministry of Education has divided infrastructure in three categories namely permanent, temporary and 

incomplete structures. The permanent structures are structures built with concrete that can serve for many 

years,  usually  at  high  cost  using  skilled  labour  and  quality  materials.  The  temporary  structures  are 

temporal in nature built as stop gap measure to provide basic infrastructure. The incomplete structures are 

designed  to  be  permanent  structures  but  are  still  under  construction  and  are  often  already  in  use  before 

completed. 

 

Under the National Implementation Framework(NIF) of the FNDP, the Ministry of education in the year 

2008 commenced the construction of an average of 1700 classrooms at basic school level annually until 

the  year  2015  and  100  high  schools  (600  pupils  capacity)  to  reduce  the  deficit  in  the  numbers  of 

classrooms and both levels.  

 

The  Ministry  has  started  to  partner  with  the  private  sector  and  other  organizations  in  the  provision  of 

infrastructure  at  all  the  levels  of  education  provision  i.e.  Early  Childhood  Care  and  Education 

Development (ECCED), Basic School, High School and Tertiary levels.

2.7. Social Protection 
 
The Social Protection Sector aims to protect and promote the livelihoods and welfare of the critically poor 

and  of  people  with  the  greatest  vulnerability  to  adverse  impact  of  risks  and  shocks  so  that  they  have 

sufficient livelihood security to meet their basic needs.  

 

Among  other  things,  vulnerability  can  be  characterized  as  lacking  human  capital,  or  lacking  productive 

capital.  Social  protection  activities  often  address  the  lack  of  productive  capital  by  targeting  people  who 

lack human capital as well as productive assets. Since most households that have deficits in human capital 

are often marginalized from development opportunities, social protection therefore provides for deficits in 

basic  needs,  and  build  appropriate  and  sustainable  coping  strategies  and  livelihood  mechanisms.  Social 

protection  activities  may  seek  to  assist  such  households  to  cope  at  a  ‘crisis  point’,  or  may  alternatively 

intervene  strategically  to  prevent  or  mitigate  the  impacts  of  risk,  shock  and  shifting  vulnerabilities.  In 

addition, related cause and effects to vulnerability include; gender based violence, human trafficking and 

forced labour which has risen in the resent past. 

 

In view of the above, social protection programmes are targeted to reach priority groups exposed to key 

risks, shocks and shifting vulnerabilities. Whether aimed at promotion or prevention, social protection is 

always specifically targeted at key vulnerable groups, forming part of the poverty reduction process, and 

complementing broad based National programmes. 

 

The apparent need  for social protection  in Zambia  is clear: there are high  levels of extreme poverty and 

vulnerability,  which  are  maintained  through  the  multiple  effects  of  HIV  and  AIDS,  poverty, 

unemployment and repeated natural calamities such as drought and floods.  The HIV and AIDS rates are 

more prevalent among women compared to men. This feminization of the HIV and AIDS prevalent rate 

has been among others perpetuated by gender based violence, failure to negotiate condom use and limited 

economic opportunities for women. As a result, grandparents have become major care givers for Orphans 

and Vulnerable Children, experiencing increasing challenges in raising income and providing care as they 

grow older. In an emergency situation, the risks and shocks or forces caused by natural calamities tend to 

worsen  the  vulnerability  of  individuals  and  communities  since  the  resources,  assets  or  support 

mechanisms  they  depend  on  are  affected  by  these  disasters.    Furthermore,  many  able  bodied  men  and 

women  of  working  age  are  left  without  jobs,  and  thereby  competing  with  people  from  low  capacity 

households for marginal income opportunities, public works and charity. 

 

 
 

 

29 

Some of the Social Protection Interventions in Zambia include the following:- 

i.  Food  Security  Pack:  Under  this  programme  farming  inputs  shall  be  provided  to  vulnerable  but 

viable  farmers  at  household  level  to  enhance  food  security  through  crop  diversification, 

conservation  farming,  promotion  of  micro  credit  facilities,  and  alternative  livelihoods.  This  will 

greatly  contribute  to  increased  productivity  of  crop  yields,  livestock  and  household  assets  for 

people in disaster prone areas. 

  

ii.  Public  Welfare  Assistance  Scheme  (PWAS):  This  is  government’s  major  social  assistance 

programme  aimed  at  assisting  the  incapacitated  households  in  order  to  reduce  hunger,  extreme 

poverty  and  destitution.  Under  PWAS  beneficiaries  will  be  assisted  with  education,  health  and 

social  support.  The  PWAS  programme  is  unique  because  it  uses  a  community  based  approach 

when targeting and implementing the scheme. A system which other programmes both locally and 

regionally have adopted and implemented. 

iii.  Social Cash Transfers: The Social Cash Transfers (SCT) are regular non-contributory payments 

or  money  provided  to  incapacitated  and  extremely  poor  individuals  or  households  in  a  given 

community. This scheme  is an  efficient and cost effective  mechanism  for assisting  incapacitated 

households  and  strengthening  communities’  resistance  to  vulnerability  as  beneficiaries  use  the 

cash  for  nutrition,  access  to  services,  savings  and  small  investments.  Additionally,  the  SCT 

scheme  has  a  multiplier  effect  on  the  community  as  there  is  direct  investment  in  the  local 

economies as the beneficiaries spend the money procuring goods from the local environment there 

by  promoting  local  enterprise.  Results  under  this  scheme  show  that  individuals  and  households 

accessing  SCTs  have  seen  notable  improvements  in  their  livelihoods,  increased  consumption 

levels in terms of food, investment in education, health as well as reduced destitution. 

 

iv.  Child Protection; is aimed at addressing the plight of children including those found on the street 

by  providing  adequate  legal  and  social  protection  such  as  shelter,  education,  food  etc  to  these 

children  living  in difficult circumstances or  in  need of care.  Further, Government will construct 

state owned and state-run children homes. In terms of implementation there is an urgent need for 

coordination  and  collaboration  among  all  stakeholders  involved  in  child  protection  programmes 

for effective rehabilitation and reintegration of children in need of care. 

30 

 

 

 
 

 

The Ministry of Community Development and Social Services (MCDSS) will continue with the mandate 

of  managing  and  coordinating  all  official  social  protection  activities  within  the  country  in  collaboration 

with  its  stakeholders.  The  Government  recognizes  that  more  needs  to  be  done;  to  support  the  effective 

implementation of social protection strategies and a number of key policy and institutional reforms will be 

put in place.  

 

2.8. Human Habitation and Shelter 
 

Shelter  is  a  basic  need  for  all  as  it  provides  personal  security  and  protection  from  adverse  climatic 

conditions and enhances resistance to disease and  ill  health. About 65% of Zambian  households occupy 

traditional  housing  units  (LCMS,  2004).  In  Zambia,  73%  of  the  population  is  poor  or  extremely  poor 

while in the rural areas, 71% of people live in extreme poverty, twice as many as in urban areas (SARPN, 

2008). In rural Zambia, 91% of the households occupy traditional houses while in urban areas this stands 

at 22%. 

 

Human settlements and shelter get affected by hazards of various kinds and at times destroyed depending 

on the  severity  of  the  hazard.  The  vulnerability  of  the  settlements  and  shelter,  human  life,  property  and 

infrastructure to flood disasters  is worse  in rural  areas due to the poor, inappropriate and weak  building 

materials (mainly pole, mud and grass) used in building traditional houses. 

 

Whenever  floods  occur,  an  average  of  10%  of  the  affected,  require  relocation  and/or  resettling  as  their 

settlements and shelter get damaged and in some cases they are completely destroyed. These are mostly in 

rural  areas,  where  poverty  levels  are  higher  and  communities  are  less  resilient  to  effects  of  floods.  The 

government  would  do  well  to  implement  a  fast  truck  transmigration  programme  where  communities 

settled in flood prone areas would voluntarily be resettled to higher and safer lands to avoid the repeated 

experience of  same communities  being affected each time  floods occur. This would  lessen  vulnerability 

and  enhance  improved  living  conditions  of  vulnerable  communities,  as  well  as  reduce  pressure  on 

government emergency response, rescue and support.  

 

The rationale for the implementation of the transmigration programme needs to be based on the benefits 

of  long  term  prevention  mechanism  as  opposed  to  short-term  solutions  to  immediate  needs  of  flood 

disaster victims.

Infrastructure 

2.9.  
 
The  Six  National  Development  Plan  places  infrastructure  development  as  one  of  the  key  sectors  apart 

from  Agriculture  that  would  drive  the  Zambian  Economy  to  meet  the  vision  2030.  Development  of 

infrastructure is also one of the key poverty reduction mechanisms that the government has put in place to 

contribute  towards  improving  the  living  conditions  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  communities.  Most  of 

Zambia’s  major  road  infrastructure  was  constructed  in  the  1970s.  The  age  of  the  drainage  facilities 

(culverts  &  bridges)  coupled  with  vandalism  (mostly  on  corrugated  metal  ARMCO  pipes)  effects  have 

resulted  in  considerable  damage  from  inclement  weather.  The  condition  of  roads,  bridges  and  culverts 

have  become  generally  bad.  The  country  has  for  the  past  three  consecutive  seasons  experienced  floods 

which have had an impact on infrastructure.  

 

The  country  depends  mainly  on  gravel  and  feeder  roads  connecting  districts  and  wards  to  each  other 

especially  in  rural  areas.  This  is  a  vital  and  strategic  link  for  the  supply  of  goods  and  services  to  the 

communities in various parts of the country. Government has encouraged the establishment of schools and 

health  centers  in  the  rural  areas  through  community  development  programmes  such  as  rehabilitation  of 

existing infrastructure. According to the LCMS (2004), the most widespread infrastructure projects in the 

rural areas are rehabilitation/resurfacing of roads, provision and improvement of education infrastructure 

and  health  facilities.  However  despite  all  this,  most  of  the  infrastructure  especially  in  the  educational 

sector remains in a poor state as most community schools are built from pole and mud. 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 

32 

3.0. FINDINGS   
  
3.1. General Demographics  
 

The  survey  showed  that  eighty  seven  percent  (87%)  of  the  area  in  the  fifteen  (15)  districts  were  rural. 

Most of the households in these districts were male headed and fell in the age group of 19 to 37 years (56 

%). Female headed households made up 23% of the number of households in the seventeen districts while 

child  headed  households  made  up  a  meager  0.8%.  The  age  range  for  the  child  headed  households  was 

between  11  and  18  years.  Households  that  were  managed  by  elderly  people  above  the  age  of  57  years 

made up 19% of the population in the 15 districts. 

 

The  survey  further  established  that  most  of  the  household  heads  in  the  surveyed  districts  had  at  least 

primary  education  or  better.  Those  that  indicated  to  have  primary  education  made  up  52%  of  the 

population  while  38%  indicated  to  have  attained  secondary  education.  A  further  6%  indicated  to  have 

attained tertiary education while the remainder had never been to school. 

  

It was also established that 73.1% of the household  heads were  married while 10.5%  indicated as being 

widowed. A small number (3%) indicated having been separated. The survey further established that the 

average  family  size  for  the  surveyed  area  was  six  which  was  in  line  with  the  findings  of  some  of  the 

national surveys such as the Living Conditions Monitoring Survey (LCMS, 2004). 

 

The  In-depth  assessment  survey  conducted  in  fifteen  (15)  districts  established  that  a  total  of  238,258 

people (39,710  households) were  negatively  impacted upon  by the 2009/10  flood situation. It should  be 

emphasized that this figure represents the total number of people and households affected in one way or 

the other and does not in any way represent any sector based population.   

3.2. Preparedness Measures 
 

The assessment established that 22% of the households in the assessed districts were warned about the dry 

spell  and  flooding. The  majority of  households (87.9%) indicated that the early warning  messages were 

received from radio. These messages were mainly prepared and transmitted through electronic media by 

the  Zambia  Meteorological  Department  (42%).  Other  institutions  that  transmitted  warning  messages 

through the radio were the District Disaster Management Committee with about 32% of the  households 

indicating having gotten messages through this source.  

 

 
 

 

33 

From the  number of households receiving early  warning  messages,  it would  be  important to revamp the 

early warning systems and also find an effective way of passing such information to the public. It will be 

imperative to raise the number of people getting early warning messages. 

 

When asked what the households that had received the early warning  messages had done to prepare for 

the  hazard,  34%  indicated  having  stocked  up  food  in  preparation  for  the  eventuality.  A  further  26% 

indicated that they had relocated to another area after receiving flood warnings. 

  

3.3. Livelihoods, Incomes, Expenditure Patterns and Asset Ownership 
 

3.3.1. Livelihoods 
 

The main livelihood that the households in the survey districts engage in was determined to be agriculture 

with 84% indicating to be involved in the sector. About 38% of the households indicated that they were 

involved in cash crop production. Other households indicated engaging into the provision of casual labour 

(12%) as their mainstay. These provided labour to more well-off households. A further 7% indicated that 

they were fisher folks.  

 

Owing to the fact that the majority of households are involved in activities that rely on weather, the floods 

and  dry  spells  that  were  experienced  did  impact  their  sectors  negatively.  Agricultural  production,  for 

instance, recorded average crop losses at 30%.   

 

Other  livelihoods  that  the  households  indicated  as  being  involved  in  included  formal  salary  (8%)  and 

trading mainly involving small businesses (8%). The table below (Figure 6) shows the livelihoods which 

the households were involved in.

Figure 6: Household Main Livelihood Sources

done  between  the  2009/2010  agricultural  season  to  the  previous  season.  This  implies  a  stability  in  the 

income source and hence no exits from one livelihood to the other. 

 

3.3.3. Expenditure Patterns 
 

The  sampled  households  spent  their  money  on  Food,  rent,  Transport,  Alcohol,  water,  electricity, 

household  item,  health,  clothing,  debt  social  activities  and  education.  However  the  assessment  revealed 

that most of the sampled households spent their money on food compared to other non food items such as 

education and rent. The average amount of money spent on food was about K179, 000 per month followed 

by education (K121, 000), Transport (K71, 000) and clothing (K61, 000). Less was spent on water, rent 

and health as shown in Figure 7 below. 

 

Figure 7: Average Expenditure for Households on Various Items 

 

 
 

 

36 

other productive assets owned by households included fishing nets (12.7%) and canoes (11%). The survey 

also showed that the households did not off – load their household items as a mechanism to fill their daily 

requirements.  

 

Furthermore, most of the households in the surveyed districts are traditional livestock keepers. The kinds 

of  livestock  kept  included  cattle  with  24.8%  of  households  indicating  owning  some,  goats  owned  by 

13.4% of  households, sheep (0.5%) and pigs (7.4%). The  most commonly owned  livestock was poultry 

where 54.5% of households indicated having some kind of poultry. These kinds of livestock could serve 

as insurance for these households when things become difficult. 

 

3.4. Coping Strategies 
 

The  assessment  of  coping  strategies  was  done  from  the  consumption,  expenditure  and  incomes 

perspective. 

 

The assessment revealed that there was no significant change in the number of meals taken per day by the 

households  in  the  assessment  area.  About  51% of  the  households  indicated  taking  two  (2)  meals  a  day 

which is the number of meals taken normally (Figure 9). A small percentage of households (1%) indicated 

that they had more than three (3) meals a day. It can therefore be deduced that the communities are taking 

the normal number of meals and are therefore not under any stress.

3.3. Agriculture and Food Security 
 

3.3.1 Household Food Security 
In  all  the  seventeen  districts  surveyed,  84%  of  households  continued  to  depend  on  farming  activities  as 

their mainstay for food security. The survey showed that the production of all the major staple food crops 

such as maize, sorghum, millet, rice and cassava generally continued to expand in most of these districts.  

Of these staple crops grown, maize was the  most commonly grown with 76.7 percent of the households 

reporting  growing  the  crop.  The  other  staples  grown  included  rice  which  stood  at  10.6  %,  followed  by 

millet (8.9 %) and sorghum (6.9 %). Cassava was not widely grown in most of the districts. 

 

3.3.2 Access to Arable Land  
Approximately 84 % of the  households  in the assessed districts  indicated that they  had access to arable 

land.  Of these  households, 28%  indicated that they  had access to more than 2  hectares of  land  while a 

similar proportion (27%) had access to between 0.5 to 1 hectares of land.

3.3.2. Market Situation 

 

The results of the assessment  indicate that maize  prices  in 6 of the  assessed districts remained  stable or 

decreased  in  May  2010,  as  compared  to  the  situation  in  May  2009  (Figure  12).    The  highest  price 

decreases were observed in Mongu and Shang’ombo districts, where maize prices decreased by 27% and 

16%  respectively.  Price  levels  remained  stable  in  Kafue  and  Sesheke  districts  in  the  same  reference 

period.  However,  in  Lukulu  observed  maize  prices  in  May  2010  were  17%  higher  than  prices  in  May 

2009, while prices in Serenje and Mambwe districts were 10% higher than the previous season’s prices. 

This may be attributed to the fact that although a significant maize surplus was realized in the last 2008/09 

agriculture  season,  maize  prices  remained  exceptionally  high  in  the  2009/10  consumption  season. 

Furthermore,  price  increases  were  observed  in  the  lean  season  from  November,  2009  to  January,  2010. 

The May 2010  maize prices reported therefore best reflect the end of the previous  market stocks on the 

market  and  partly  the  extent  to  which  the  households  are  accessing  food  from  own  production  in  the 

assessed districts.  

 
 

 
 

 

40 

than  they  were  in  December  2009.  The  highest  increase  was  seen  in  Serenje  district  where  prices 

increased by approximately 31% from ZMK1, 950,000 per animal in December 2009 to ZMK 2,550,000 

in May 2010.  Cattle prices in Kafue, Gwembe and Namwala districts also increased by 25% in the same 

time period. The increase in cattle prices during this time period suggests that in May 2010, most farmers 

in these areas were able to negotiate higher cattle prices and were not desperate to sell their cattle to meet 

food or other pressing needs.

these  areas  be  monitored  in  the  latter  months  of  the  year  when,  household  food  stocks  decline  and 

households turn to the markets for food purchases. 

 
3.4. Water and Sanitation 
 
3.4.1 Water 

 
3.4.1.1 Drinking Water at Household 
 

The  following  districts  were  sampled  to  arrive  at  the  conclusion  and  recommendations  made  for 

mitigation of the drought effects during the 2009/10 drought season; Serenje, Mambwe, Kafue, Luangwa, 

Chavuma, Gwembe, Kazungula, Namwala, Sinazongwe, Kalabo, Lukulu, Mongu, Senanga, Sesheke and 

Shangombo.  

A  total  of  3,065  water  sources  were  surveyed  of  which  a  huge  portion,  43%  (1,328)  was  found  to  be 

unsafe.

The most commonly used water source for domestic purposes is the borehole with hand pump at 37.5% 

and 13.4 % of these were affected by the flood indicating a drop in communities with access to safe water 

sources.  Nevertheless  it  is  revealed  that  these  water  sources  are  within  100-150m  distance  to  the 

households and therefore are accessible when not affected by the flooding. 

The  quality  of  water  among  the  sources  most  used  for  domestic  purposes  is  69.8%  good  and  for  the 

sources  affected  by  floods,  drops  to  29.4%.  Floods  have  a  negative  effect  on  the  quality  of  water  even 

 
 

 

42 

though the source is protected. For these communities affected by floods, 51.6% had no alternative source 

and  the  communities  with  an  alternative  source  had  the  majority  of  them  collecting  water  from 

unprotected  wells.  The  effect  of  the  floods  therefore  is  to  force  communities  to  draw  water  from 

unprotected water sources and for others without an alternative source, to use the affected source whose 

quality of water drops drastically. 

 

The survey also revealed that 29.2 % of the communities treat their water. The methods of treatment are 

distributed as follows; by use of chlorine (24.2%), boiling (6.6%) and filtering (0.2%). This implies that a 

large  proportion  of  the  affected  communities  at  70.8  %,  use  potentially  unsafe  water.  This  is  also 

compounded by the fact that among the communities without access to safe water due to floods, only 57.7 

% have access to sanitary facilities as 40.4% of the facilities collapse due to the floods. Furthermore, only 

47.6% of the communities use soap when washing hands which is proven as a effective intervention in the 

spread of water borne diseases. 

 

3.4.2. Sanitation 
 
It  is  estimated  that  41.2%  of  the  sampled  communities  did  not  dispose  of  their  faecal  waste  in  a  safe 

manner and that the most common sanitary facilities for excreta disposal amongst the sampled households 

was the traditional pit latrine at 50.7%, flush toilets at 4.8%, VIP Latrine 1.3%, sanplat at 1.8%.

About 40.6% of the latrines collapsed due to the effect of the floods and 47.3% of the community does not 

wash their hand and of the 51.9% that do wash their hands, only 47.6% use soap. 

 
 

 

43 

Therefore, it is assumed because of the insanitary conditions created by the floods, the water borne disease 
patterns have increased and caused hardship for the affected communities 
 
 
3.5. Health 
 

The survey revealed that 81.3 % reported a household member being taken ill during the period January – 

March 2010. The assessment  further revealed that gender was  insignificant  in one  being sick during the 

same  period.  It  was  observed  that  in  all  districts  affected  by  floods,  over  60%  reported  a  household 

member having Clinical Malaria. The table below shows the prevalence of common illnesses by type of 

disease and location among households that had at least one sick member.

3.7.1. Socio-demographic characteristics of children included in the sample 
 
Of  the  children  assessed,  the  majority  were  in  the  range  of  12  to  23  months  age  group  (29.8%).  With 
regard to sex, there was an even distribution in the sample (Table 12).

3.7.2. Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices 
 
Breastfeeding Status 
  
The  government  policy  is  that  all  lactating  mothers  should  be  encouraged  and  supported to  exclusively 
breast  their  infants  for  the  first  six  months  of  their  life.    .Ccomplementary  foods  should  be  introduced 
therafter  and  breastfeeding  continued  up  to  2  years  or  beyond  if  possible.    About  33.5%  (n=548)  were 
breastfeeding at the time of the survey.  Results also showed that more children in the rural areas (34.1%) 
were still breastfeeding at the time of the survey compared to those from urban areas.  Furthermore, they 
were more children breastfeeding in the range of 12 to 23 months age group (Table 13 ).

In the three months preceding the survey only 6.6% (n=109) of the children assessed received therapeutic  

feeding;  2.2%  (n=35)  received  supplementary  feeding  and  1.5%  (n=24)  were  currently  on  a  therapeutic 

feeding programme.  

 

3.7.3 Nutritional status 

 

Children were assessed  for stunting, wasting and  underweight.  In addition, they  were also assessed  for 

the presence of bilateral oedema. Only 1.1%(n=17) of the children  were found to have bilateral oedema.   

 

Food security 
 

Household  dietary  diversity  information  on  11  food  groups:  cereals;  white  tubers;  yellow,  orange  and 

green  vegetables;  fruits;  meats;  eggs;  fish;  legumes;  milk  and  milk  products;  oils  and  fats;  and,  sugary 

foods  was  collected  through  a  7-day  recall  in  the  assessment.  Approximately  61.4  %  of  the  assessed 

 
 

 

50 

households reported having consumed up to four food groups in the 7 days preceeding the survey, while 

38.7% consumed five or more food groups.

               From WHO, 2003, “The Management of Nutrition in Major Emergencies” 

 

The  nutrition  status  of  1,643  children  was  assessed  in  the  15  districts.    Approximately  40.3%  of  the 

children assessed were stunted; 9.2% wasted;  16.5% underweight (Table 18).  The prevelence of severe 

stunting in the sample was 22.3%, while the prevalence of severe wasting and underweight were 5.6% and 

6.6% respectively.

Approximately 4.8 % of the children assessed were wasted, with 1.1% of them severely wasted.  A  total 

number  of  1,253  mothers  were  assessed  for  wasting  using  the  mid-  upper  arm  circumference  (MUAC) 

measure. Of the women assessed only 0.7%  had acute malnutrition. 

 
The results of the assesment indicated a prevalence of wasting of 9.2% among the children assessed. The 

prevalence of severe wasting was high in the sample at 5.6%.  Bilateral oedema was however low, with 

1.0%  of  the  children  being  affected.  The  results  of  the  assessment  therefore  indicate  a  global  acute 

malnutrition rate of 10.2% for the children assessed. It should noted that some of the observed increases in 

 
 

 

52 

severe malnutrition can be partially attributed to the change from the 1977 NCHS growth reference to the 

new WHO (2006) growth standards in the determination of child nutrition status4.

3.8. Education 
 

The survey showed that cases of dropping out of school due to floods were very minimal. Only 5.2% of 

households  in the  surveyed districts  indicated  having  children that had dropped out of  school. However 

the main reason attributed to this was that the parents could not afford to pay the school fees.  

 

Of the households reporting children dropping out of school for reasons other than school fees, over 3.7% 

reported having at least one child dropping out. The number of males dropping out of school was slightly 

higher than that for females.  

 

The other reason on the part of boys is that they were not just interested in education (0.6%) while 0.7% 

indicated that girls dropped out due to early marriages. 

 

The assessment established that 32 schools in 12 districts were damaged in one way or another and will 

require rehabilitation.

3.8. Social Protection 
 

The  social  protection  issues  considered  in  the  assessed  districts  were  violence  and  abuse,  Child  welfare 

and  HIV  prevalence.  The  most  common  cases  of  violence  and  abuse  in  order  of  ranking  were:  early 

marriages (23.6%), assault (19.4%), child defilement (7.6%), sexual exploitation (7.2%) and rape (5.2%) 

while there were no reported cases of other types of violence in the surveyed districts (Figure 21).

The findings of the survey as relates to orphan-hood indicated that the number of single orphaned children 

was high (54.8 %) compared to those who had lost both parents (18%) in the assessed districts.  

 
As  regards  the  reporting  mechanisms  for  these  vices,  the  assessment  revealed  that  there  were  reporting 

mechanisms in place in all the districts.  Most of the cases were reported to the police (73.2%). The other 

places where people reported were local authorities, the local health clinics and humanitarian    

organizations in order of importance.  

 

3.9. Human Habitation and Shelter 
 
The assessment revealed that out of all the flood affected households, only 5.6% (176) households were 

displaced. This translates to about 1,056 people. 

 

All  the  districts  that  were  surveyed  indicated  having  some  households  displaced  from  their  dwellings; 

Senanga  and  Serenje  were  the  worsed  affected  each  reporting  about  11.9%  of  households  as  having 

displaced.  The  other  badly  affected  districts  included  Mambwe  (9.7%)  and  Lukulu  (9.1%).    The 

breakdown per district is presented in table 23 below.

Over 70% of the displaced households owned and lived in traditional type of houses which are basically 

made of pole, mud and grass. This category was the most affected and these house types were prevalent in 

Shang’ombo,  Senanga,  Mongu  and  Lukulu.  The  next  most  affected  households  lived  in  improved 

traditional houses made of un-burnt bricks and grass. This category was prevalent in Serenje, Kafue, and 

Mambwe  and  Sinazongwe  districts  and  accounted  for  17%  of  the  displaced  households.  This  was 

followed  by  improved traditional  houses that were  made of  burnt bricks. The  figure  below  illustrates  in 

percentages the types of houses occupied by displaced houses.  

 

Figure 22: Types of Houses Occupied by Displaced Households

The  main  sources  of  livelihood  for  the  displaced  households  included  farming  (50%),  fishing  (11%), 

formal  employment (11%) and small  businesses (6, 3%). Some of the  farming and  fishing  communities 

were in low lying areas thus making them particularly vulnerable to these floods.

4. CONCLUSIONS   
 
The  assessment  established  that  a  total  of  238,258  people  (39,710  households)  were  affected  by  the 

2009/10  floods.  It  should  be  emphasized  that  this  figure  represents  the  total  number  of  people  and 

households  affected  in  one  way  or  the  other  and  does  not  in  any  way  represent  any  sector  based 

population.   

The sector specific conclusions are as follows:- 

4.1. Infrastructure 
 

The  assessment  established  that  there  was  significant  damage  done  to  roads,  health  and  school 

infrastructure.  About  344  road  and  drainage  structures  were  damaged  and  need  to  be  reinstated.  These 

structures include those that were not worked on from the previous season (Refer to the RDA technical 

report on the Washed away and affected Drainage structures by 2008/9 and 2009/10 rains).  The school 

and health infrastructure has been covered under the respective sectors. 

 

4.2. Agriculture and Food Security 

 

Overall,  agriculture  production  for the  2009/10  agriculture  season  has  performed  better than  in  2008/09 

season.  The  production  of  major  staple  food  crops  such  as  maize,  sorghum,  rice,  groundnuts,  Irish 

potatoes,  mixes  beans,  sweet  potatoes  and  cassava  increased  in  the  2009/10  agricultural  season  when 

compared  to  the  previous  season.  Maize  production  for  instance,  increased  sharply  by  48  percent  from 

1,887,010 MT in the 2008/2009 season to 2,795,483 MT in the 2009/2010 season. The increase in production 

has  inevitably  pushed  down  the  price  of  most  food  crops  especially  maize,  thereby  improving  access  to  the 

staple  food  for  most  households  and  communities.  Maize  production  has  increased  in  Serenje,  Kafue, 

Kazungula, Sinazongwe, Kalabo, Mongu and Senanga. However maize production has decreased in other 

districts such as Luangwa, Namwala, Lukulu and Sesheke. 

 

Based on maize production, the four (4) districts that experienced a reduction in the harvest of the main 

staple  will  therefore  need  to  be  targeted  for  intervention  to  sustain  the  livelihood  of  the  affected 

communities. 

 

 
 

 

59 

Despite  the  increase  in  maize  production  in  Mambwe,  Chavuma,  Gwembe,  and  Shang’ombo,  these 

districts  should  continue  to  be  monitored  because  these  districts  were  either  affected  by  floods  or 

prolonged dry spells.  

 

4.3. Nutrition 
 

The assessment revealed that about 37.6% of the children started receiving complementary foods before 

the age of six months and therefore, were not exclusively breastfed in the first six months.  This is a cause 

for  concern  for  vulnerable  households  as  the  introduction  of  other  foods  makes  the  children  more 

susceptible  to  illness  such  diarrhoea  which  may  lead  malnutrition.    In  addition,  children  in  vulnerable 

household are already exposed to other factors such as poor water and sanitation and inadequate access to 

health services that compromise their health and nutrition.  

   

The overall  vitamin  A supplentation  coverage of  71% for the districts assessed was  below the desirable 

national  target  of  80%  in  particular  for  Shangombo  (31.2%)  and  Sesheke  (46.9%).    Therefore,  there  is 

need to step up the efforts in order to increase the coverage.  

  

The coverage of supplementary and therapeutic feeding programmes was low across the districts assessed.   

This is a concern as some children requiring these services do not have access to these programmes and 

may  report  late  for  treatment.    Accessibility  to  these  services  should  be  increased  by  establishing 

interventions  such  as  Community  Based  Theraptic  Care  (CTC)  and  supplementary  feeding  programmes  

in the affected areas.  

  

The    results  of  the  assessment  revealed  that  stunting,  wasting  and  underweight  were  co-existing  in  the 

assessed  communities.  The  high  levels  of  malnutrition  observed  in  the  communities  assessed  can  be  

attributed to both chronic and  transient factors. The observed status quo is compounded by the exposure 

of communities in the assessed districts to shocks such as floods and dry spells. In addition to inadequate 

food intake, children in these communities are also from households exposed to high poverty levels with 

limited  access  to  health  and  education  services,  exercebating  an  already  fragile  situation.  There  is 

therefore a need for the implementation of both short and long term interventions to address the prevailing 

situation. 

 

 
 

 

60 

4.4. Water and Sanitation 
 

The  assessment  revealed  that  even  though  communities  have  access  to  protected  water  sources  in  the 

affected areas 56.7%, during floods, the access drops to 43.3% and the quality of water from the protected 

sources  within  the  affected  areas  drops  to      69.3  %.  It  is  therefore  necessary  to  consider  relocation  of 

communities within the risk areas as a long term solution. 

 

It is evident that communities are aware of the dangers of using unsafe water as 29.2% treat their  water 

through. Application of  chlorine,  boiling  and  awareness  needs to be created with regards to the use of 

soap for hand washing as only 48.6 %use soap when washing hands. 

It  is  also  clear  that  communities’  value  having  proper  latrines  as    57.7%  have  latrines  and  are  only 

inhibited by the fact that 13.4% of these collapse during floods. 

 

4.5. Health 
 

The  survey  found  that  69.2%  of  the  under  five  children  had  suffered  from  fever/suspected  malaria, 

diarrhoea  (watery  stool),  cough,  or  skin  infection  while  30.8%  did  not  suffer  from  any  illness.  The 

assessment  established  that  immunization  coverage  was  high  in  all  the  assessed  districts.  Fifteen  health 

centers in 9 districts were damaged. 

 

4.6. Education 
 

Analysis of the report has revealed that 94.5 % of the respondents did not have any boys dropping out and 

95.1%  of  the  respondents  did  not  have  girls  dropping  out  of  school.  Of  the  families  reporting  children 

dropping out, 3.7% reported one male child having dropped and the same percentage for female children. 

A fewer number of respondents equivalent to 1.3% reported 2 boys dropping out and 1% reported 2 girls 

dropping  out.  In  comparison  terms,  there  are  more  boys  dropping  out  of  school  than  girls.  The  main 

reason for boys dropping out of school was inability for the family to pay school fees (3.7%) followed by 

lack of  interest on the part of the  boy to continue school (0.6%). The boys who dropped out were  later 

engaged in work outside the family for cash. On the part of girls’ dropouts, 3.3% dropped out on account 

of the inability by the family to pay school fees, and 0.7% dropped out on account of early marriages. 

At  district  level,  Mambwe  reported  the  highest  number  of  boys  dropping  out  at  11.8%  followed  by 

Senanga with 9.1%, Mongu at 8.6% and Kalabo at 8.2%. Kalabo district reported the highest number of 

girls dropping out (9.6%) of school, followed by Mongu and Kafue at 8.1% and Mambwe at 7.6%. 

 
 

 

61 

About 32 schools in 12 districts were damaged in one way or another and will require rehabilitation. 

 

4.7. Social Protection 
 

The cases of gender based violence and abuse as well as the plight of children in areas that experienced 

floods and dry spells in the fifteen (15) districts that were assessed is an issue of concern. There is lack of 

safety  awareness  among  the  communities  and  as  result  children  drowned  in  the  affected  areas.  Finally, 

despite the reporting mechanisms existing in the affected areas, the institutions providing the services are 

far away from the community and this makes it difficult for the survivors/victims to report their cases.    

   

4.8. Human Habitation and Shelter 
 
These communities need to be sensitized on the importance of having dual residence, one in the low lying 

areas with soils that are rich in mineral deposits and the other in higher and safer lands where they could 

take refuge in times of flooding. This should be done on voluntary basis and people should not be forced 

to migrate. The role of government would be to identify higher and safer lands where these communities 

can  build their second  homes. This should  be done with the  help of the  local and traditional  leadership. 

Upon  identification  and  acquiring  of  such  higher  land  for  the  flood  prone  communities,  and  where  the 

concerned communities agree to build their second homes, govenment would facilitate the establishment 

of  such  settlements  by  demarcating  the  land  into  plots  for  each  household,  and  also  provide  basic 

infrastructure  such  as  access  roads,  water,  health  and  education  in  the  new  settlements.  This  way 

resilience  would  have  been  created  for  such  communities  to  respond  to  hazards  such  as  floods  on  their 

own without or with minimum external intervention.   

 

The  state  of  the  majority  of  the  houses  occupied  by  the  displaced  households  suggest  that  these  are 

communities  who  depend  on  subsistence  farming  and  fishing  and  can  not  afford  to  build  conversional 

houses, hence, they  build the weak housing structures with pole  mud and grass. This suggests also that, 

they  have  very  low  capacity  to  respond  to  hazardous  situations  such  as  floods.  Government  and  other 

stakeholders should provide long term solution to the these communities who have settled in flood prone 

areas.  

 

 
 

 

62 

5. RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
5.1. Infrastructure 
 

•  There is need to mobilize funds to rehabilitate damaged infrastructure in 66 districts.  

 

• 

In the medium to long term there is need for government to invest in the construction of canal in 
the flood prone areas. The construction should be based on the Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA) conducted in these areas. 

  
5.2. Agriculture and Food Security 
 
Short-term  

•  Market intervention in Luangwa, Namwala, Lukulu and Sesheke (off-load commercial maize) 

to mitigate the food insecurity in these districts until the next harvest.   

•  Four  districts  namely  Mambwe,  Chavuma,  Gwembe,  and  Shang’ombo  be  placed  under 

monitoring 

•  Provide  market support to the populations  from surplus districts who  may  not manage to sell 

the surplus maize to FRA (e.g. WFP purchase for progress). 

 
5.3. Water and Sanitation 
 
It is worth noting that very little was done regarding the implementation of the recommendations for the 

2009/10  recommendations  and  work  plan  due  to  budgetary  constraints  and  therefore  most  of  the 

recommendations activities identified still remain as recommendations and action plan for 2010/11 

 

5.3.1. Water 

 
Short-term  

• 

Increase  availability  and  affordability  of  chlorine  at  household  level  in  all  the  fifteen  affected 

districts such as : Serenje, Mambwe, Kafue, Luangwa, Chavuma, Gwembe, Kazungula, Namwala, 

Sinazongwe, Kalabo, Lukulu, Mongu, Senanga, Sesheke and Shangombo, 

Intensify community sensitisation, participation and training in treatment and protection of water sources 

       through WASHE programmes. 

Rehabilitate, with community participation, damaged water sources and support affected communities in 

       improving their unsafe sources. 

63 

 

• 

• 

 

 
 

 

Medium to Long – term 

 

 

• 

Increase  access  to  safe  drinking  water  by  constructing  water  facilities  such  as  boreholes  and  dams 

especially in areas with poor or low access to safe drinking water  

•  Promote  rainwater  harvesting  facilities  and  spring  protection  and  utilisation  to  improve  access  to  safe 

drinking water. 

5.3.2. Sanitation 
 

 

Short-term 

•  Promote  and  increase  awareness  of  personal  hygiene  and  promote  behavioural  change  initiatives  at 

household and community levels. 

•  Upgrade to ‘sanplat’ standard the existing and commonly used traditional latrines 

•  Support communities to rehabilitate damaged latrines and other sanitation structures 

•  Advocate for hand washing with soap and make available soap 

 

Medium and Long  

•  Promote and encourage construction of strong and recommended structures  for excreta disposal  such  as 

“Sanplat” (improved traditional latrine) 

•  Strengthen and institutionalise WASHE programmes in all districts 

•  Formulate  and  enforce  policies  that  promote  construction  of  strong  and  recommended  structures  for 

sanitary or excreta disposal and hand washing with soap 

 

5.4. Health 
 

Short-term 

•  Provision of Insecticide Treated Mosquito Nets (ITNs) for prevention of vector – human 

contact. 

•  Provision of Rapid Diagnostic Testing Kits (RDTs) for easy and early detection of positive 

cases of Malaria.  

•  Provision of essential drugs (anti-malarial drugs) for the treatment of malaria cases. 

•  Strengthen community participation in good hygiene practices and waste disposal to prevent 

diarrheal diseases. 

64 

 
 

 

 

Medium to Long-term 

•  Strengthen malaria intervention, in accordance with National Health Strategic Plan (NHSP) 

2006/10. 

• 

Implement  Participatory  Hygiene  and  Sanitation  Transformation  (PHAST)  methodology  to 

improve community health. 

 
5.5. Nutrition 
 
Short-term 

•  Strengthen the identification and treatment of severely malnouriched children through 

expanded therapeutic and supplementary feeding programs provided by the Ministry of Health 

and NGO partners. 

•  Strengthen behavior change communication  related to infant and young child feeding and  

exclusive brestfeeding  for mothers (to be provided through health centres and by NGO 

partners). 

• 

 Intensify vitamin supplementation in areas with low coverage. 

•  Strengthen community involvement  in prevention activities such as; 

o  Peer to peer learning 

o  Breast feeding support groups 

o  Promotion of balanced diet and kitchen gardens. 

Long Term 

• 

• 

Improve access to health and nutrition services through the strengthening of the primary health 

care system and Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) outreach programs providing 

immunization, vitamin A supplementation and behavior change communication on infant and 

child feeding. 

Initiate/ expand programs to provide micronutrient  supplementation and surveillance for 

micronutrient deficiency in chronic food insecure areas. 

 
 
5.6. Education  
 
Short-term 

• 

 Rehabilitation of all damaged school infrastructure ( refer to details in the action plan) 

 

 
 

 

65 

Medium to long term  

•  Tents should be prepositioned to provide temporary learning facilities during the floods.  This 

will minimize disruptions in the learning process. 

• 

• 

 Provision of incentives for the teachers to be motivated to continue teaching during the flood 

period. This can be done through provision of relief food and non food items. 

 Pre-positioning of fairly big speed boats to ensure that children are rescued during the floods, 

to  avoid  loss  of  life  or  children  missing.  It  could  also  help  to  transport  children  to  schools 

across flooded rivers. 

 
5.7. Social Protection 
 

There is need for the Ministry of Community Development and Social Services (MCDSS) and its partners 
to:  
 

  Short-term 

•  empower families that are keeping orphans and vulnerable children; incapacitated and low 

capacity households and individuals; 

•  provide farming inputs to vulnerable but viable farmers in disaster prone areas; 

•  Sensitize the communities on the dangers of gender based violence,  

•  Provide  psycho-social  support  and  counseling  to  victims/survivors  of  gender  based 

violence.  

• 

 Initiate and promote family and community safety during disasters. 

 Medium to Long term 

•  Build  capacities  of  law  enforcement  agencies  such  as  the  police  service,  immigration 

department and community support groups to monitor gender based violence. 

•  To establish well coordinated response centres (CRCs) to enhance the provision of services 

to survivors/ victims of violence and abuse 

 

5.8. Human Habitation and Shelter 
 
Medium to long term 

•  Safer  lands to be  identified on the uplands and  be provided with  basic  infrastructure such  as 

boreholes, health and educational services for the resettling of the flood displaced persons. 

 
 

 

66 

•  Sensitize  population  residing  in  flood  prone  areas  on  the  importance  of  relocating  to  higher 

grounds. 

• 

Introduce  alternative  sustainable  livelihood  sources  for  the  resettled  populations  e.g  bee 

keeping
