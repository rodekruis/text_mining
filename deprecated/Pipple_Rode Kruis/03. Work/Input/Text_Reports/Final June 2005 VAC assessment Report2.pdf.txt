EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 
Zambia  and  the  entire  southern  sub-region  experienced  drought  during  the  2004/05 
agricultural season. Two thirds of Zambia, mainly the south western parts, was badly affected 
by  erratic  rainfall.  By  mid  February  and  March  2005,  most  of  these  areas  received  little 
and/or  no  rainfall  at  a  time  when  most  crops  were  at  critical  stage  of  development.  This 
rainfall situation caused irreversible agronomic damage to most crops. Drought tolerant crops 
such as cotton and tobacco were also affected by the erratic nature of the rainfall.  
 
It is against this background and the findings of the VAC Rapid Crop Assessment Report of 
March  2005  that  the  Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee  (VAC)  decided  to  conduct  the 
April/May 2005 assessment. The general objective of the assessment was to determine the 
impact of inadequate rainfall on household livelihoods in affected areas during the 2004/5 
agricultural  season. The  assessment  set out  to  address other sub  objectives related to the 
following:  food  security,  health,  nutrition,  education,  water  and  sanitation.  Further,  the 
assessment aimed to  estimate  the  number of affected  households  and  determine  the  food 
requirements  in  affected  areas.  Other  sub  objectives  were  related  to  understanding 
livelihoods, response strategies and recommendation of appropriate types of intervention 
 
The VAC assessment survey  covered 105 Standard Enumeration  Areas (SEAs) falling in 
17  Food Economy  Zones  or 1,690 households  residing in the  rural areas  of  the southern 
half of Zambia. The survey was carried out for a period of 21 days using a cross sectional 
sample.  Five  (5)  teams  consisting each  of 6 data  collectors implemented  the assessment.  
Three consultants consisting of one data analyst, one sampling consultant from CSO and a 
national statistical consultant were engaged to consolidate the research team. Within VAC 
membership, two coordinators spearheaded the two components of the assessment, one for 
the  household  questionnaire  while  the  other  for  Food  Economy  Approach  (FEA)  based 
module.  
 
Major findings 
 
  There was a marked downsizing in terms of input distribution and beneficiaries.  
  
  The  2004/05  cereal  production,  according  to  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and 
Cooperatives  (MACO)  has  been  estimated  at  1,121,071MT  of  which  866,187MT  is 
maize; 13,338MT is rice while the balance of 48,297MT is sorghum and  millet  After 
taking into account opening stocks, the Food Balance Sheet (FBS) shows that the total 
maize  available  falls  short  of  the  total  requirement  by  85,000MT.  The  rice  deficit  is 
estimated at 12,000MT while cassava surplus is at 324,834MT. 
 

  A  total  population  of  1,232,661  people  in  the  rural  areas  of  Zambia  (excluding  the 
commercial  farmers) are likely to be food insecure and would  require 118,335 metric 
tonnes of cereal  for a period of 8  months (July 2005 – February 2006) in 27 districts 
covering Lusaka, Central, Southern, Western and Eastern Provinces. 
 

  Seven districts, namely; Itezhi-itezhi, Nyimba, Katete, Chadiza, Chipata, Lundazi, and 

Chama will require monitoring of the food security situation through out the year. 
 

 

viii 

  The  survey  further  established  that  some  districts  that  were  equally  affected  by  the 
drought  were  not  as  severely  affected.  These  districts  were;  Mufumbwe,  Kasempa, 
Mpongwe, Lufwanyama, Masaiti and Chongwe. 

 
  The  major  determinant  of  wealth  in  most  zones  was  livestock  ownership  and  size  of 
land  cultivated.  In  the  zones  visited,  the  poor  wealth  category  formed  the  greatest 
proportion of about 50% while the  middle  formed about 30% and the better-off 20%. 
Generally,  the  major  contribution  of  food  came  from  own  production  and  this 
increased by  wealth group. This was supplemented by purchases in the better off and 
medium  wealth  bracket  while  labour  exchange  for  the  poor  household  was  the  key 
food 
recommended 
household/individual  caloric  requirements  for  the  year.  Labour  exchange  for  poorer 
households  was  the  highest  contributor  to  income  sources  while  crop  sales  were  the 
leading contributor for middle and better off households.

  The  main  chronic  hazards  in  the  areas  visited  were  two:  mainly  human-wild  animal 
conflict  and  crop/livestock  diseases.  The  periodic  hazards  common  across  all  zones 
were  erratic  rainfall,  floods,  poor  crop  marketing  and  input  distribution,  and  limited 
water sources especially for livestock. 
 

  As  for  under  five  nutritional  status,  the  assessment  has  established  that  there  were 
varying  levels  of  malnutrition.  Serious  cases  were  in  parts  of  Eastern,  North-western 
and Western provinces, and these will  require further investigations on causality. The 
assessment  also found  out  that  the  proportion  of  children  with  common illnesses  was 
high in areas where malnutrition was a concern. Equally, diet diversity among children 
was found to be inadequate across all the zones.  

 
  Under-five  mortality  was  within  acceptable  rates. In  the  areas visited  one  fifth of  the 
adult population were chronically ill, 12 months prior to the assessment. This situation 
has  a  potential  to  adversely  impact  on  food  and  income  sources  especially  that  a 
sizeable number of the chronically ill were head of households.  

 
 

In terms of education, it was found that the highest drop out percentage was higher for 
girls  and  this  was  common  in  valley  and  other  far  flung  areas.  The  main  reason  for 
drop out was early marriage, inability to afford fees and lack of interest. 
 

  Regarding  water,  the  assessment  established  that  the  distance  to  water  sources  was 
generally short and that about two thirds of the respondents indicated that there would 
be  no  reduction  in  quantity  of  water  compared  to  last  year.  However,  at  least  two 
thirds of households did not treat water. North-western province was most susceptible 
to unsafe water compared to other provinces. 

 
Recommendations 
 
  Preparations for food relief intervention should commence almost immediately to fit in 
the  recommended  time  frame of  July  2005  to  February  2006  in  the  affected districts. 
Programming  strategies  should  encompass  options  related  to  free  food  or  food  for 
work, choice of commodity and cash transfer options.

  For recurrent floods and droughts, permanent solutions to be sought through integrated 
water  management  schemes  such  as  simple  irrigation  techniques  for  agriculture  and 
small dams for livestock. 

 
  Strengthen  veterinary  programmes  in  Southern  province  and  extend  it  to  North-

western and Western Provinces 

 
Nutrition 
 
Enhancement  of  supplementary  feeding  programmes  using  HEPS  as  well  as  therapeutic 
feeding  programmes  following  international  standards  in  serious  and  risky  zones.  In 
addition there is need for improved management of child illnesses.  
 
Water 
 
There  is  need  to  enhance  the  current  interventions  in  water  treatment  such  as  use  of 
chlorine  and  boiling  of  water  before  drinking  since  two  thirds  of  the  respondents  in  the 
survey used unsafe water sources.  
 
Education 
 
Sustenance of girl child education programs especially in the valley areas. There is need to 
sensitize  guardians  on  equal  access  to  education  by  both  gender  and  discourage  early 
marriage for girls.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

 
1.1  Background 
 
Zambia  has  an  estimated  population  of  10.8  million  (CSO,  2000  Census)  of  which  60% 
live  in  rural  areas.  The  country  has  about  75%  of  arable  land.  The  majority  of  the  rural 
population  depends  on  subsistence  agriculture  as  their  source  of  livelihood.  The  most 
popular type of farming practiced by these farmers is mixed farming. Rearing of animals is 
most  common  in  the  southern  and  western  parts  of  the  country.  The  majority  of 
subsistence  farmers in  Zambia  grow  rain  fed  crops particularly  maize,  which is  the  main 
staple  food  crop.  Other  major  crops  include  millet,  sorghum,  cassava and rice.  However, 
the  country  has  been  experiencing  droughts  of  varying  severity  since  1991,  which  have 
affected  food  production.  The  most  affected  food  crop  has  been  maize,  which  is  nearly 
grown throughout the country. It is from this realisation that the Zambian government and 
its cooperating partners decided to put in place a Vulnerability Assessment Committee that 
is mandated to carryout periodic food assessments particularly in drought prone areas.  
 
The  VAC  is  a  consortium  of  government,  NGOs  and  UN  agencies  that  has  been 
conducting food security assessments since 2002. These assessments have been carried out 
in  collaboration  with  the  SADC  Food,  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources  (FANR) 
Vulnerability Assessment Committee. The purpose of these assessments has been to assess 
needs,  inform on  food  aid  distribution priorities  within the  country  and guide/inform on-
going food security monitoring. The current assessment is the third in the series of rolling 
assessments coordinated by the Regional Vulnerability Assessment Committee (RVAC). 
 
1.2  Justification and Objectives of the VAC Assessment 
 
The  country  has  just  experienced  another  drought  particularly  in  the  southern half  of the 
country. Most of the districts in this region experienced poor rainfall for the larger part of 
the  current  agricultural  season.  Consequently,  many  households  are  expected  to  become 
vulnerable  to  food  insecurity.  The  impact  of  the  drought  of  the  just  ended  agricultural 
production  season  on  the  rural  poor  is  not  known.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and 
Cooperatives (MACO) and the Central Statistical Office (CSO) have just completed a crop 
forecast  survey  (CFS)  aimed  at  determining  expected  production  and  expected  food 
deficit.  However,  the CFS  does  little  to  inform on the  effects  of the drought  on  people’s 
livelihoods or to understand these household’s capacities to cope. Thus, the CFS is useful 
but  only  as  an  input  into  a  comprehensive  vulnerability  assessment  exercise.  The 
government  and  other  stakeholders  (donors,  private  players,  etc)  require  information  on 
vulnerability  and  some  indications  of  spatial  differences  in  the  severity  of  the  effects  of 
drought  in  order  to  develop  informed  instruments  and  strategies  to  help  mitigate  them. 
Consequently,  there  is  need  to  collect  information  that  can  help  illuminate  the  expected 
food deficit that needs to be covered by food transfers. 
 
1.3  General Objective of the Assessment 
 
The main objective of this assessment is to determine the impact of inadequate rainfall on

1.3.1  Specific Assessment Objectives 
 
•  Assess the impact of inadequate rainfall on food security 
•  Assess the impact on under five nutritional status 
•  Assess impact of inadequate rainfall on education, water and sanitation 
•  Estimate the number of affected households 
•  Determine the food requirements in affected areas 
•  Assess coping strategies currently engaged in by households 
•  Recommend appropriate types of intervention 
 
1.4  Limitations 
 
One  of  the  largest  strengths  of  this  study  is  that  it  used  a  statistically  valid  multi-stage 
sampling scheme, which recognizes the heterogeneity of the livelihood zones as a basis for 
the first stage of sampling. However, the resources with which the survey was conducted 
were  limited.  This  limited  the  size  of  the  sample  greatly.  Had  more  resources  been 
adequate,  a larger  sample size  would  have  been  used so  as to  ensure  estimates  are  more 
representative at sub-district level to direct targeting.  
 
The late release of crop estimate data from the crop forecast survey was another identified 
limitation. These data should have been made available to the assessment team before the 
start of the needs assessment  exercise, which together with rainfall data  would have been 
useful in identifying areas to be covered in the assessment. 
 
Although normally weight for height is the commonly used measure of wasting, this study 
used  the  mid  upper  arm  circumference  (MUAC),  a  much  quick  and  logistically  more 
straight  forward  technique,  to  approximate  wasting.  Therefore,  malnutrition  prevalence 
rates estimated in this study cannot be compared with those from the recent results of the 
ZDHS, LCMS, and FHANIS, all of which used weight for height. 
 
1.5  Methods and procedures 

1.5.1  Sample Design and Coverage 

 
The  VAC  assessment  survey  was  designed  to  cover  105  Standard  Enumeration  Areas 
(SEAs)  falling  in  about  17  Food  Economy  Zones  or  approximately  1690  non-
institutionalised  private  households  residing  in  the  rural  areas  of  the  southern  half  of 
Zambia. The survey was carried out for a period of 21 days using a cross sectional sample. 
This  sample  is  nationally  efficient  and  is  expected  to  yield  reliable  estimates  at  Zonal 
levels since FEZ zones constitute explicit strata for the survey. 

1.5.1.1  Sample Stratification and Allocation  
 
The  sampling  frame  used  for  VAC  Assessment  survey  was  developed  from  the  2000 
Census  of  Population  and  Housing  and  the  Food  Economy  Zonal  maps.  Overlaying  the 
CSO SEA map onto the FEZ map developed the  assessment  frame. The Census frame is 
administratively  demarcated into  9 provinces, which are  further divided into  72  districts. 
The  districts  are  further  subdivided  into  155  constituencies,  which  are  also  divided  into 
wards.  Wards  nest  Census  Supervisory  areas,  which  in  turn  nest  Standard  Enumeration 

 

2

areas  (SEAs).  On  the  other  hand,  the  FE  Zone  map  is  made  of  28  zones.  However,  the 
current assessment only took place in 17 zones falling in the southern half of the country. 
According  to  the  meteorological  rainfall  indicators,  these  constitute  areas,  which  were 
characterized  with  poor  rainfall  during  this  agricultural  season.  For  the  purposes  of  this 
survey, SEAs constituted the ultimate Primary Sampling Units (PSUs).  
 
In order to have equal precision in the estimates in all the zones and at the same time take 
into  account  variation  in  the  sizes  of  the  Zones,  the  survey  adopted  the  Square  Root 
sample  allocation  method,  (Lesli  Kish,  1987).  This  approach  offers  a  better  compromise 
between  equal  and  proportional  allocation  methods  in  terms  of  reliability  of  both 
combined  and  separate  estimates.  Annex  1  shows  the  distributions  of  the  Primary 
Sampling Units (PSUs) or SEAs to Zones and target Districts.  

1.5.1.2  Sample Selection 
 
In  order  to  bring  logistics  and  costs  to  manageable  levels,  the  VAC  assessment  targeted 
districts in affected zones since a purely probability sample at zonal level would have been 
grossly  expensive  and  inefficient  in  as  far  as  the  objective  of  the  assessment  are 
concerned. The VAC survey employed a two-stage cluster sample design whereby during 
the  first  stage,  105  SEAs  were  selected  with  Probability  Proportional  to  Estimated  Size 
(PPES)  from  the  entire  target  districts  (Refer  to  Annex  1).  The  size  measure  was  taken 
from the frame developed in the 2000 census of population and housing. By implications, 
the selected districts and their corresponding SEAs represented the zones that nested them. 
 
The  second-stage  selection  of  households  for  the  VAC  Assessment  survey  adopted  the 
2000 census count of households in selected SEAs. Due to time constraints and inadequate 
funds, it was not possible to undertake an area listing exercise so as to obtain new counts 
of households. Therefore, the sampling interval was estimated by dividing the 2000 census 
count of  households in  every  selected SEA  by  15 since 15 households  was our desirable 
take  per  PSU.  The  inclusion  of  the  households  in  the  sample  was  systematically 
determined by the sampling interval.  
 
In  the  May  2005  survey,  the  household  instrument  queried  people  as  to  their  household 
demographic  and health  characteristics, asked them to quantify their own-production  and 
livestock  holdings  using  a  baseline  period  of  between  March  2003  and  April  2004, 
ascertained what they thought to be limiting factors of production, listed coping strategies 
employed  over  the  previous  year,  and  ranked incomes  and  expenditures over  the  past 12 
months.  The Key Informants survey compared current with April 2004 sales and purchase 
prices for staple foods, livestock, and cash crops, ascertained water sources and means of 
waste  disposal,  and  queried  as  to  newly  employed  coping  strategies  for  both  food  and 
income. 

1.5.2  Analytical approach 
 
The 2005 food needs assessment by the Vulnerability Assessment Committee (VAC) used 
two  different  but  complementary  approaches  –  the  household  economy  approach  (HEA) 
and  the  household  questionnaire  approach.  The  HEA  involved  using  livelihood-based 
analysis  for the purpose of understanding the impact, at household level, of hazards such 
as drought, floods and/or  market dislocation. The  first step in a livelihood-based analysis 
was  preparation,  in  late  June  2004,  of  a  livelihood  zone  map  comprising  28  zones  (see 

 

3

Annex 2).  This map delineates geographical areas within which people share basically the 
same  patterns  of  access  to  food  (i.e.  they  grow  the  same  crops,  keep  the  same  types  of 
livestock,  etc),  same  income  sources  and  have  the  same  access  to  markets.  Livelihood 
zone  boundaries  do  not  always  follow  administrative  boundaries.    Conversely,  one 
livelihood zone may cover several administrative zones.  In July 2004, four zones, namely, 
the  Gwembe  Valley  (in  Southern  Province),  Chongwe-Nyimba  Plateau  (in  Eastern 
Province),  Sioma  Plains  (Western  Province),  and  Zambezi  West  Bank  (North-Western 
Province) were assessed and baseline information on livelihoods documented.   
 
In the 2005 assessment, five teams went to 17 livelihood zones (see Annexes 1 and 2) for 
21 days in May 2005 to collect information on wealth groups, sources of food and income, 
patterns  of  expenditure,  bad  year  coping  strategies,  and  seasonal  calendars  for  each 
livelihood  zone.  Most  of  the  field  data  was  collected  from  district  and  community-level 
key informants and household-level focus groups.  The livelihood zones were selected on 
the basis of them falling in areas that were affected by prolonged dry spells and were high 
risk  areas  for  crop  failure,  Therefore,  areas  that  had  fair  to  above  normal  crop  growing 
conditions, mainly in northern  Zambia, were netted out. In areas like Gwembe Valley (in 
Southern  Province),  Chongwe-Nyimba  Plateau  (in  Eastern  Province),  and  Sioma  Plains 
(Western  Province),  which  already  have  baselines,  data  collection  was  limited  key 
informants  at  district  level.The  goal  was  to  obtain  community-level  findings  using 
purposively  sampled  communities.  The  results  of  the  community  discussions  were 
triangulated with key informant interviews. 
 
The  second  approach  used  in  the  VAC  2005  food  needs  assessment  used  questionnaire-
based household interviews. Here interviewed households were selected using a two-stage 
sampling scheme. The two approaches complemented each other in estimating the impact 
of the drought and in arriving at a red-spot map aimed at signalling to the government and 
other stakeholders in rural welfare. 
 
To derive the  extent of the damage on  food security  caused and/or expected to be caused 
by the 2004/05 drought, it was important to identify  a baseline against which to  compare 
the  indicators  of  impact  of  drought  as  observed  and/or  expected  to  be  observed  in  the 
months  following  the  harvest  of  this  season.  A  recent  year  that  is  generally  regarded  as 
having  been  normal  is  often  a  good  candidate  for  a  baseline.  In  this  study,  the  2003/04 
agricultural  season  and  the  coping  strategies  employed  in  the  agricultural  marketing 
season  that  followed  (2004/05  agricultural  marketing  season)  were  used  as  the  reference 
against  which  to  measure  the  expected  outcome  of  the  current  drought.  It  is  generally 
agreed that Zambia experienced normal agricultural years during at least two seasons prior 
to 2004/05.    
 
In addition to the usual demographics, the instrument used in the sample-based household 
survey  asked questions about  the  household’s  asset base  and the  agricultural situation in 
the just ended drought affected season, including actual and expected cereal production. In 
order to understand the (expected) movement in the direction of impact, much more effort 
was devoted to understanding the household’s circumstances (food and nutrition security) 
and  coping  strategies  employed  in  a  normal  drought-free  year.  Thus,  the  questionnaire 
asked  questions  on  nutrition,  cereal  and  tuber  production,  food  purchases,  food  sales, 
income sources, expenditure patterns, access to inputs and all other supplementary coping 
strategies  that  the  household  typically  employs  in  a  normal  year.  As  stated  above,  the 

 

4

survey considered and used the 2003/04 agricultural season and the (2004/05) agricultural 
marketing season that followed as a typical year. 

1.5.2.1  Estimating drop in cereal production 
 
Before performing any calculations involving aggregating across the different crops, each 
crop  was  converted  to  some  common  unit.  We  use  maize  calorie  equivalents  as  the 
common  unit.  To  obtain quantities  of  crops  in  maize  calorie  equivalents,  the  quantity  of 
the crop was multiplied by the ratio of its unit calorie content to maize unit calorie content:

The  calorie contents of various crop commodities were obtained  from FAO (1997). With 
2003/04  crop  production  regarded  as  normal,  the  drop  in  mean  cereal  production  was 
calculated  as  the  difference per  household  between cereal  production during the  2004/05 
agricultural  marketing  season  and  quantity  produced  and/  or  expected  to  be  produced  at 
the  beginning  of  the  2005/06  agricultural  marketing  season.  The  latter  was  computed  as 
the  sum  of  production  and  carry  over  stocks  as  of  May  2005,  when  the  survey  was 
conducted. 

1.5.2.2  Identifying desperate areas and persons affected 
  
All  districts  were  first  classified  using  a  process  that  determined  the  kilocalorie  gap 
resulting  from  the  current  years’  sources  of  food  and  the  desired  yearly  household 
requirement.  All  districts  that  met  the  yearly  kilocalorie  requirement  were  eliminated  at 
the first level. Districts that failed to reach the desired kilocalories were classified using a 
severity index. By this index, all those districts whose food sources only contributed one-
third of the kilocalorie  needs were  classified  as severe  while those  that  contributed  up  to 
two-thirds  where  classified  as  moderately  severe.  Those  districts  that  contributed  over 
two-thirds were classified as less severe.  
 
The severity index was estimated as the proportion of district energy requirement that is 
satisfied by production:

where 1,470 kcal is 70 percent of the daily energy requirement per person from cereal crop 
sources.  Following  nutritional  recommendation,  the  remaining  30  percent  of  the  kilo 
calorie requirement is assumed to be satisfied by non-cereal sources, Thus, the numerator 
is  total  energy  produced  whereas  the  denominator  is  total  energy  requirement  for  the 
district.  A  selection  method  was  developed  to  derive  three  classification  classes  of  food 
insecurity  severity  based  on  this  index.  A  district  is  regarded  as  severe  if  production 
satisfies  less  than  36  percent  of  the  calorie  requirement  and  as  moderately  severe  if  its 

 

5

cereal  production  satisfies  between  37  percent  and  59  percent  of  cereal  calorie 
requirement. Finally, a district is regarded as not being in severe cereal deficit if its cereal 
production satisfies at least 59 percent of the requirement. 
 
To determine the actual number of households affected, attention was given only to severe 
cases where it was established that their current response strategies are not enough to wipe 
out  the  food deficits  and  will  require  external intervention.  Other  categories could afford 
to  wipe  out  the  current  food  gaps  using  a  variety  of  response  strategies.  The  actual 
percentage  of  households  considered  very  poor  or  severe  was  determined  using  the 
household  economy  approach. This percentage was applied to the projected 2005 district 
population. 

1.5.2.3  Assessing under five nutritional status  

 

All children less than five years of age in the sampled households were assessed and tested 
for  malnutrition.  Past  experience  with  attempts  to  integrate  anthropometrical  data  in  the 
VAC  needs  assessment  showed  that  weight  and  height  measurements  are  very  time-
consuming. In this study, we estimated child malnutrition by measuring and examining the 
child’s  Mid  Upper  Arm  Circumference  (MUAC),  and  other  related  indicators.  More 
specifically, the nutrition/health module of the questionnaire captured data on: 
•  Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)  for children above 6 months but below  five 

years of age, 

•  Three-day dietary diversity recall, 
•  Sickness during the week prior to the survey 

 

The  MUAC  was  used  in  two  alternative  ways.  The  first  indicator  was  MUAC  itself  (in 
centimetres)  used to  identify  children  at  risk  of dying.  The second  indicator  was MUAC 
for  Age,  expressed  in  Z-Score. The  latter  was  computed using pre-developed  routines in 
Epi-Info. By the Z score, a child is considered to be globally  malnourished if MUAC  for 
Age is less than -2 Z-Score, and to be severely malnourished if MUAC for Age is less than 
-3  Z-Score  and/or  presents  oedema on  both  feet.  There is  no decision  chart available  for 
MUAC  for  Age  of  less  than  -2  Z-Score.  The  decision  chart  for  the  implementation  of 
selective feeding programmes uses Weight for Height of less than -2 Z-Score as a referral 
cut-off point (WHO, 2000).  
 
The analysis of results on prevalence of under-five malnutrition and recommendations on 
which livelihood zones requires development of selective nutrition programmes was done 
by comparison with total prevalence of the whole area of study (Southern half of Zambia) 
as a cut-off point Results on under-five prevalence of malnutrition should not be compared 
to prevalence of wasting identified through other national surveys. 
 
Results  on  child  dietary  diversity  were  interpreted  after  calculating  Individual  Dietary 
Diversity Score (IDDS)  for each  child1. To do this,  food items were grouped into 7-food 
categories  consisting  of  legumes  and  pulses,  milk  products,  sugar  products,  fruits  and 
vegetables, livestock products and carbohydrates. For each child, daily frequencies of food 
intake in the various food groups were calculated. The IDDS was calculated by summing 
across all food groups. A scale was then used to interpret the resultant values. The value is

of intake ≥0.5. Normative data on ideal levels of dietary diversity are not available thus an 
IDDS  of  3  was  chosen  as  a  cut  off  point  in  order  to  classify  children  as  having  a  poor 
(IDDS  <  3)  or  good  (IDDS  ≥3)  dietary  diversity  score.  Mothers  or  caretakers  were  also 
asked if the child had been sick during the week previous to the assessment.

2.  CONTEXT 

 
2.1  The Economy  
 
Despite  falling  short  of  targeted  growth  rate,  the  Zambian  economy  has  grown  at  a 
reasonably high rate in recent years. By the end of 2004, the economy had attained a 4.6% 
growth in gross domestic product. However, annual inflation rate has remained  relatively 
high  17.5  percent.2  In  agriculture,  the  government  intends  to  continue  focusing  on  food 
security,  crop  diversification  and  opening  up  new  agricultural  production  areas.  The 
fertilizer support program will continue at 50% subsidy level. 
 
The  continued  high  inflation  implies  low  effective  demand  for  agricultural  and  non-
agricultural  produce,  which  in  turn  has  had  an  adverse  effect  on  the  economy.  The 
projected inflation target of 15 percent may not be achieved as long as consumer demand 
remains weak.  The  exchange  rate  remained  relatively stable averaging  ZMK 4,700 per 1 
US$  during  2004  and  falling  to  around  ZMK  4,680  per  1  US$  mid  2005,  implying  a 
significant appreciation of the Kwacha. Commercial lending rates have slightly dropped to 
around 35% from an  average of  38%  in 2004. Interest  rates  have  remained  prohibitively 
high  and,  thus,  unfavourable  for  borrowing.  This  impediment  to  borrowing  has  kept 
private investment in agriculture very low. The low investment in agricultural  equipment 
and  early  warning/preparedness  systems  has  left  the  sector  highly  vulnerable  to  natural 
changes in weather.  
 
In  March  2005,  Zambia  reached  the  Highly  Indebted  Poor  Countries  Initiative  (HIPC) 
Completion Point  which  will  ensure  that  a substantial  part of its  debt  (amounting  to  ~$7 
billion)  will  be  written  off.  It  is  expected  that  savings  from  this  would  benefit  social 
sectors such as education and health. 
 
 
2.2 
 
Generally,  the  various  Input Distribution Programmes  have  had  a positive  impact  on the 
access  of  inputs  to  farmers  in  the  past  five  agricultural  seasons.  Unfortunately,  most 
districts remain substantially dependent on inputs distributed by the Government and Non 
Governmental  Organisations.  The  major  input  programmes  are  GRZ  Fertilizer  Support 
Programme (FSP), EDRP/DMMU Programme, PAM’s Food Security Pack (FSP) and the 
FAO input programme. All these programmes were necessitated by the desire to facilitate 
farmers’ recovery from previous droughts.

less.

In  the  2004/05  agricultural  season,  there  was  general  down  sizing  of  both  quantity  of 
inputs  and  the  number  of  beneficiaries  targeted.  The  total  maize  seed  and  fertilizer 
distributed dropped by 35% and 42% in 2004/05 season respectively while targeting 60% 
less  beneficiaries  compared  to  the  2003/04  season  (Table  2-1).  The  decline  in  input 
support  results  from  the  assumption  that  agriculture/food  security  interventions  would 
facilitate the transition to recovery and self-reliance for affected populations. 
 
Similarly,  the  Conservation  Farming  component  was  expected  to  provide  extended 
stability by improving soil fertility and consequently yields for the seasons of programme 
implementation and beyond. Realistically,  food  security  programmes have  not  succeeded 
in  ensuring  replenishment  of  farmers’  seed  stocks,  but  have  only  managed  to  meet 
immediate minimum food requirements in most cases. However, longer-term impacts still 
remain to be established.  
 
In  an  effort  to  increase  maize  output  following  significant  reduction  of  the  main  season 
harvest,  Government  through  Program  Against  Malnutrition  has  timely  (May  2005) 
distributed  inputs  for  wetland  production.  Western  and  Luapula Provinces  have  received 
the highest quantity of inputs while Southern and Copperbelt received the least. Although 
winter  production  contributes  significantly  towards  food  security  in  the  valley  areas  of 
Central Province these have been notably left out of the program. For instance, wet season 
production  in  Luano  Valley  is  much  more  than  the  rainy  season  harvest.  Although  past 
VAC  assessments  have  established  that  most  wet  season  production  is  done  without 
application  of  fertilizer  as  the  soils  used  are  relatively  fertile,  its  been  included  in  this 
programme.  The  sustainability  of  fertilizer  use  for  wet  land  maize  production  remains 
questionable.  
 
2.3  Food Supply and Access 

Among  cereals  produced  during  the  wet  season,  maize  continues  to  rank  number  one  in 
terms  of  output.  The  production  levels  of  other  cereals  (sorghum,  millet  and  rice)  have 
remained  relatively  stable  in  the  past  ten  years  (Figure  2-1).  When  maize  and  fertilizer 
subsidies reached their peak in the late 1980s, the area under maize cultivation was about 
1  million  hectares  accounting  for  about  70  percent  of  the  total  cropped  area.  During  the 
past  ten  years,  the  share  of  maize  to  both  cultivated  area  and  production  has  declined 
significantly.  The  drought  years  of  1991/92,  1994/95,  1997/98,  2000/01  and  2001/02 
resulted  in  corresponding  reduction  in  area  harvested.  This  implies  that  rainfall 
performance has remained the major determinant  of crop output in any given year. Other 

 

9

factors  include  high  cost  of  inputs  and  widespread  use  of  recycled  seeds  by  small  scale 
producers.  While  in  1989,  the  area  under  maize  cultivation  was  estimated  at  about  1.02 
million hectares; in 2004 it was only 631,079 hectares, a decline of 38 percent.

With  the  importance  of  maize  declining  both  in  area  and  productivity  and  that  of  other 
cereals  remaining  relatively  stable,  other  crops  have  been  increasing  their  share  in  the 
livelihoods of  Zambians.  Among these  are  two  major  cash  crops  cotton  and  groundnuts, 
and  root  crops  (cassava  and  sweet  potato).  Between  1989  and  1999,  the  cropped  area 
under groundnuts increased by more than 100 percent and the area for cotton increased by 
65 percent. The total area planted to cassava and sweet potato increased by 65 percent and 
54  percent,  respectively.  The  production  of  cassava  flour  has  more  than  doubled  in  the 
past  ten  years.  According  to  a  study  by  the  Food  Security  Research  Project,  cassava's 
percentage of  energy produced by smallholders has increased  from 16 percent in 1993 to 
31  percent  in  1999.  However,  cassava  production  in  2001/02  declined  by  12.4  percent 
compared  to  2000/01.  In  2004/05,  cassava  production  has  moderately  increased  by  15% 
with respect to the 2003/04 season. 

2.3.1  Crops and Food Supply in 2004/05 Marketing Season 
 
The  staple  cereal  production  for  the  2003/04  agricultural  season  in  Zambia  amounted  to 
1,273,578  MT  (excluding  wheat),  with  carry  over  cereal  stocks  from  the  previous  year 
amounting  to  101,156  MT.  This  was  with  the  backdrop  of  human  consumption 
requirement of  about 1,050,855 MT of  staple  cereals  for  2004/05 marketing season.  The 
total available  cereal  exceeded the  total  requirement  by 113,500 MT, implying  a surplus 

 

10

production  year. For  maize  alone,  there  was an  estimated surplus  of  120,000  MT,  which 
was available for export. 

The last two seasons saw the recovery of maize after two years of deficit production which 
led Zambia to move from a maize importing country to a major Southern African Regional 
maize  supplier.  The  WFP  has  in  the  past  two  marketing  seasons  purchased  substantial 
amounts  of  maize  from  Zambia  for  its  regional  and  local  programmes,  having  bought 
110,000MT  in  2003/04  season alone.  Informally,  Zambia  exported  at least  25,647MT  of 
maize  to  neighboring  countries  mainly  Zimbabwe  and  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo 
(DRC)  between  July  2004  and  April  2005.  At  least  60,000MT  of  maize  were  formally 
exported by the month of March. 

In  expectation  of  significant  reduction  in  the  2004/05  harvest  as  a  result  of  poor  rainfall 
performance, Government decided to take precautions by imposing a ban on maize export 
in  March.  This  was  done  in  the  absence  of  crop  estimate  figures,  therefore  has  likely 
resulted in market distortions. 

2.4  Livestock Situation  
 
Production of livestock is concentrated in three main provinces namely Central, Southern 
and  Western Provinces  with  cattle  contributing 62% share of  major  livestock in  Zambia. 
Other major livestock include goats (27%) and pigs (8%). Cattle population was estimated 
at 2,341,970 at the end of 2004 representing an 11% drop from the 2000 estimate.   
 
In  the  past  ten  years,  cattle  production  has  been  severely  disrupted  by  recurring  disease 
outbreaks, the common ones being Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) , East Coast Fever and 
Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP). The FMD is endemic in Sesheke (Western 
Province), Kazungula (Southern Province), Mbala and Nakonde (Northern Province), but 
in  2004  spread  to  parts  of  Central  and  other  Southern  Province  districts.  CBPP  endemic 
areas  are  Western  Province,  North-western,  Southern  and  extreme  Northern  Province 
Districts. East Coast Fever areas include Eastern, Central, Lusaka and Northern Provinces. 
Coincidentally, most of the areas affected by these diseases are also the ones that are prone 
to  drought.  This  often  exacerbates  farmers’  vulnerability  to  the  effects  of  drought  by 
taking away the  means to cultivate their land (draught power) as  well as one of the most 
relied on income source. Under normal circumstances, in these farming systems, livestock 
acts as some form of insurance against poor weather and the resultant crop failure. 
 
These diseases have affected the farmers in terms of loss of draft power as well as income 
source.  East  Coast  Fever  has  resulted  in  significant  loss  of  cattle  in  recent  years  and 
continues to be a major threat to cattle population. As long as farmers fail to employ good 
animal  husbandry  practices  (dipping), this problem  will  continue. The  recent outbreak  of 
FMD  in  Southern  and  Central  Provinces  led  to  the  government  imposing  a  ban  on 
livestock  movement  in  these  areas  in  September  2004  which  resulted  in  significant 
increase in meat prices in urban areas. With the expected reduction in crop output resulting 
from  poor  rainfall  performance  in  these  areas,  there  was  increasing  pressure  to  lift  the 
livestock  movement  ban,  the  threat  of  FMD  having  waned  after  vaccination  programs. 
Continued  movement  restriction  would  have  exacerbated  the  food  insecurity  situation  in 
affected areas. Consequently, conditional lifting of the ban was effected on March 4, 2005.

2.5  Water  
 
Zambia  has  a  high  surface  water  potential  with  many  perennial  rivers,  swamps,  dambos 
and lakes. The total surface water resource is estimated  at 2,747 cubic meters per second 
or  86,500  million  cubic  meters  per  annum.    In  total,  the  surface  water  resources  are 
estimated  to  cover  45,000 square  kilometres  (6%)  of  the  total  land  area3.  However,  its 
potential remains to be fully exploited for improved livelihood of its people and economic 
growth  of  the  country.  In  its  effort  to  improve  the  living  standards  of  its  people, 
Government’s main objective in the water sector is to promote sustainable water resource 
development in order to attain an equitable provision of adequate quantity  and quality of 
water for all competing groups of users at acceptable costs and ensuring security of supply 
under varying conditions. 

 

Compared to  most  countries in Southern  Africa, Zambia  enjoys  favourable ground water 
conditions  with  regard  to  depth,  storage  capacity,  available  yields  and  exploitation 
potential.  Total  ground  water  storage  is  estimated  at  1,740,380 million  cubic  meters  and  
ground water recharge at 57,500 million cubic metres. The major uses of water in Zambia 
are  twofold;  for  agricultural  purposes  and  non  consumptive  hydro  power  generation. 
Domestic and industrial uses are estimated to a mere 0.5 percent.

Rainfall has been known to affect water levels depending on the severity of the deficit or 
excessive rainfall situation. Generally, significant reductions in water levels were recorded 
in 1995 and 2002 which could be attributed to the severity of the drought of 1995 and the 
two consecutive droughts of 2000/01 and 2001/02. The trend of water levels for the month 
of  April  in  the  last  ten  years  for  some  monitored  stations  of  four  Districts  shows  more 
steep rises and falls in areas with high water levels than those with low levels (Figure 2-2). 
Figure  2.2  also  shows  the  differences  in  impact  on  water  levels  in  different  areas.  For 
instance  whereas  two  areas  (Mazabuka  and  Chongwe)  experienced  reduced  levels 
following  the  1997/98  drought,  the  impact  was  not  severe  enough  in  Senanga  and 
Mumbwa to reduce the levels. 
 
Recent  data  for  Senanga  indicates  that  the  levels  had  by  April  2005,  gone  below  those 
recorded  during  the  last  drought  year  of  2002.  During  the  2004/05  season,  rainfall  was 
most erratic in the low rainfall areas of Southern and Western Provinces.  
 
2.6  Nutrition 
 
Malnutrition is a major public health and welfare problem in Zambia. Under-nutrition is a 
result  of  both  inadequate  food  intake  and  illnesses.  The  inadequate  food  intake  is  a 
consequence  of  insufficient  food  available  at  household  level  and/or  improper  feeding 
practices.  In  most  cases,  improper  infant  and  young  child  feeding  practices  include  both 
the  quality  and  the  quantity  of  food  offered  to  children,  as  well  as  timing  for 
complementing  breastfeeding  (complementary  feeding).  These  underlying  causes  are 
further  influenced  by  factors such  as  income,  wealth of  households, distance to  markets, 
crops grown and livestock owned. Likewise, the dependency ratio also affects the capacity 
of households to meet their needs. 
 
Data available on nutritional status is primarily derived from anthropometric measurement 
on  children  under  five  years  of  age.  Three  indicators  are  often  used,  height-for-age 
6
 
(stunting)4 weight-for-age (underweight)5
and weight for height (wasting)
. Children under 
5 years old are  considered the most vulnerable, and therefore  children’s nutritional status 
is a good outcome indicator as it reflects both the household’s food and nutrition security 
and health situation.   

2.6.1  Trend analysis of malnutrition at national level 
 
Data for analysis of nutrition status has been derived from secondary data using:  
 

•  Zambia  Demographic  and  Health  Survey  (ZDHS),  CSO/CBoH/USAID/ORC, 

2001 

•  Living Conditions Monitoring Survey (LCMS), CSO, 2002 
•  Food security, Health and Nutrition Information System (FHANIS), CSO, 2003 

                                                 
4 Height for age, which shows linear growth, is measure of long term. The child whose height is below 2 
standard deviation of the Z-Score is stunted or chronically malnourished. Stunting is a result of long term 
deprivation due to repeated illness or inadequate dietary intake.  
5 Weight for age is a composed indicator for both linear growth and body proportion. A child whose weight 
for age is below 2 standard deviation of Z-score is considered as underweight. Child can be under weight 
because he is stunted or wasted.  
6 Weight for height is of current nutrition status. It is sensitive to recent past illness or acute dietary intake. 
Wasting is a form of acute malnutrition.

nutritional indicators between 2001 and 2003.

Stunting is indicative of a cumulative problem of the past. The findings are very similar in 
the  three  surveys  and  show  alarming  results  for  prevalence  of  chronic  malnutrition 
(stunting  varying  between  53%  -  ZDHS  2001-  and  47%  -  LCMS  2002);  prevalence  of 
stunting  in  Zambia  is  comparable  to  Ethiopia  (51.5%,  DHS  2000)  and  Malawi  (  49%, 
DHS  2000)  and  much  higher  than  West  African  countries  (38.7%,  DHS  Burkina  Faso 
2003 and  38.2%  DHS  Mali  2001).  About 28%  of  under-fives  were underweight  in  2001 
(ZDHS), 23% in 2002 (LCMS, 2002) and 24% in 2003 (FHANIS). 
 
National  prevalence  of  wasting  shows  a  stable  trend  or  insignificant  variations  over  a 
period of ten years. The prevalence of global acute malnutrition (wasting) ranged between 
2.5% and 7.6% and has remained stable over a period of ten years (CSO 1992; CSO 1996; 
CSO 2001/02). These  rates are within the global acceptable range (about 5%) and do not 
suggest  a  need  for  any  emergency  food.  But  they  indicate  need  for  preventive  activities 
including family’s nutrition education and community’s nutrition sensitization.  
 
In  Zambia,  children  between  zero  (0)  and  twenty  three  (23)  months  of  age  are  the  most 
vulnerable.  The  proportions  of  children  who  are  stunted,  underweight  and  wasting  is 
higher  during  this  time  (0  to  23  months).  Malnutrition  among  children  below  five  years 
was  also  found  to  be  associated  with  the  source  of  drinking  water.    The  ZDHS  2001  – 

 

14

2002 found that children  whose drinking water  was well water or surface water are more 
likely to be stunted than children with access to piped water.  

2.6.2  Trend analysis of malnutrition with provincial breakdown 
 
Health Monitoring Information System (HMIS) provides very useful quarterly database on 
child  growth  monitoring  underweight  rates  at  national  level,  even  if  the  coverage  of  the 
HMIS is low (coverage of 29.5% in 2003 and 31.5% in 2004).  At Provincial level, under-
weight  proportion  shows  a  decrease  between  2003  and  2004.  The  highest  under-weight 
proportions  were  observed  in  the  same  provinces  in  2003  and  2004:  Luapula,  Northern, 
Eastern and North-Western (Table 2-2). These provinces will require close monitoring and 
improvement in food security, health and nutrition programmes.

2.7  HIV and AIDS 
 
Zambia is facing an HIV/AIDS epidemic of considerable proportions (see Figure 2.4). The 
Zambian  Demographic  and Health  Survey  (ZDHS)  of 2001/02 found that  approximately 
15  percent  of  the  Zambian  population  aged  15-49  are  HIV  positive  (CSO,  CBoH  and 
ORC-Macro,  2002).  The  findings  from  this  population-based  survey  suggest  that  in  the 
younger age groups, women have higher infection rates than men. In the age group 25-29 
approximately 25 percent of women tested positive compared to 15 percent of men. In the 
older age groups men predominate among those infected. Prevalence data do not provide a 
grasp  of  the  annual  number  of  new  infections,  nor  does  it  provide  an  indication  of  how 
long  ago  people  were  infected.  Nevertheless,  the  data  indicate  that  large  numbers  of  the 
Zambian  population  will  fall  ill  and  die  within  the  next  couple  of  years  with  multiple 
health, social, economic as well as food security consequences.

Recent estimates by UNAIDS and the WHO put the number of people in Zambia that died 
of  AIDS-related  causes  at  120,000  in  the  year  2001.  These  organizations  estimate  that 
there are currently 570,000 children under 15 years in Zambia who have lost one parent or 
both parents to AIDS.  

 

 

HIV prevalence rates amongst 15-49 age group for  women and 15-59 age group for  men 
differ  markedly  by  province  with  the  highest  prevalence  in  Lusaka  (22  percent)  and  the 
Copperbelt  (19.9  percent)  Provinces.  The  Northern  (8.3  percent)  and  North-Western 
Provinces  (9.2  percent)  have  much  lower  infection  rates.  Differences  in  prevalence  rates 
by province are largely a function of the level of urbanization in each province. The 2001-
2002 ZDHS found that HIV infection differ markedly by place of residence. In urban areas 
the HIV prevalence was twice as high compared to rural areas at 23 percent and 11 percent 
respectively.  The  high  HIV/AIDS  prevalence  in  most  areas  undermines  the  households’ 
ability to mitigate against the effects of crop failure due to poor rains. 
 
2.8  Education 
 
The Zambian Government policy on education is supportive of ensuring that children have 
access to education as a fundamental right. However, this is far from being achieved. 
Between 1991 and 1999, the Zambian enrolment growth rate of 0.2 percent fell far behind 
the population growth rate of 3.3 percent7. In 2001, only 66 percent of the 2 million 
children of primary school age were in school and of those not in school, most (56 
percent) were girls. The primary completion rate in 1988 was also relatively low at 63

percent with the gender gap at 13 percent.  It was established that one major cause of low 
enrolment was the high cost of education. 
 
In  an  effort  to  increase  access  to  education  UN  Agencies  such  as  UNICEF  and  WFP  in 
partnership with Government have introduced some education programmes.  Among these 
was  the  introduction  of  community  schools  which  was  the  best  option  for  parents  who 
could  not  afford  fees  and  school  requisites  as  well  as  cater  for  increased  number  of 
orphans.  This  was  aimed  at  among  other  things  to  increase  access  to  quality  basic 
education  for  50  percent  of  school  aged  children  and  increasing  literacy  levels.  Other 
programmes supporting basic  education  has  been  school  feeding  programmes  in  selected 
schools.  This  aims  at  increasing  enrolment  and  attendance,  reducing  drop  outs  and 
improved  nutritional  status  of  school  going  children  through  provision  of  daily  ration  of 
fortified  blended  food.  WFP  is  currently  implementing  this  programme  in  parts  of 
Southern and Eastern Provinces with plans for expansion to other areas.  
 
Even  with the introduction  of  free  primary  school education by  Government in February 
2002,  fulfilment  of  the  right  to  quality  education  remains  a  major  challenge.  However, 
some improvements have been registered between 2001 and 2003 particularly through the 
implementation of  Programme  for advancement of  girl  education, re-entry policy  (young 
mothers able to continue school) and introduction of free primary education8.

3.1  Household characteristics and food security 

3.  FINDINGS 

3.1.1  Household characteristics 

 
The households in the survey population were of varied demographic characteristics. More 
than  three-quarters  (78  percent)  of  the  households  in  the  survey  population  were  male-
headed.  Like  many  other  studies  have  confirmed  in  the  past,  this  study  too  seems  to 
suggest that female headed households are relatively more disadvantaged than their male-
headed  counterparts.  While  the  majority  (93  percent)  of  male-headed  households  have 
married heads, most of the  female-headed households are either  widowed (51 percent) or 
divorced/separated (29 percent).  
 
Even though the aggregate number of female-headed households is less than a quarter of 
the number of male-headed households,  more than 79 percent of all widowed households 
are  female-headed.  With  an  average  dependence  ratio  of  about  1.9,  each  economically 
active  member  of  a  female-headed  household  takes  care  of  25  percent  more  dependents 
than does his/her counterpart in a male-headed households.  

3.1.2  Food security 

 
The  survey  covered  the  rural  households  in  the  southern  half  of  Zambia.  In  the  2004/05 
agricultural marketing season – a relatively normal year – although households displayed a 
wide  diversity  in  food  sources  and  other  livelihood  strategies,  it  is  clear  that  own 
production  remains  a  dominant  source  of  livelihood.  An  average  household  produces 
about 0.80  metric tons  of  maize  calorie  equivalents  of  cereals of  which  80  percent  (0.64 
metric  tons)  is  retained  for  home  use.  To  meet  their  cereal  needs  for  the  year,  the 
households  supplement the  retained  0.64 metric  tons with  an  additional  0.18 metric  tons 
obtained  through  other  means  (purchases,  casual  labour,  remittances,  etc.).  Thus,  more 
than  three-quarters  (78  percent)  of  the  cereals  utilized  by  the  household  are  from  own 
production (Figure 3-1).   
 
Given  that  the  bulk  of  the  remaining  20  percent  of  the  produced  cereals  is  sold9,  the 
contribution  of  own  production  to  livelihood  is  even  larger.  In  addition  to  contributing 
towards  cereal  purchases,  the  income  earned  through  cereal  sells  also  helps  to  partially 
meet other cash needs. Maize still plays a very critical role, accounting for almost all (98 
percent) of total cereal production. The dominance of own production in the household’s 
food basket confirms these households’ vulnerability to production-related food insecurity 
risk. This is further reinforced by the fact that the bulk, if not all, of these households rely 
on rain fed agriculture. The 2005 Zambia VAC survey was conducted at the beginning of 
the 2005/06 agricultural marketing season, which was probably too early for the impact of 
the drought of the preceding cropping season (2004/05) to show. However, one gets a feel 
of  the  expected  impact  by  looking  at  the  production  difference  between  the  year  in 
question  and  a  recent  good  year.  Table  3-1  presents  and  compares  cereal  production 
figures for the 2003/04 agricultural season, a good year, and 2004/05 agricultural season, a 
drought year.

Table  3-1  shows  that  in  the  southern  half  of  the  country  that  was  visited  by  the  VAC, 
cereal  production  dropped by  more  than  half  (56 percent) between  2003/04  and 2004/05 
agricultural seasons. The exact magnitude of the reduction varied by livelihood zone with 
the  largest  drop  in  production  experienced  in  Gwembe  Valley  (84  percent),  Kazungula-
Mwandi (82 percent),  Zambezi West  Bank (74 percent)  and Central  Cotton  (73 percent). 
Mufumbwe-Kasempa  and  Chongwe-Nyamba, 
the  least  affected 
livelihood  zones, 
experienced 30 percent and 39 percent drop in production, respectively. 
 
Reduction  in  and  poor  distribution  of  rainfall  during  the  2004/05  cropping  season  was 
cited  by  the  interviewed  households  as  one  of  the  leading  reasons  for  the  slump  in 
production.  This  argument  is  corroborated  by  rainfall  data  from  the  Meteorological 
Department. By the first dekad of March 2005, cumulative rainfall was way below normal 
in  most  parts  of  southern  Zambia.  As  expected,  districts  in  Southern  and  Western 
Provinces were the worst hit by drought. 

3.1.2.1  Rainfall and staple production   
 
The  2004/05  production  season  was  characterized  by  prolonged  dry  spells  resulting  in 
insufficient rainfall (drought) especially over the Southern and Western Provinces of Zambia. 
This has had severe  negative impact on crop  yield resulting in partial  and/or  complete  crop 
failure in the affected areas.  
 
Generally, the onset of rainfall in most parts of the country was good with the first rains being 
received as  early  as October 2004. Lusaka, Southern, some parts of Central (Mumbwa) and 
Western  provinces  (Shang’ombo)  were  the  exception  due  to  late  onset  of  rainfall.  By 
December  2004,  two  thirds  of  Zambia  mainly  the  southwestern  parts  were  already 
experiencing  erratic  rainfall  which  continued  through  to  January  2005.  By  February  and 
March  2005,  most  of  these  areas  received little  and/or no  rainfall  when  most  crops were  at 
critical  stage  of  development  and  moisture  was needed  most.  This  rainfall  situation  caused 
irreversible  damage  to  crops.  Drought  tolerant  crops  such  as  cotton  were  also  affected  by 
erratic rainfall.  
 
Figure 3-2 summarizes the relationship between cumulative rainfall’s departure from the 30 
year normal and staple production in selected locations in the Southern half of the country. It 
shows  that  erratic  rainfall  in  the  assessed  districts  had  significant  impact  on  the  overall 
production of the main food crop. Being one of the major determinants of a good harvest, 
the  extended  dry  spells  occurred  when  most  crops  were  at  the  critical  stage  of 
development (for maize, at grain filling stage). The graph provides a comparative analysis 
of  cumulative  rainfall  as  of  31st  March  2005  to  the  30-year  normal  rainfall  and  for  two 
seasons.  In  areas  which  received  good  rainfall,  2005  maize  production  is  comparable  to 
and  in  some  cases,  even  higher  than  that  of  2004  (Figure  3-2a).  In  the  case  of  cassava, 
reduced rainfall had insignificant impact on production which is not surprising as the crop 
is  relatively  drought  tolerant  (Figure  3-2b).  The  results  in  Figure  3-2  also  confirm,  as 
expected, that of the two crops, maize was affected most by the erratic rainfall situation.

3.1.2.2  What type of households had largest drop in cereal production? 
 
As already discussed above, cereal production has dropped drastically between 2003/04 (a 
relatively  good  agricultural  season)  and  the  2004/05  agricultural  season.  Because 
households are generally heterogeneous, it is important to have some insights on the types 
of households that were affected the most. Figure 3-3 presents both levels of (Figure 3-3a) 
and  changes  in  (Figure  3-3b)  cereal  production  across  selected  household  demographic 
characteristics.  
 
On  average,  households  with  married  heads  had  higher  levels  of  cereal  production  than 
any  other  category  of  marital status.  More  specifically,  cereal production  was  at least  75 
percent higher in households with married heads than in households with any other marital 
status.  When  disaggregated  by  gender  within  the  ‘married’  category,  male-headed 
households  had  25  percent  higher  levels  of  cereal  production  than  female-headed  ones. 
However, in most other ‘marital status’ categories households with female heads seem to 
maintain  relatively  higher  cereal  production  levels  than  do  male-headed  households.  For 
example,  there  is  not  much  difference  in  cereal  production  between  married  female-
headed households and single female-headed households.

However,  although they  have  high  cereal production  levels,  the  households  with  married 
heads are also the ones that experienced the most reduction in cereal production  
(Figure  3-3b).  This  means  that  not  only  do  households  with  married  heads  have  much 
more  food  than  their unmarried  counterparts  in  good  years but also that their  production 
systems  are  substantially  more  vulnerable  to  weather  changes.  On  average,  a  household 
with  a  married  head  lost  five  times  as  much  cereal  as  households  that  had  single  heads. 

 

 

22

Moreover, the drop in cereal production in households with married heads was 61 percent 
and  56  percent  higher  than  that  experienced  by  households  with  divorced/separated  and 
widowed  heads,  respectively.  Among  the  married  households,  those  headed  by  females 
experienced  37  percent  more  cereal  production  reduction  than  their  male-headed 
counterparts.  Similarly,  in  the  widowed  category  female  headed  households  are  almost 
twice  as  vulnerable  to  production  risk  as  male-headed  households.  Male-headed 
households are more vulnerable to production risk in the ‘single’ and ‘divorced/separated’ 
marital categories than their female-headed households. 

3.1.2.3  Food Supply and Outlook for 2005/06 Marketing Season 
 
The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  crop  estimates indicate that  maize production  has  decreased 
significantly from 1,207,202 MT in 2003/04 to 866,187 MT in 2004/05 production season, 
marking a  28 percent  reduction. This decrease is  mainly  attributed  to  the  poor rainfall in 
almost all parts of the  country  except  for the Northern, Luapula, northern parts of North-
western  and  Copperbelt  Provinces.  Contribution  by  the  commercial  farmers  to  the  total 
maize  production  is  expected  to  be  254,804  MT  (29  percent),  indicating  that  it  has 
remained  relatively  stable  (compared  with  253,861MT  in  2003/04).  However,  in 
percentage terms,  large-scale  contribution  has  increased  by 8  percent due  to  reduction in 
smallholder  production.  Although  all  provinces  recorded  significant  increase  in  area 
planted to  maize, production dropped due to  yield reduction. Only  Northern and  Luapula 
Provinces  increased production  by 28 percent  and  55 percent  respectively.  However, the 
levels  of  production  in  these  provinces  are  not  high  enough  to  cover  for  reduction  in 
output from the maize-belt. Similarly, sorghum recorded a slight decrease of 10 percent in 
production  despite  having  increased  hectarage  by  21  percent.  The  increase  in  hectarage 
could  partially  be  as  a  result  of  increased  access  to  seed  through  the  input  supply 
programs. Millet production declined by 25 percent despite a slight increase (7 percent) in 
area planted while rice production increased by 14 percent.  
 
Cassava production has marginally increased by 15 percent nation wide  compared to last 
production  season.  It  is  important  to  note  that  traditional  cassava  producing  areas  of 
Northern, Western and Luapula Provinces have maintained their high levels of production 
with  significant  increases  observed  in  Luapula  and  Western  Provinces  (over  25  percent 
increase). However, Copperbelt, Lusaka and Southern provinces which are non traditional 
cassava  consuming  areas  have  significantly  reduced  production  (25  percent,  54  percent 
and 71 percent drops respectively), attributable in part to reduction in area. 
 
The  2004/05  total  cereal  production  has  been  estimated  at  1,121,071MT  of  which 
866,187MT  is  maize;  13,338MT  is  rice  while  the  balance  of  48,297MT  is  sorghum  and 
millet (Annex 3). Wheat has not been included in the analysis for VAC purposes because 
it is a non-staple. After taking into account opening stocks, the Food Balance Sheet (FBS) 
shows that the total maize available falls short of the total requirement by 85,000MT. The 
rice  deficit  is  estimated  at  12,000MT  while  cassava  surplus  is  at  324,834MT.  It  is 
important  to  note  that  the  surplus  or  deficit  levels  are  influenced  by  competing 
requirements  such  as  human  consumption,  reserve  requirements,  stock  feed,  breweries, 
seed  and  cross  border  trade  (export).  The  balance  sheet  has  assumed  no  maize  strategic 
reserves  for  the  2005/06  marketing  season  and  no  informal  export  estimates  have  been 
factored  in.  Even  though  the  maize  export  ban  was  imposed  in  March,  exports  to  DRC 
have  continued at the same rate; a minimum of 1,890MT was exported in April alone. In 

 

23

addition, the 2004/05 FBS has underestimated breweries requirements, having reduced the 
amount by 50 percent with respect to last season10.   
 
Based on the above factors, the relatively low maize deficit (85,000MT) should be treated 
with caution. For the non traditional  cassava consuming areas, cassava is unlikely to feel 
up  the  gap.  The  Agricultural  Commodity  Exchange11observed  that  continued  strength  of 
the  maize  price  (US$180-190/MT),  reflects  the  weak  supply  situation. Currently  there  is 
uncertainty among the private sector on Government’s policy towards the maize shortfall. 
The continued 15 percent import duty on maize will discourage private sector imports. In 
the absence of imports, maize prices are likely to climb steeply towards the end of the year 
which will have implications on staple food access for poorer households.   

3.1.2.4  Staple food accessibility  
 
In the 2004/05 marketing season, maize retail prices remained relatively low much longer 
than  normal  in  line  with  the  good  supply  following  surplus  harvest  from  2003/04 
production  season.  The  prices  started  rising  only  at  the  end  of  2004  instead  of  the  usual 
period of August/September. In line with the normal maize price pattern, prices peaked in 
February/March and thereafter, fell as expected in April. With the reduced output from the 
2004/05  harvest,  prices  are  expected  to  start  rising  earlier  than  usual  (before  August), 
which  will  make  the  staple  more  difficult  to  access  for  poorer  households.  Compared  to 
the past three  seasons  (Figure  3-4), the  April 2005 prices in drought-affected  areas  were 
lower for most districts implying improved access to the staple food in 2005.

Mongu and  Choma Districts  however  were  exhibiting  higher prices  in  2005  with  respect 
to 2004. This could be attributed to the greater impact of the drought on the current harvest

in these districts compared to others. For Southern Province, most districts are exhibiting a 
similar pattern. The exceptionally high prices in Kasempa (2002, 2003) were partly due to 
high demand for exports to DRC. 
 
The  Agricultural  Commodity  Exchange  (ACE)  in  mid  May  observed  increases  in  maize 
prices  in  response  to  strengthened  demand  by  millers  and  brewers  in  a  bid  to  satisfy 
current  demand  and  build  up  depleting  stocks.  Contrary  to  expectations  of  increased 
supply  following  harvesting, current  supply has remained  relatively  low putting pressure 
on  prices.  This  could  partly  be  attributed  to  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  level  of  the 
2005  harvest  during  the  month  of  May  as  crop  estimate  figures  were  released  very  late 
(June).  
 
Overall  maize  prices  are  not  expected  to  reach  the  high  levels  which  prevailed  in  the 
2002/03  marketing  season,  A  number  of  factors  support  this  conclusion  including:  the 
higher  harvest  level  attained  in  2004/05  compared  to  2001/02  production  season  (42 
percent higher) and the relatively high carryover stock from the 2004/05 marketing season.  
 

3.1.3  Nutrition 

 
Several  nutrition  questions  were  asked  in  the  survey  with  special  focus  on  under-five 
children.  A  total  number  of  841  under-five  children  were  examined,  supplemented  with 
responses  from  the  mother  and/or  care  take  on  the  child’s  eating  attributes  and  food 
diversity.  Of  these  48  percent  were  females  and  52  percent  were  males.  Figure  3-5 
summarizes  information  collected on  prevalence,  nutrition and  health  characteristics (see 
Annex 4 and 5). 
 
Overall,  the  prevalence  of  child  malnutrition,  as  measured  by  MUAC  for  age,  was  15.5 
percent,  while  oedema  was  at  1.9  percent  (Figure  3-5).  The  survey  revealed  that 
malnutrition was more prevalent in male children (21.2 percent with Z-score < -2; and 2.2 
percent  with  oedema)  than  in  female  children  (9.5  percent  with  Z-score<-2;  and  1.6 
percent  with oedema).12 The total prevalence of  malnourished children,  which  was found 
to be 15.5 percent, was considered as a cut off point to identify the severe cases in each of 
the zones. 
 
Prevalence  of  global  malnutrition  among  under-fives  were  the  highest  in  the  following 
zones:  Mufumbwe-Kasempa  (Zone  3A),  Chama-Lundazi  Rice  (Zone  4B),  Eastern 
Province  Cash  Crop  (Zone  5B),  Mambwe-Petauke Valley  (Zone 12B), and  Sioma Plains 
(Zone 6). It was also observed that prevalence of severe acute malnutrition was the highest 
in  Zones  Chama-Lundazi  Rice  (Zone  4B)  and  Mambwe-Petauke  Valley  (Zone  12B). 
Prevalence  of  malnutrition  was  moderate  (equal  to the total prevalence)  in  Zambezi  East 
(zone 10B) and Luano Valley (zone 7C), while Mulobezi Woodlands (zone 9), Line of rail 
commercial zone (5A), Mkushi commercial block (zone 13), Gwembe Valley (zone 11A) 
and Central Maize-Cotton zone (4A) had acceptable malnutrition levels (see Annex 6).

Mention must be made here that although Chongwe-Nyimba plateau (7B) showed a low 
prevalence of malnutrition, the zone showed a high proportion of children with high risk 
of mortality (MUAC less than 11 cm). Other zones with high proportions of under-fives 
with risk of mortality were Mambwe-Petauke Valley (12B) with 6.9% and Sioma plain 
(6).  

Cases of bilateral oedema have been also identified in some zones. The highest prevalence 
were in Zambezi East – zone 10B (2.6%), Gwembe valley zone -11A (2.3%) line of rail 
commercial zone 5A -3.3% and  Kazungula-Mwandi plain zone 7A–(3.8%).  

The under- five diet diversity varied across all the zones visited (see Figure 3-6, above). It 
was established that dietary diversity was generally not adequate. Fifty one percent (51%) 
of the children had inappropriate diet diversity score.  
 

3.1.3.1  Household characteristics affecting child malnutrition 
 
There was a higher proportion of children among male-headed households with moderate 
and  severe  malnutrition  than  among  female-headed  households  (Table  3-2).  The 
household  size  had  critical  role  to  play  in  the  prevalence  of  malnutrition  among  the 
children  included  in  the  sample.  It  was  also  observed  that  the  larger  the  family  size  the 
higher chances of having children with low Mid-Upper Arm Circumference.

3.1.3.2  Dietary Diversity and child feeding practices 
 
Majority of households in the areas visited reported to have had two meals in a day. It was 
revealed  that  high  proportion  of  children  who  had  acute  malnutrition  were  from 
households  having  one  meal  a  day.  Dietary  diversity  was  used  as  measurement  of  child 
food  intake  for  children  above  6  months.  The  study  revealed  that  a  higher  proportion  of 
male children (51.9%) had an inappropriate diet diversity score than their female counter-
part (45.0%). Overall, about 48.6 percent of all the under-five children had inappropriate 
diet diversity. 
 
Dietary  Diversification  Score  was  compared  to  MUAC  for  age  of  children  below  five 
years.  It  was  also  observed  that  inappropriate  diet  diversity  score  was  more  prevalent 
among  male  children  in  the  sample.  It  was  observed  that  about  54.2%  of  malnourished 
children  had  inappropriate  diet  diversity  while  46.8%  of  children  with  no  problem  of 
malnutrition  had  also  inappropriate diet diversity.  Diet diversity  is  inadequate  for a  large 
percentage  of  children  but  the  difference  between  malnourished  and  non  malnourished 
children is less important as expected.

3.1.3.3  Morbidity and childhood malnutrition 
 
The study revealed that as high as 43 percent, 62.6 percent and 48.8 percent of the children 
have  had  diarrhoea,  fever  and  cough,  respectively,  within  a  week  prior  to  the  survey.  A 
high proportion  of  children  with acute  malnutrition  were  reported to have had  diarrhoea, 
fever and a cough a week prior to the survey (Table 3-3).

3.1.3.4  Water and sanitation and child malnutrition 
 
The main sources of drinking water in the communities visited were unprotected shallow 
wells, unprotected spring, unprotected deep wells, protected deep wells, and village 
boreholes. The survey found that children with unprotected water source had a higher risk 
of being acute malnourished. Water treatment had no significant impact on the proportion 
of children having malnutrition. 

3.1.4  Health 

3.1.4.1  Childhood illness 
 
In terms of health status, diarrhoea,  fever and  cough were the most prevalent illnesses as 
sited  by  caregivers  of  the  children  in  the  zones  visited.  The  study  recognized  that  these 
illnesses were more common male children than their female counterparts. The proportion 
of under-fives child diseases differed among the zones. Most of the clinical signs illnesses 
(diarrhea, fever, cough and difficulties in breathing) were prevalent in the following zones: 
Chama-Lundazi (zone 4B), Luapula Valley (zone 5B) and Mambwe-Petauke (zone 12B).

3.1.4.2  Crude mortality rates 
 
The  overall  crude  mortality  rate  (CMR)  for  the  six  months  prior  to  the  survey  was  just 
about normal at 0.7 deaths per 10,000 per day.13 However, some zones had unacceptably 
high  CMRs.  For  example,  Mkushi  Commercial  Block  (Zone  13),  Kazungula-Mwandi 
Plain  (Zone  7A),  and  Mulobezi  Woodlands  (zone  9)  had CMRs  as  high  as  1.3, 1.2,  and 
1.2, respectively (Figure 3-7).

Crude mortality rate (deaths per 10,000 people per day)

 

Among  the  household  members  who  died  during  the  6  months  prior  to  the  survey,  17 
percent had been  chronically ill  for more than 3 months. When disaggregated by age, the 
under-five  mortality  rate is  reasonably low  with  a  crude  mortality  rate  of 0.2  per 10,000 
per  day.  The  highest  mortality  rates  were  observed  among  15-49  year  and  >50  year  age 
groups, each at 0.4 persons per 10,000 per day. 

3.1.4.3  Chronic illness among adults in the past 12 months 
 
About 20.7 percent of the adults in the study area have been chronically ill for more than 3 
months  during  the  12  months  prior  to  the  study.  Amongst  them,  6.4%  were  heads  of 
households.  When  disaggregated  by  livelihood  zone,  Gwembe  Valley  (Zone  11A), 
Mulobezi  Woodlands  (Zone  9)  had  the  highest  proportion  of  chronically  ill  adults  at  9 
percent, followed by Mambwe-Petauke Valley (Zone 12A) at 7 percent.

3.1.4.4  Access and use of health services 
 
Among members of households who got sick during the two weeks prior to the survey, 7.7 
percent  did  not  seek  health  care.  About  57.2  percent  sought  care  from  formal  health 
facilities,  5.1  percent  got  home-based  cared  (own  medication),  3.2  percent  from  a 
pharmacy  or dispensary,  2.7 percent  from private  care  and  2.6 percent  from  a traditional 
healer. 
 
When  the  formal  health  facilities  were  not  used,  the  reason  mentioned  were  lack  of 
transport  (6.2%),  lack  of  money  (4.9%),  poor  care  quality  -lack  of  confidence  in  health 
staff, poor availability of drugs (0.3%), religious or cultural reason (0.8%) and “patient too 
ill to be moved” (0.1%) 

3.1.5  Water 

3.1.5.1  Drinking Water 
 
The main sources of drinking water in areas assessed were river, lake, well and borehole. 
Access  to  safe  water  was  highest  in  Eastern  Province  Cash  Crop  Zone  (93%),  Central 
Cotton Maize  Zone  (81%),  Mkushi Commercial  Block  Zone  (77%)  and  Gwembe  Valley 
(69%).  Poor  access  to  safe  water  on  the  other  hand  was  highest  in  Zambezi  East  Zone 
(92%),  Mufumbwe  Kasempa  Zone  (65%),  Chama-Lundazi  Zone  (61%)  and  Mambwe 
Petauke (59%). Generally, the problem of access to safe water is more prevalent in North-
western Province and valley areas of Eastern Province (see Figure 3-8). It is worrying that 
about  two  thirds  of  households  in  all  assessed  areas  do  not  treat  water  despite  the  high 
levels  of  access  to  unsafe  water  in  some  areas  which  could  result  in  high  risk  of  water 
borne diseases. 
 
On average, distance to water source in all assessed areas was a kilometer or less implying 
that  currently  most  households  have  drinking  water  source  within  reasonable  distance 
regardless of the safety (Table 3-5).   
 
Compared  to  April  2004,  water  quantity  had  remained  more  or  less  the  same  for  most 
areas.  Chongwe  Nyimba  and  Chama  Lundazi  however  recorded  a  77%  and  50%  of 
households having less water  respectively. Note that Chama  Lundazi also has the highest 
percentage  of  shallow  wells  supporting  the  reduced  quantity  situation.  It  is  however 
possible  that  the  situation  in  some  of  the  other  areas  could  deteriorate  later  on  in  the 
season when the full impact of the drought may be felt. Generally, most water sources for 
drinking  water  (80%)  do not  dry  up. Among  the  areas  covered, only Chongwe –Nyimba 
was a special case  with at least 51% having experienced drying up of water source while 
for other areas, the percentage was much lower. 
 
Among  the  covered  areas,  Chongwe  Nyimba  and  Chama  Lundazi  had  by  May  already 
started  experiencing  reduced  water quantity  compared  to  other areas. Currently  these are 
the main areas of concern in terms of water supply.

3.1.5.2  Water for Livestock  
 
Water supply for livestock in many areas is a source of concern and the situation is likely 
to worsen later on in the year when full impact of the drought on water sources is likely to 
be  felt.  In  the  major  cattle  keeping  areas  of  Southern,  Western  and  Central  Provinces 
farmers will  start  driving  their herds  far distances in search  of  water as  the  main  sources 
(streams) completely dry up. This is likely to increase risk of disease outbreak as animals 
mix during grazing and sharing of limited water sources. In Mumbwa District for example, 
animals will be going to the Kafue plains for water and pasture mixing with wild animals 
in game reserves. This was the  cause of the last Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak  which 
spread to non endemic areas of Central and Southern Provinces.  

3.1.6  Education 

 
The  findings show that the number of households with at least one  child dropping out of 
school in the twelve months prior to the assessment ranged from 13% in Luano Valley to 3 
percent  in  Kazungula-Mwandi  Zone.  Generally,  there  were  more  drop  outs  recorded  in 
valley areas compared to other areas which could be attributed to more access problems as 
a result of poor infrastructure in such areas. 
 
The  drop  outs  were  found  to  be  much  higher  for  girls  than  for  boys  which  is  of  much 
concern.  The  drop  outs  were  mainly  attributed  to  economic  reasons  despite  Government 
having declared primary education free. The other reason was the lack of interest in school 
by children from these households.  
 
3.2 

        Rural livelihood situation 

3.2.1  Baseline profiles of zones visited 

 
The  major  economic  activity  for  most  households  in  the  zones  visited  was  agriculture. 
Most households practiced mixed farming covering mainly crop and livestock production. 
The  main  crops  grown  for  consumption  were  maize,  sorghum,  millet,  rice,  groundnuts, 
and beans. The main cash crops grown in most zones were cotton, tobacco, rice, soybeans 
and  maize.  Tobacco  and  cotton  are  mostly  grown  under  contract  farming  where  a 
company  provides  all  the  necessary  inputs  and  extension.  The  contracting  company 
afterwards  recovers  related  costs  at  the  time  of  buying  from  the  farmers.  Soybeans,  rice 
and  maize  do  not  have  clearly  defined  marketing  channels  and  there  marketing  mostly 
depend on farmers’ own arrangement. 
 
Apart from crop production some zones are rich in livestock and livestock products. Cattle 
are  the  dominant  form  of  livestock  reared  followed  by  goats,  pigs  and  chickens.  Most 
cattle  are  reared  for  draught  power  and  some  for  home  consumption.  Livestock  plays  a 
very big role in the livelihood of the people as key sources of food and income. 
 
Most  zones  have  basic  structures  that  support  localized  trading  and  marketing  of 
agricultural  products.  Overall, road  networks are  poor and  this  has  proved to be  a  major 
constraint  and  has  resulted  in  most  economic  potential  not  being  fully  exploited.  Fewer 
households  are  engaged  in  formal  employment,  but  there  is  a  lot  of  opportunity  in  most 
zones  for  agricultural  casual  labour  mainly  from  better-off  farmers.  The  major  threats to 

 

32

the  livelihoods  in  most  zones  are  drought,  excessive  rains,  localized  flooding,  livestock 
diseases, crop pests and poor marketing systems. 

3.2.2  Market performance 

 
The  major  food  commodities  traded  in  most  zones  are,  maize  and  other  smaller  cereals. 
Prices of crops vary with the time of the year. Before the main harvest in April which also 
coincides  with  the  hunger  period  in  most  zones,  prices  tend  to  be  high  but  later  decline 
following harvesting and then steadily until December.  
 
Retail prices of maize remained relatively low compared to other foods. Compared to the 
same period  in  2003  and  2004, prices  in  April 2005 have  remained  at  a lower level (see 
Figure  3-9).  However,  for  livestock,  the  prices  have  been  generally  higher  than  the  past 
two years. This trend was expected due to the recent past good years when grain supply on 
the  market  increased  significantly leading  to  lower  prices.  Prices  of  cash  crops  generally 
remained  lower  than  the  past  two  years.  It  was  evident  that  despite  the  fact  that  some 
markets  are  well  defined  and  strategically  located,  the  local  farmers  especially  the  small 
scale  farmers  continue  to  get  low  prices  for  their  produce.  With  free  market  system  the 
local farmers are struggling to learn how to get the best value for their products.

In a typical  year livestock trading is low because  livestock owners are not willing to sale 
their  livestock.  Livestock  sales  reach  maximum  at  the  beginning  of  the  school  year  as 
livestock  owners  start  raising  money  to  send  children  to  school.  The  period  between 
September  and  December  are  typical  hunger  months  and  during  this  period  there  are 
desperate sales of livestock at low prices. The increased food supply in the past two years 
has  assisted  in  stabilizing  and  raising  livestock  prices,  as  there  has  been  less  desperate 

 

 

33

selling.  Small  livestock  especially  chickens;  goat  and pigs  are  easily  traded  compared to 
cattle.  

3.2.3  Wealth Ranking 

 
Wealth status has enormous implications on access to food and income (see Figure 3.10). 
Better  off  households  cultivate  larger  areas  of  land  and  in  addition  employ  casual  labor.  
As  a  result,  they  produce  more  food  and  cash  crops.    Better  off  farmers  usually  own 
livestock that act as a direct source of income through sales.  Poor households, in contrast, 
usually access plough oxen through labor exchange implying that they cultivate only small 
areas  and  plant  late.    The  poorer  households  rarely  have  livestock  to  sell,  with  the 
exception of chickens.  
 
The  major  determinant  of  wealth  in  most  zones  is  livestock  ownership  and  size  of  land 
cultivated.  The  better  off  households  have  larger  holdings  of  land  owned  and  under 
cultivation. They have livestock and can afford to purchase agricultural inputs. They also 
hire  casual  labor  from  the  worse  off  households.  The  poor  wealth  category  usually  does 
not  own  livestock  and  have  smaller  land  parcels.    The  different  wealth  characteristics 
make  a  big  difference  in  livelihood  patterns  and  coping  mechanisms  among  different 
wealth groups. Both of these have implications and determinant effect on type and amount 
of crop cultivated, income and expenditure patterns and levels of food security.

In the zones visited, the poor wealth category formed the greatest proportion of about 55% 
while  the  middle  form  about  30%  and  the  better-off  20%.  The  highest  proportion  of  the 
poor  was  in  Central  maize  cotton  zone  (56%).  This  was  followed  by  Chongwe-Nyimba 
plateau,  Luano  valley  and  Zambezi  East  zones  at  (55%).  The  lower  categories  of  poor 

 

 

34

households  were  in  Mambwe-Petauke,  Eastern  province  cash  crop  and  Chama-Lundazi 
rice zones  at  15%, 23%  and  30% respectively.  Apparently  these  are  the same zones that 
had  the  higher  proportions  of  the  middle  categories.  Generally  the  zones  with  high 
potential for production and income opportunities, like the Eastern province cash crop, had 
higher  categories of  middle  households  while  those  in  the  flood plains,  like  the  Zambezi 
flood plains, had higher proportions of poor households.  
 

3.2.4  Seasonal Calendar 

 
Most  seasonal  activities  in  the  zones  visited  are  heavily  dependant  on  agricultural 
production  for both food and income. The  common activities across the zones are shown 
in Figure 3-11.

The  common  agricultural  activities  in  all  the  zones  start  with  the  onset  of  rainy  season. 
From  October to November  land  preparation  is completed  for  most crops, which  include 
maize,  sorghum,  cowpeas  and  groundnuts.  Planting  follows  land  preparation  with  the 
onset of rainfall in November and December. Weeding is done from February to March. In 
wetland areas, like Luano valley, land preparation and planting is done in winter, between 
end of July and September. May and June are periods of dry harvest for most crops while 
March marks the beginning of green maize consumption until the beginning of April.  
 
Milk production peaks form January to April, when there is plenty of grass and water for 
the  cattle.  Livestock  sales  peak  in  January  due  to  school  fees  and  from  October  to 
December  due  to  lack  of  staple  grain,  maize.  Casual  labour  employment  for  land 
preparation  increases  with  the  beginning  of  rainy  season  in  October  to  November. 
February  to  March  is  weeding  time  and  May  to  June  is  the  harvesting  period.  Off  farm 
employment is highest from July to September. Collections of  wild  food tend to increase 
from  February  to  April.  Fishing  starts  from  the  end  of  fish  ban  in  March  and  increases 
steadily  from  April  to  July.  Casual  labour  employment  increases  with  the  beginning  of 
rainy  season  from  October  to  November  since  this  is  the  period  for  land  clearing  and

preparation.  February  to  March  is  time  for  weeding  and  May  to  June  is  the  harvesting 
period. Off farm employment is highest from June to September 
 
The  hunger  months  are  from  September  to  February  in  a  typical  year.  However  in  the 
wetlands hunger months are reduced by consumption of green maize. 
 
Most  food  and,  to  a  limited  extent,  income  acquisition  strategies  in  most  zones  revolve 
around the rainy season. In zones with potential for cash crops, there is a sequence of cash 
injections  at  peak  harvest  and  sale  time  through  out  the  season.  This  cycle  assists  to 
mitigate deterioration in food security.   

3.2.5  Household sources of food 

 
Figures 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14 show the sources of food for the different wealth groups. The 
graphs  represent  the  contribution  of  each  food  type  to  the  2100Kilocalories  (Kcal)  per 
person per day  requirement in a typical  year like 2004. Generally, the  major  contribution 
of  food  came  from  own  production  and  this  increased  by  wealth  group.  This  was 
supplemented  by  purchases  in  the  better  off  and  medium  wealth  bracket  while  labour 
exchange for the poor household was the food key supplement.  

3.2.5.1  Sources of food for poor households 
 
As depicted in Figure 3-12, even in a good year, most poor households failed to reach the 
recommended  household/individual  caloric  requirements  for  the  year.  Poor  households 
tried to make up their food shortfall through labour exchange to the middle and the better 
off. Some poor households used  wild  food as a major food source.  Across the livelihood 
zones,  the  poor  wealth  groups  in  Mambwe-Petauke,  Mufumbwe-Kasempa,  Line  of  rail 
commercial  and  Luano  valley  were  more  food  insecure,  as  their  combinations  of  food 
sources did not contribute much to kilocalorie requirement.  
 
For  poorer  households  vegetables  and  wild  fruits  usually  filled  the  food  gap.  The  poor 
categories  in  the  Central  maize-cotton,  Chongwe-Nyimba  and  Kazungula-Mwandi  have 
food  sources  that  contribute  just  about  100%  of  their  kilocalorie  needs.  Meanwhile  the 
poor  in  the  remaining  zones  have  food  sources  that  contribute  over  100%  of  kilocalorie 
needs.  

3.2.5.2  Sources of food for middle households 
 
The  contribution  of  food  to  kilocalorie  requirement  for  middle  households  is  shown  in 
Figure 3-13. In all the zones visited the  current food sources are  able to meet kilocalorie 
needs for the middle wealth group.  
 
The  biggest  share  of  food  contribution  for  the  middle  category  was  generally  own  crop 
production  followed  by  purchases,  labour  exchange  and  livestock.  There  were  very  few 
cases  of  relief  or  gifts  as  major  food  sources.  High  crop  production  areas  like  Chama-
Lundazi zone, managed to attain carryover stocks.

3.2.5.3  Sources of food for better-off households  
 
Figure  3-14  shows  the  combination  of  food  sources  for  the  better-off  households.  The 
better-off  wealth  group  were  able  to  meet  their  kilocalorie  requirement.  The  line  of  rail 
commercial,  Zambezi  east,  Mufumbwe-Kasempa  and  Mambwe-Petauke  zones  were 
almost  on  the  threshold.  Purchases  still  made  a  significant  contribution  to  kilocalorie 
needs  as  did  own  livestock.  This  wealth  group  did  not  engage  much  in  labour  exchange 
nor  depended  on  relief  or  wild  foods.  The  high  crop  producing  zones  exhibited  high 
quantities of contribution from own crops compared to those zones in valley areas.

3.2.5.4  Analysis of food sources  
 
The  contribution  of  own  crop  production  increased  with  wealth.    Poorer  households 
obtained  about  50%  of  their  food  needs  from  their  own  production  and  according  to  the 
seasonal calendar accounted for roughly 5 months of consumption. Meanwhile the middle 
and  better  off  households  obtained  almost  all  of  their  food  from  their  own  crops.    The 
major  source  of  difference  between  the  poor  and  the  middle  was  that  the  poor  ended  up 
with insufficient time spent in their own fields as a result of selling their agricultural labor.  
 
The  contribution  of  purchases  or  exchange  declined  with  wealth.  Own  crop  production 
became less significant as a source of food among the middle and better off wealth groups 
as purchases became more prominent.  The reason for this trend was that some maize was 
grown  as  a  cash  crop  and  as  one  moves  up  the  wealth  groups,  maize  became  the  more 
dominant  crop  grown  and  mainly  for  sale.  Cassava  was  generally  preferred  for 
consumption  in  areas  like  Zambezi  west  where  it  is  a  staple.    In  such  areas,  better  off 
groups grew maize for sale and then purchased cassava from those selling.  

 

38

Poor and lower middle households were forced to make up the shortfall in their food crop 
needs through working directly for food (labour exchange) or through working for cash to 
purchase  food  (and  other  essential  non-food  items).    Poor  households  obtained  a 
significant  part (30-40%)  of  their  food in this way  and  much  of this  was  through  labour 
exchange.   
 
Generally,  livestock  production  (in  the  form  of  milk  and  meat)  made  only  a  very  small 
contribution  to  the  food  sources  of  most  households  in  these  zones.    Households  that 
owned  cattle  consumed smaller  quantities of  milk.   Slaughter  was  generally  restricted to 
goats (at times of festivals and funerals) and chickens.   
 
Wild foods (including  fruits  and tubers) played  an important role  as a  source  of  food  for 
poor  and  middle  households,  contributing  up  to 5-10%  of  annual  food  needs.    The  wild 
foods  that  were  consumed  in  average  and  good  years  were  not  considered  as  essential 
foods, and acted only as supplements.   
 
Relief  food  accounted  for  0-2%  of  caloric  food  needs  across  all  wealth  groups  in  the 
reference  year.   There  was no  sign of  geographical or  intra-community targeting.   Some 
villages received assistance within the districts visited and others did not, and this did not 
seem to be related to  required needs.  In villages where assistance had been provided, all 
households were reported receiving assistance.   

3.2.1  Household sources of income 
 
The  figures  3-15,  3-16  and  3-17  represents  the  major  sources  of  income  for  the  zones 
visited for the period March 2003 to April 2004. 

3.2.5.5  Sources of income for poor households 
 
The major income sources for the poor households were businesses such as beer brewing 
and crafts. The other major sources were crop sales and labour exchange. Income sources 
for  the  poor  households  were  generally  low,  below  ZMK1,  000,000  a  year  except  for 
isolated cases in Mulobezi woodlands, Chama-Lundazi and Mambwe-Petauke valley zone 
where income was between  ZMK1, 500,000 and ZMK2, 500,000. The high crop sales in 
Chama-Lundazi and Mambwe-Petauke were explained by accessibility to contract farming 
for  cotton  and  tobacco.  Livestock  sales  were  not  very  key  sources  of  income  across  the 
zones visited except in Zambezi East where sale of small ruminants was common. 

3.2.5.6  Sources of income for middle households 
 
Annual  income  for  middle  households  was  on  average  ZMK3, 000,000.  The  bulk  of  the 
income came from crop sales especially in those areas where there was contract farming of 
cotton,  tobacco  and  surplus  maize.  The  highest  income  levels  were  in  Mulobezi 
woodlands,  Zambezi  flood  plains  and  Chama-Lundazi  zones.  High  timber,  winter  maize 
and some surplus maize sales  explained this income trend respectively.  Labour  exchange 
also played a key role in contributing to incomes in some zones while livestock sales were 
generally low.  The  least  income  level  was in valley  areas like  Luano valley  and  Line  of 
rail  commercial  zones.  Small  businesses  were  another  major  income  for  middle 
households.

3.2.5.7  Sources of income for better-off households 
 
Key  sources  of  income  for  better-off  households  were  crop  and  livestock  sales.  The 
highest  incomes  were  in  zones  with  access  to  contract  farming  of  cotton  and  tobacco. 
Across  the  zones  the  maximum  yearly  income  was  under  ZMK10,  000,000  except  for 
Chama-Lundazi rice zone that recorded about ZMK20, 000,000. The other  major sources 
were from livestock sales and small businesses.

3.2.5.8  Analysis of sources of income 
 
The  main  source  of  cash  income  for  all  wealth  groups  was  crop  sales.  The  poor 
households additionally got their cash income from casual labour. Other sources included 
sale of vegetables, charcoal, wild foods, bush/handcrafts and gifts/remittances. 
 
The  better  off  households  got  more  income  from  crop  sales  mainly  due  to  comparative 
advantage of larger hectarage, use of draught power and capacity to hire  casual labour to 
work in the  fields.  Maize  sales  were  also  major  sources  of income  for  the  better  off  and 
medium bracket households. For the poor households maize was mostly for consumption. 
The better off households in most zones had a broader and  more diversified income base 
compared  to  the  poorer  households.  Income  from  cotton  sales  across  zones  was  an 
increasingly important source of cash for the other wealth groups. 
 
Labour exchange for poorer households was the highest contributor to income sources.  In 
most cases, labour was paid for in terms of food unless otherwise.  The sources of income 
in  the  livelihood  zone  as  depicted  in  Figure  3-15  shows  that  the  poor  households  were 

 

41

only able to get income from sale of chicken and other small livestock to raise money for 
household daily needs such as salt, grinding meal costs, hospital and clinic fee. 
 
The  medium rich households depended  more on crop and livestock product sales such  as 
milk,  for their  major  cash source. Livestock sales were a source of income  for all  wealth 
groups.   Poor households  sold chickens  and goats  (if  they had them)  whilst other groups 
(especially the better off) sold  cattle, goats, pigs, sheep and  even livestock products such 
as milk (and sometimes meat) to gain cash income.   
 
Petty trading  in  selling  of  vegetables  which  are  grown on  dambos  provided  considerable 
income  for  all  households.  Vegetables  were  grown  and  sold  by  households  in  all  wealth 
groups,  but  were  most  typical  for  poor  and  middle  households.    Beer  sales  were  major 
income  sources  for  most  poor  and  middle  households.  Beer  was  mainly  brewed  from 
sorghum and was dependent on the availability of sorghum and surplus maize. Most of the 
transactions in the zones were done through barter trade, which was the most predominant 
way of exchanging goods and services. 
 
Self-employment  formed  the  most  significant  source  of  income  for  poor  and  middle 
wealth  groups.    Self-employment  activities  included  bee  keeping  and  sale  of  honey, 
fishing, wild game hunting, beer selling, fine grass sales, and mat sales.   
 

3.2.6  Household expenditure patterns 

 
Different  expenditure  patterns  were  exhibited  in  different  livelihood  zones.  The  main 
ecological and economic  characteristics of the zone  were normally dictating the observed 
patterns. For example, in zones where crop and livestock agriculture was common, the key 
expenses  were  on agricultural  and/or  veterinary  inputs. Figures  3-18  and 3-19 shows the 
expenditure pattern for the Luano valley zone and the Line of rail commercial zone.  
 
Figure 3-18 represents the expenditure pattern for the households in the Luano valley zone 
from March 2003 to March 2004. The major expenditure for households in the valley were 
essential  household  items  like  salt,  soap,  kerosene;  grinding  and  firewood.  Most 
transactions  in  the  zone  are  by  barter  trading.  The  poorer  households  in  the  zone  hardly 
spent any of their income on agricultural inputs. 
 
In the  Line of rail commercial zone,  expenditure on staple  food for poor households  was 
almost the same  as for  middle households because they  obtained most of their purchased 
food-using  cash  earned  through  crop  sales  and  casual  work.    The  better-off  (rich) 
households had spent little on purchase of staple food due to their usually bountiful staple 
production.  As  a  result  of  their  relatively  high  income,  the  middle  and  better-off 
households  could  afford  to  buy  inputs,  which  included  fertilizer,  seed,  pesticides  and 
veterinary  drugs  compared  to  the  poor  households  who  could  not  afford.  The  category 
‘other  foods’  included  accompaniments  (relish),  sugar  and  oil.  The  expenditure  item 
‘Other  non-staple”  included  clothes,  soap,  grinding,  candles  (or  diesel/paraffin),  beer, 
utensils and other miscellaneous items.  Expenditure on most of these items increased with 
wealth.

As  depicted  in  Figure  3-20,  better-off  households  generally  spent  more  than  poorer 
households on almost all the items. Expenditure appeared to be positively correlated to the 
level of income. For the poor households, the major expense consisted of purchase of the 
staple, and   maize milling  expenses  which  was common among all the  wealth groups. In 
addition, expenses on staple  foods  were consistent across the wealth groups although the 
better  off usually  spent less. Other  consistent  expenditures  across wealth  groups  were  on 
health  and  essentials  like  salt  and  soap.  A  major  difference  among  wealth  groups  was 
observed  in  the  expenses  related  to  other  non-staples  like  health  and  education  items  on 
which  the  better  off  spent  significantly  more.  Education  featured  prominently  for  the 
middle  and  better  offs  attesting  to  the  fact  that  the  poor  more  often  than  not  have  only 
primary school going children most likely because it is costless in terms of school fees and 
other prerequisites.

Potential hazards in zones visited 

3.2.6.1  Chronic hazards 
 
In zones like Mufumbwe-Kasempa, Mambwe-Petauke and Chongwe-Nyimba human-wild 
animals  conflict  remains  a  major  problem.  The  proximity  of  game  parks  and  game 
management areas has led to areas on the periphery to suffer from crop damage especially 
by hippos and elephants. 
 
In zones that have a lot of livestock, such as those in southern, eastern and western parts of 
Zambia,  livestock  diseases  such  as  CBPP  remained  a  major  threat  to  cattle  rearing.  In 
cases  such  as  those  in  western  Zambia,  diseases  are  endemic  resulting  in  periodic 
restrictions  on  cattle  movement.  In  eastern  Zambia  the  African  Swine  Fever  has 
consistently  reduced  the  population  of  pigs  while  the  Newcastle  disease  has  consistently 
attacked chickens. Cattle diseases, for example, expose owners to impacts related to asset 
base  erosion,  thus  affecting  future  response  strategies  that  involve  cattle  as  food  or  as  a 
source of income.  Secondly, diseases reduce draught power for higher crop hectares thus 
further reducing expected yields. 

3.2.6.2  Periodic hazards 
 
The  main  periodic  hazard  in  the  zones  visited  was  erratic  rainfall.  This  was  in  terms  of 
long dry spells, few rain days with high rainfall amounts or generally inadequate rainfall. 
This always tended to create transitory food insecurity in most zones. 
 
In  zones  such  as  the  Luano  valley  and  Zambezi  flood  plains,  excessive  rainfall  causes 
localized  floods  and  subsequently  water  logging  that  submerges  crops.  In  Zambezi  east 
zone  water  logging  results  in  cassava  rotting,  disturbing  access  to  the  main  staple  food. 
Due  to  persistent  floods  in  some  zones,  the  main  crops  are  grown  along  the  riverbanks 
where  there  is  a  lot  of  silt  and  moisture.  This  usually  destroys  the  first  crop  and  the 
households  have  to  wait  for  two  to  five  months  before  they  go  for  second  planting  and 
harvest from the second  crop. The period in between the  first planting and the harvest of 
the  second  planting  is  when  most  households  are  food  insecure.  The  floods  mean  that 
household  will  not  have  food  for  the  first  planting  season  to  the  second  planting  season 
until the second harvest.  
 
Crop diseases particularly, the larger grain borer infestation of stored grain was common 
in most zones. Poor crop marketing and input distribution had lead to reduced incomes in 
many  households  in  most  zones  visited.  Farmers  in  most  zones  always  pointed  out  how 
the market system disadvantaged them 

3.2.7  Coping or response strategies 

 
In  the  Central  maize-cotton  zone,  when  hazards  affect  the  area,  production  of  both  food 
and cash crops gets affected. For the poor the main response when hit with drought/floods 
is to increase casual labour in commercial farmers and to the better off households. For the 
better off and  medium households, the  main response to reduced rainfall and drought has 
been sale of livestock to make up for the loss in income and food shortfall. When livestock 
diseases attack the zones, the farmers turn towards massive selling of livestock. 
 

 

45

The  major  coping strategy in Luano valley  was dependency on  wild fruits, and increased 
casual labour to those in formal employment. With limited livelihood options and limited 
cash transactions, coping strategies were very limited in the Luano valley.  
 
In  Kazungula-Mwandi  zone,  most  affected  households  were  the  poor.  In  most  of  the 
months  of  the  year  these  worked  in  the  fields  of  the  medium  and  the  well  off  for  their 
livelihood.  The  poor  wealth  group  coped  with  the  drought  situation  by  sale  of  casual 
labour,  increased  sale  of  bush products such  as bundles  of grass, making of  reed  mats, s 
and  increased beer brewing.  The  middle  households  coped  with  the  drought  situation  by 
selling the last season crop stocks, selling of livestock and small business trading. Some of 
the medium wealth group were involved in casual work, and beer brewing had increased. 
 
In Mulobezi woodlands zone the poor coped by casual work (land  clearing and weeding) 
for the better offs, and seeking work as domestic workers, increased sale of bush products 
such  as  bundles  of  grass,  making  of  reed  mats,  increased  beer  brewing  and  increased 
prostitution.  The  medium  and  the  well  off  wealth  group  sold  livestock  products  and 
engaged in gardening. Most of the people depended on last season (2003-04) crop harvest 
and cross-border trading with Namibia. The poor were coping by working for medium and 
richer wealth groups in Zambezi flood plain zone.  The medium households also work for 
well off wealth group and engage in petty trade. The richer are selling livestock. There is a 
complaint  that  the  buyers  are  paying  less  for  their  livestock.  Other  responses  are  sale  of 
bush products. 
 
In  Sioma  the  poor  coped  with  the  drought  situation  through  casual  labour,  wild  fruit 
collection  and  relief  food;  stealing  is  quite  rife  in  the  villages  worst  affected  by  the 
drought. The medium and the richer wealth group relied on last season’s crop harvest. One 
strategy  that  is  commonly  employed  in  bad  years  is  to  reduce  on  non-essential 
expenditures.   Households  reported  reducing  expenditure  on  clothes,  grinding, relish  and 
other non-staple items in bad years.   
 
In the line of  rail commercial zone, all wealth groups attempted to  expand their food and 
income sources that are less directly affected by the hazard in bad years.  For example, the 
collection  of  wild  foods  expands  in  bad  years,  both  for  consumption  and  for  sale. 
However,  the  poor  households  in  the  current  survey  did  not  reflect  this  expandability  in 
their responses. Livestock sales also increase in bad years. The wealthier households are in 
a  better  position  to  exploit  this  strategy  since  they  own  more  livestock.  Migration  of 
individual  household  members  in  search  of  employment  within  the  zone  is  a  common 
strategy in bad years, generally employed by poor and middle households.  The success of 
this  strategy  partly  depended  on  the  extent  to  which  neighbouring  areas  within  the  zone 
were  also  affected  by  the  hazard  in  a  particular  year.    Other  coping  strategies  included 
local casual labour, fishing, petty trade, reducing expenditure on education in order to buy 
food  and  parents  sending  children  (pupils)  to  do  piece  work  and  earn  money  or  food 
instead of encouraging them to go to school. 
 
In Mufumbwe-Kasempa zone, the poors’  response  to  erratic  rainfall  is  mainly by  selling 
off  their  labour  for  food.  In  extreme  cases  the  selling  of  labour  goes  beyond  the  normal 
agricultural labour calendar. Reducing the number of meals is very common amongst the 
wealth  groups.  The  middle  wealth  group  mainly  relied  on  their  livestock  and  some  cash 
crops  to  meet  food  deficits  that  may  arise.  The  major  forest  product  among  this  wealth 
group was honey from bee keeping.  

 

46

 
Sale  of  livestock,  and  barter  for  food  were  common  response  strategies  for  all  wealth 
groups.  In  Chama-Lundazi  zone,  the  common  strategies  for  the  poor  were  beer  brewing 
and cross border trade with Malawi. The middle and wealthier groups engaged in livestock 
sales.  In  Mambwe-Petauke  zone,  the  poor  households  responded  to  hazards  by  seeking 
casual labour on several tourist lodges in the game park. Others engaged in limited fishing 
and  sale  of  bush products.  The  middle  households  engaged  in  casual  labor  on  better  off 
farms and tourist lodges. In the Eastern province  cash  crop zone  coping strategies  for the 
poor  households  included  beer  brewing  and  mat  making.  The  middle  and  better  off 
households  hired  out  their  assets,  like  scotching  carts  and  also  engaged  in  cross  border 
trade with Malawi. 

3.2.8 

Indicators of imminent crisis 

 
Key  crisis  indicators  in  the  zones  revolved  around  the  rainfall  pattern.  Each  time  the 
rainfall delayed in coming or became intermittent or inadequate, it spelt potential problems 
for  the  agricultural  season.  In  the  valley  areas,  like  Luano  valley,  too  much  rainfall 
indicated an impeding crisis that normally happens in the months of January and February. 
Drought  indications  in  Luano  valley  show  when  there  is  a  delay  in  the  start  of  the  rain 
season and long dry spells in January and February. 
 
Another key indicator of a crisis is reduction in uptake of casual labour employment by the 
medium and the well off. High staple food prices after harvest season is also an indicator 
of  a  pending  crisis.  In  some  cases  increased  cattle  movement  to  wetlands  is  another 
indicator.    In  other  zones,  crisis  indicators  included  increased  livestock  sales  after  the 
staple crop harvest and  reduced livestock prices as the season progressed. Increased wild 
food  collection,  especially  after  harvest,  was  another  common  indicator  of  a  pending 
crisis. 
 
In  some  zones  that  border  urban  areas,  like  Chongwe-Nyimba,  migration  of  household 
members  to  neighbouring  towns  and  commercial  farm  areas  was  another  indicator  of  a 
crisis.  In  Chama-Lundazi  and  Kazungula-Mwandi  zones  some  individuals  migrated  to 
Malawi and Namibia respectively in search of work on better off farms. 
 
The likely deficits as a result of the poor performance of the current season will, however, 
would be mitigated by the stated coping strategies that households employ.  In some cases 
the entire deficit could be covered completely.  
 
3.3  Rural vulnerability 

3.3.1  Cereal Gap Analysis 

 
Requirement  for  external  food  aid  is  determined  by  the  degree  of  access  to  local  foods. 
This in turn is influenced by the availability of local foods (e.g. in the market or from own 
production)  and  the  purchasing  power.  Further  it  is  also  influenced  by  the  opportunities 
available to the affected population (e.g. for direct purchase from local sources or  for the 
purchase  of  food  where  production  is  possible  and  allowed).  The  interplay  of  these 
attributes assist to determine the population in need. 
 

 

47

Using a food gap analysis, the assessment established that a total population of 1,232,661 
people would require assistance in the districts shown in Table 3.6 (see also Figure 3-21). 
A  total  of 118,335  MT of  cereal  is required  for  a  period of  8  months, from July  2005  to 
February  2006.  This  food  intervention  will  provide  70%  of  the  recommended  2100 
kilocalories per capita requirement. Therefore in addition to cereal, it is recommended that 
those planning to assist these affected households programme for additional  foods rich in 
protein and oils, consistent with nutritional needs. Table 3-6 shows the actual breakdown, 
in  terms  of  cereal  needs,  per  district.  The  month  of  June  2005  is  reserved  for  logistical 
preparation by concerned agencies.

The proposed period of intervention is meant to coincide with the start of the green harvest 
which normally contributes substanicially to filling the food gap.  
 
The  highest  population  at    risk  are  in  Chibombo  and  Petauke  with  over  100,000 person. 
The districts with fewer people at risk are Livingstone, Luangwa and Chavuma. 
 
Seven  (7)  districts  have  been  recommended  for  monitoring  in  terms  of  evolving  food 
security  situation.  Some  districts  (six)  that  where  equally  affected  by  the  hazard  where 
found to be less  severely  impacted and  may  not require  immediate  attention  (Table 3-7).  
The  districts  under  monitoring  have  access  to  contract  farming  and  their  seasonal 
calendars  portray  consistent  cash  inflows  through  out  the  year.  These  factors  contribute 
substantially to their incomes and food needs.

The  seven  listed  districts  will  remain  under  monitoring  during  the  2005/06  marketing 
season. Indicators to monitor include cereal prices (sharp price increases), unusual sale of 
productive  assets  and  reduction  in  livestock  prices  (panic  selling).  The  less  affected 
districts  will  be  able  to  cope  without  outside  assistance  through  employing  their  normal 
coping  mechanisms.  Most  of  the  districts  which  are  least  affected  historically  receive 
relatively more rainfall even in bad years. 

3.3.2  Targeting  

 
Targeting of the most vulnerable should use a combination of social and economic criteria. 
For  district  wise  targeting,  there  is  need  for  coordination  among  the  key  players 
(Government,  NGOs, UN  system and  community representatives) to  agree on  appropriate 
targeting guidelines. According to survey results there is need to carry out post distribution 
monitoring in areas that will be targeted  for food aid. In dealing with targeting, the survey 
recommends that the following aspects are considered:  

3.3.2.1  Protecting lives for those within the rural (cash and barter) economies   
  
While a  food intervention in the  months  ahead  will  certainly  compensate  for  food  losses 
resulting  from  drought,  the  loss of  income due to drought  for  those  within  the  rural  cash 
economy must  be  mitigated  as  well.  The  survey 
targeting 
modalities, local  purchase,  and  seed  availability  choices  should  reinforce changes  in  the 
pattern  of production,  and  income  incentives  that  reduce  risk  through the  increased 
production  of  agro-ecologically  suitable  crops  in  combination  with  greater  crop  and 
income  diversification.  For  example,  those  living  within  the rural  barter  economy, 
livestock provide some measure of protection.  

recommends 

that 

3.3.2.2  Protecting lives for the economically vulnerable  
  
Recognizing  that there  are  high  and  low  income  groups  among  the geographically 
vulnerable,  the  primary  benefit  of  a  risk  reduction  approach  would  accrue  to  those  with 
access  to  land  and  other  attributes  of  wealth.  Therefore  those facing  labour  shortages 
through  taking  care  of  the  chronically  ill  (e.g.  HIV  AIDS  affected  households) 
would require other forms of protection. In addition, low income households in rural areas 
facing  higher  food  prices  will  also  require protection  that  would  be afforded  through 
expanded access to lower cost food items. 

3.3.3  Programming Strategies  

3.3.3.1  Free Food or Food for Work 

 

Within the Government's policy to encourage food for work, a focus on work that reduces 
the production risks should be emphasized with modifications where necessary. Free food 
should be accessed by socially and economically disadvantaged such as the chronically ill, 
aged, child headed households, widows and disabled and not able to work.  
  
 
 
 

 

50

3.3.3.2  Choice of commodity 
 
There is need to provide food aid in a form that might help to encourage consumption 
diversification where possible blending of foods should be encouraged.  

3.3.3.3  Cash transfer 
 
Since food aid needs by definition are intended to address the consumption shortfall, the 
question that still needs to be addressed is what should be done to offset the income loss 
that also occurs in most vulnerable households. As such options for cash transfers would 
make sense where markets are available. For example, the WFP Local Purchase Program 
of 2005 could assist to provide a stimulus in such markets.

4.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
The  fact  that  there  is  a  high  dependency  on  own  production  as  a  source  of  food 
(accounting for at least 80 percent of all cereals used by the household) suggests that rural 
households are highly vulnerable to factors that affect production, such as poor rains. This 
fact  has  been  underscored  by  the  fact  that  the  poor  rains  received  this  (2004/05) 
agricultural season have resulted in substantial reductions in quantity of cereals produced 
in all the livelihood zones. Therefore, it is important for the government, the private sector 
and  all  other  agricultural  stakeholders  to  re-look  at  their  strategies  and  consider,  among 
other  things,  medium-  to  long-term  interventions  that  could  improve  these  farmers’ 
abilities  to  forecast  the  drought  and/or  to  implement  technologies  and  management 
practices  that  could  reduce  production  risk.  Irrigation  and  other  management  practices 
(early planting,  conservation  agriculture, and  other  water-conserving technologies)  might 
be some of the interventions to be considered. 
 
The study has identified a substantial number of households that might be in need of direct 
intervention,  given  the  effects  of  this  year’s  poor  rains.  Although  specific  interventions 
can best be identified and their effectiveness measured through a comprehensive appraisal 
exercise, an attempt is made in the lines that follow to provide some suggestions, drawing 
from experiences and lessons learnt through this study. 
 
4.1 Food based interventions in the short term 
 
4.1.1 Food Relief 
  Preparations  for  food  relief  intervention  should  commence  in  line  with  the 
recommended time frame of July 2005 to February 2006 in the districts highlighted in 
Figure  3-21. The  options  on interventions  should aim to protect  livelihoods  for  those 
within  the  rural  (cash  and  barter  economies)  and  should  also  protect  those 
economically vulnerable. Programming strategies should encompass options related to 
free food or food for work, choice of commodity and cash transfer options. 

  Phase  down  strategies  should  not  disrupt  the  built  capacities  and  livelihood  options 

resulting thereafter. 

 
4.1.1.1 Targeting/Monitoring of food relief 
 
  Targeting  of  the  most  vulnerable  should  use  a  combination  of  social  and  economic 

criteria 

  Coordination of GRZ/UN/NGO and communities in targeting. 
  A  review  of  targeting  guidelines  to  improve  the  following  aspects;  criteria  for 
beneficiary  selection  and  verification;  guidelines  for  use  of  community  based 
structures  for  distribution;  clear  structures  for  monitoring  a)  distribution  b)  post-
distribution and c) impact and guidelines for joint monitoring by organizations at each 
level: community, district and national level (bottom up). 

  Re-orient  all  stakeholders  (Government,  NGOs,  community 

leaders,  satellite 
committees,  District  Disaster  Management  Committees  (DDMC)  on  targeting 
guidelines.

4.1.2 Nutrition 
 
  Enhancement  of  supplementary  feeding  programmes  using  HEPS  and  therapeutic 
feeding programmes following international standards in serious and risky zones (See 
Annex 6).   

 
4.2 Non food based interventions in the short term  
 
4.2.1 Food Security 
  Conduct  an  impact  assessment  of  the  input  support  programmes  to  ascertain  their 

benefit in improving livelihoods. 

Immediate cattle vaccinations as animals share limited water resources.  

  Promotion of organic farming to reduce the risk of disease outbreak. 
 
  Support and enhance disease control programmes especially for cattle (CBPP, FMD). 
 
4.2.2 Water 
There  is  need  to  enhance  the  current  interventions  in  water  treatment  such  as  use  of 
chlorine  and  boiling  of  water  before  drinking  since  two  thirds  of  the  respondents  in  the 
survey  used  unsafe  water  sources.  There  is  a  need  to  sustain  water  availability  in  the 
affected zones through water monitoring. Develop programs for provision of safe water to 
valleys and far flung areas.  
 
4.2.3 Education 
  Sustain girl child education programs especially in the valley areas.  
  Sensitize guardians on equal access to education for both gender and discourage early 

marriage for girls.  

  Reduce drop outs through extending programmes such as school feeding. 
 
4.2.4 Nutrition 
  The results of under five malnutrition rates shows the need  for urgent attention in the 
following  identified  zones;  Mambwe-Petauke  Valley  (12B),  Mufumbwe-Kasempa 
(3A),  Chama-Lundazi  rice  (4B)  and  Eastern  province  cash  crop  (5B),  Zambezi  East 
(10B),  Sioma plain (6) and Chongwe-Nyimba plateau (7B). Capacity should be built 
for  health  care  providers  in  the  management  of  moderate  and  severe  cases  of 
malnutrition  in  the  identified  zones.  Management  of  childhood  illnesses  in  those 
affected  areas  should  also  be  priotised.  In  addition  nutrition  programs  that  target 
households in the area of diet diversity and food processing should be enhanced.  
In addition there is need for improved management of child illnesses. Emphasis should 
be on children aged 6 to 23 months.  

 

 
4.3 Medium and long term interventions 
 
4.3.1 Food security 
  For recurrent floods and droughts, permanent solutions to be sought through integrated 
water  management  schemes  such  as  simple  irrigation  techniques  for  agriculture  and 
small  dams  for livestock. In  addition  promotion  of  drought-tolerant  crops  and   water 
harvesting techniques must be intensified. 

  Support for sustainable agricultural production that are based on food security such as 
conservation  farming.  Cassava  based  research  to  be  intensified  for  continued

availability  of  the  crop  through  out  the  year  through  superior  varieties  that  are  high 
yielding. 

  Promote  restocking  schemes  and  other  agricultural  loans  schemes  that  are  carefully 
tailored to areas  with  frequent  bad  years.  This however should  go hand  in  hand  with 
promotion of good animal husbandry practices. 

  Appropriate  road  rehabilitation  programs  must  be  pursued  in  areas  with  poor  road 

infrastructure to promote production and marketing.  

 
4.3.2 Nutrition 
  Further assessment should be conducted to investigate the high proportions of bilateral 

oedema in Kazungula-Mwandi plain (zone 7A). 

  A  baseline  investigation  of  the  inter-linkages  between  food  security,  health  and 
nutrition  in  areas  where  prevalence  of  under-five  malnutrition  is  low  such  as  the 
Central Maize-Cotton (zone 4A) is recommended. 

  Existing nutrition programmes should be enhanced to promote / include training in 

food processing and diet diversity. 

 
4.3.3 Health 
 

Implementation of activities in on-going programmes that are addressing management 
and  treatment  of  chronic  illnesses  including  preventative  health  care  must  be 
enhanced.  

  Management of child illness in redspot areas with child malnutrition.

Annex 3 Continued 
 

Notes on the Food Balance Sheet 

  

E.  Food aid import requirements  12/ 
1/  Stocks expected to be held by commodity traders, millers, FRA and commercial farmers as at May 2003, 

    

2/ 

NOT including stocks held by small-scale farmers in rural areas. 
Production estimates from MACO/CSO. Cassava production is based on the total area under cassava, 
using an annual yield figure 
of 11.7 tonnes per hectare (MAFF Root and Tuber Improvement Programme, 1996). A flour extraction 
rate of 25% is used. Other tubers are sweet potatoes and Irish potatoes. 

3/  Urban production of maize is estimated at 6.61% of rural smallholder production, based on 1998 Living 

Conditions Monitoring Survey's urban respondents who cultivated one hectare of maize or less. 

  

  

  

  

4/  Staple foods are assumed to represent 70% (1,421 kCal/person/day) of total diet (2,030 kCal/person/day), 

converted to crop requirements for the national 2003/04 population of 10.11 million people. The maize 
grain and cassava meal surplus represents an overall surplus of staple foods. Cross-substitution may 
make this surplus partly available in the form of other crops. 

5/  Locally purchased FRA stocks expected to be carried over into the next season.(this does not indicate 

total FRA purchases on the local market nor imports) 

6/  Estimated requirements by major stockfeed producers. 
7/  Estimated requirements by industrial breweries. 
8/  Estimated seed crop grown for seed companies. 
9/  Post harvest losses are estimated at 5% for grains and sweet potatoes, and 2% for cassava. 
10/  Expected surplusses or deficits that arise after meeting minimum overall staple human consumption 

requirements as well as industrial requirements. Cassava and maize surpluses may be substitutable with 
other crops and may result in different exportable volumes than the ones indicated here.The rice deficit is 
based on what is known to be imported each year, as indicated under D.The wheat deficit is based on the 
estimated market size as indicated in B, less availability as indicated in A. 

11/  Imports required to be made by the private sector to meet the commercial market demands. 
12/  Total estimated requirement for food relief among vulnerable groups, to be imported. This could be met 

with maize or other grains.
