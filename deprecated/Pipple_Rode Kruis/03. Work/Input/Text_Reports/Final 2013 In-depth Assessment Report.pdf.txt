Executive Summary 

The  performance  of  the  2012/2013  rainy  season  was  mixed  with  the  Northern  parts  of  the 
country experiencing an early onset (October 2012) while the Southern  half  experienced a  late 
onset (November/December 2012) coupled with prolonged dry spells in the middle of the season 
that led to infestation of army worms..   

 

In light of the above, need arose to conduct an in-depth vulnerability assessment to establish the 
extent  of  the  problem  and  recommend  appropriate  interventions  in  forty-four  (44)  districts  of 
Central, Eastern, Lusaka, Luapula, Muchinga, Northern, North-Western, Southern and  Western 
Provinces.  

 

The  assessment  used  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  approaches  in  the  collection  of  data.  A 
total of 6, 600 households in 660 standard enumeration areas (SEAs) in forty- four (44) districts 
were assessed. Under the quantitative approach, structured household questionnaires were used 
in  all the SEAs while under the qualitative approach, community  interviews were conducted in 
all the SEAs with one interview per district conducted in each of the districts assessed.  

 

Major Findings 

•  According  to the  assessment,  24  percent of  the  interviewed  households  indicated  that they 
were  warned  of  the  impending  floods  and  dry  spells.  The  assessment  established  that  the 
mode  of  communication  through  which  the  early  warning  information  was  received  was 
mainly Radio and Television.  

•  Maize  production  contributed  86  percent  of  all  staple  food  produced  while  production  of 

other crops was almost insignificant.  

•  Among the assessed households in forty four districts, 66 percent purchased/acquired inputs 
(seed and fertilizer) during the 2012/13 production season. While the FISP program to some 
extent  increased  input  access  for  the  target  farmers  (25  percent),  the  major  source  for 
acquiring  inputs  was  through  market  purchases  (40  percent).  However  the  quantities 
purchased/acquired were far below the requirement as only 45 percent of these households 
had adequate inputs for the main cereal crops. 

•  Majority of households (93 percent) in the assessed districts grew cereals while the share of 

cassava was very low at 9 percent. 

•  Majority  of  maize  producing  areas  recorded  a  major  drop  in  the  production  of  this  cereal, 
with the Southern Province recording the largest maize production drop at 21percent mainly 
due to the late start of season and erratic rainfall. 

• 

 

In  terms  of  health,  about  71  percent  reported  a  household  member  falling  sick  during  the 
period January –March 2013. 

ix

 

•  There  was  a  difference  in  Respiratory  Infection  Non-Pneumonia  (RTI)  data  collected  last 
two weeks prior to the assessment and those from January to March 2013 in that more RTI 
cases were than it was during the period January to March 2013. 

•  The Assessment revealed that the main source of drinking water was borehole (41  percent), 
followed  by  unprotected  wells  (22    percent),  piped  water  (16    percent),  river/lake  (13  
percent)  with  protected  well  being  one  of  the  least  sources.    In  terms  of  variances  in  the 
sources  of  drinking  water  by  locality,  the  assessment  has  shown  that  of  the  households 
whose main source of drinking water was borehole, 46  percent resided in the rural strata of 
the assessed districts compared to 24  percent from the urban. 

•  The assessment has shown that the majority (68  percent) of the households use traditional 

latrines followed by those that opted for no facility (21  percent). 

•  The results have shown that only 2  percent of the assessed households indicated having 1-2 
school  going  male  children  being  absent  from  school  while  less  than  1    percent  indicated 
that  3 or  more  male  children  were  absent  from  school  due  to  floods.  On  the  other  hand  3 
percent of the households from the assessed districts indicated that 1-2 school going female 
children were absent while less than 1 percent indicated that 3or more female children were 
absent from school due to floods. 

•  The  assessment  further  revealed  that  only  13  percent  of  the  households  from  the  assessed 
districts  indicated  receiving  social  safety  net  support,  however  limited  coverage  was  the 
major concern. Further, of those households that indicated receiving some form of safety net 
support,  only  33  percent  indicated  that  the  support  was  adequate.  The  common  form  of 
safety  net  accessed  by  the  assessed  households  was  input  support  which  accounted  for  77 
percent of households. 

The assessment established that 4 percent of the households  in the districts affected by the 
floods were displaced. This translates into a total of 345 households (2, 070 people) in three 
districts namely Chibombo, Mumbwa and Zambezi. 

 

Recommendations 

Early Warning and Preparedness Measures 

Short term 

•  Conduct  sensitization  campaigns  on  the  need  to  take  appropriate  preparedness  and 

mitigation measures upon receipt of early warning information. 

•  Review the packaging of early warning information for easy interpretation by end users.  

 
 
 

 

x

 

Medium to Long term 

•  Expand the coverage of the hydro-meteorological station network. 

•  Expand  the  radio  coverage  in  all  the  districts  in  the  country  such  as  community  radio 

stations as they are the most viable mode of disseminating early warning information. 

•  Expand  the  television  coverage  in  all  the  districts  in  the  country  in  order  to  enhance 

access to early warning information by all citizens. 

• 

 Establish community led early warning infrastructure and systems. 

 

Agriculture and Food Security 

Short Term: 

•  Owing to the reduced nutritional levels that livestock will experience in the course of the 
2013/14  consumption  season,  it  is  recommended  that  livestock  disease  surveillance  be 
enhanced and/or strengthened. This is in view of dwindling pasture land which will result 
in overcrowding of livestock in areas that will have pasture. 

•  To  help  reduce  the  food  deficit  during  the  year,  it  is  recommended  that  those  districts 
already  practicing  off  season  production  of  mainly  vegetables  be  given  inputs  to  help 
revamp  the  practice.  The  input  support  should  use  the  e-voucher  system  for  the 
distribution of the commodities to beneficiaries. 

• 

It  is  recommended  that  deliberate  effort  be  made  to  ensure  FISP  is  broadened  to  help 
increase crop diversification.  

•  A  total  of  209,  498  people  (34,  916  households)  be  provided  with  food  support (maize 
equivalent)  amounting  to  12,  570  MT  in  18  districts  for the  period  of  eight  (8)  months 
starting 1st August 2013 through to 31st March 2013. Twenty percent (20 percent) of the 
caseload to be under General Food Distribution (chronically vulnerable). 

•  There is need to monitor the evolution of the food security situation in 18 districts that are 

on the borderline as well as those targeted for food support. 

 

Medium to Long Term 

• 

It is recommended that the extension services be enhanced to promote farmers production 
of fodder/silage to provide additional food for livestock during the dry season. 

 

xi

 

•  There will be need for Government to conduct livestock restocking which should include 

enhancing of livestock management to ensure livestock does not become lean.  

•  Promotion  of  conservation  farming  and  use  of  manure  to  increase  productivity  in 

marginal producing districts.  

• 

In view of the climate change effects that the country has already started experiencing, it 
is  recommended  to  design  and  implement  adaptation  programmes  such  as  use  of 
appropriate seed varieties and farming technologies. 

Health 

Short-term 

•  Strengthen  Community  Health  Promotion  and  behavioural  changes  activities  in  all  the 

affected districts.  

•  Development, procurement and distribution of Information Education and Communication 

(IEC) materials. 

•  Prevent and improve case management of malaria, diarrhoeal diseases and RTI in all the district 

reporting high incidences especially in children 0-59months of age.  

•  Strengthen  implementation  of  the  Integrated  Management  of  Child  Illnesses  (IMCI) 

strategy. 

•  Provision of Insecticide Treated Mosquito Nets (ITNs) for prevention of vector – human 

contact. 

•  Provision of Rapid Diagnostic Testing Kits (RDTs) for easy and early detection of positive 

cases of Malaria.  

•  Provision of essential drugs (anti-malarial drugs) for the treatment of malaria cases. 
•  Strengthen community participation in good hygiene practices and waste disposal to 

prevent diarrhoeal diseases. 

 

Medium to Long-term 

•  Strengthen malaria intervention, in accordance with National Health Strategic Plan. 
• 

Implement Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST) methodology 
to improve community health. 
Improve access to health services through the strengthening of the primary health care 
system and Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) outreach programs providing 
immunization, vitamin A supplementation and behavior change communication on  early 
health seeking behaviur especially for children under the age of five. 
Initiate/ expand programs to provide surveillance for notifiable diseases such as 
Diarrrhoel diseases. 

• 

• 

•  Rehabilitation of Health Infrastructure those would be affected and flood affected health 

facilities. 

 

xii

 

Water and Sanitation 

Short – term 

•  Accelerate  water  supply  investments  in  all  districts  as  an  integrated  package  with 
sanitation  which  should  include  construction  and  improvement  of  water  points 
(boreholes, hand dug wells, springs, and traditional water sources). 

•  Rehabilitation of existing water points which are in a deplorable state. 
•  Roll-out  to  all  districts  the  operation  and  maintenance  system  for  water  points  from 

• 

district to community level.  
Increase availability of chlorine at household to enhance treatment of water for drinking 
in all the affected districts. 

 

Medium and Long term 

•  Formulate the Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) Policy and review Legal Framework, 

taking into considerations of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Act. 

•  Strengthen  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  activities  in  Commercial 
Utilities  (CUs)  and  Local  Authorities  (LAs)  to  ensure  effective  service  delivery  at 
national, district and community levels.  

•  Establish  knowledge  sharing  and  facilitating  centers  to  spearhead  research  and 
development  on  appropriate  design  of  technologies;  piloting  and  wide  promotion  of 
technically appropriate service delivery mechanisms. 

•  Promote  rainwater  harvesting  facilities  and  spring  protection  and  utilization  to  improve 

access to safe drinking water. 
 

Sanitation 
Short – term 

•  Construct  demonstration  latrines  at  rural  community  centres  at  strategic  points  such  as 
schools,  markets,  faith  centres,  and  traditional  chiefs’  villages.  This  will  provide  an 
opportunity to demonstrate appropriate technologies which the communities can adopt to 
improve their sanitation facilities. 
 

Medium and Long Term 

•  Promote  integrated  development  and  management  of  water  supply,  sanitation  and 
hygiene  education  based  on  the  WASHE  (Water,  Sanitation  and  Hygiene  Education) 
strategy. 

•  Roll out Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) in rural areas to increase and improve 
the  number  of  adequate  sanitation  facilities  by  encouraging  communities  to  construct 
latrines and promote health and hygiene education. 
Implement existing government policy on sanitation and hygiene facilities that encourage 
construction  of  adequate  latrine  structures  using  locally  available  materials  in  rural 
districts.  

• 

 

 

 

xiii

 

Education 

Short Term: 

•  Rehabilitation  of  damaged  school  infrastructure  to  ensure  children  return  to  school  as 

soon as the floods reside. 

•  Expansion  of  school  feeding  programmes  in  36  districts  of  Central,  Eastern,  Luapula, 

Lusaka, Muchinga, Western and North-Western provinces. 

 

Medium to Long Term 

• 

Inclusion  of  issues  on  climate  change  adaptation  and  disaster  risk  management  in  the 
curriculum.  

•  Upgrading  of  temporary  school  infrastructure  such  as  community  schools  to  permanent 

status to ensure stability even in times of floods. 

 Ensure  constant  monitoring  of  on-going  infrastructure  development  for  quality 
assurance. 

• 

 

Social Protection 

•  Provide  social  cash  transfers  to  affected  households  for  them  access  other  basics  needs 
such as health, transport other than food where much of their expenditures go. Priority to 
be the 20% of the households targeted for the general food distribution. 

 

Habitation and Human Shelter 

•  There is need to sensitize populations residing in flood prone areas on the importance of 

relocating to higher grounds. 

•  Sensitize  populations  on  alternative  sustainable  livelihood  sources  especially  those 

engaged in fishing.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

1.1. Background 
The  performance  of  the  2012/2013  rainy  season  was  mixed  with  the  Northern  parts  of  the 
country experiencing an early onset (October 2012) while the Southern  half  experienced a  late 
onset  (November/December  2012).  The  dry  spell  that  started  in  the  last  dekad  of  February 
persisted into March 2013 affecting the Southern half of the country. Outbreaks of army worms 
were also experienced in some parts of the country during the mid- season due to the persistent 
dry spells. 

In light of the above, need arose to conduct an in-depth vulnerability assessment in the affected 
areas  to  establish  the  extent  of  the  problem  and  recommend  appropriate  interventions  in  forty-
four  (44)  districts  of    Central,  Eastern,  Lusaka,  Luapula,  Muchinga,  Northern,  North-Western, 
Southern and Western Provinces.  

 The  data  collection  for  the  impact  assessment  was  commissioned  on  the  28th  April,  2013  and 
took 30 days to complete.  

 

1.2. Objectives 

    1.2.1 Overall Objective 

The  overall  objective  of  the  In  –  depth  Assessment  was  to  assess  the  impacts  of  dry  –  spells, 
floods and army worms on selected sectors of the economy during the 2012/2013 rainfall season 
in  the  affected  parts  of  the  country  in  order  to  ascertain  the  extent  of  the  damage  and  design 
appropriate response and rehabilitation measures.   
 

    1.2.2 Specific Objectives 

The following were the specific objectives: 

i.  Determine the impact of dry spells and rainfall on WATSAN, Health, food and nutrition 

security, education and infrastructure; 
Identify worst affected areas as well as the population affected; 

ii. 
iii.  Determine food and non-food needs if any; and 
iv.  Determine the community preparedness to hazards.   
  

1.3 Scope of the In-Depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment 

In determining the districts to assess, the following criteria were developed: 

i.  Rainfall: 

 

1

 

a.  Start of season anomaly  showing  areas whose onset was delayed  by at least 

two dekads;  

b.  Rainfall performance in the months of December 2012, January, February and 

March 2013 (based on the dekadal and monthly);and 

c.  Analysis  of 

  satellite 

imagery  products  namely;  Water  Requirement 
Satisfaction  Index  (WRSI),  Soil  Water  Index  (SWI)  and  the  Total  Water 
Surplus (TWS); 

ii.  Crop performance: 

a.  Ministry of Agriculture percentage estimated crop yield loss based on the crop 

monitoring;  

b.  Reports on army worms infestations; and   
c.  Secondary reports from agricultural district field staff 
 

The broader themes covered in the Assessment included the following:  
 

Household Questionnaire themes covered were as follows:  

Infrastructure 

•  Household Demographics  
•  Education

    1.4. Limitations of the Survey 

The strength of this study is that it used a statistically valid multi-stage sampling scheme, which 
recognizes  the  heterogeneity  of  the  livelihood  zones  as  a  basis  for  the  first  stage  of  sampling. 
However, owing to the  duration for conducting the assessment, no listing of households in the 
randomly selected enumeration areas was done hence leaving some households with no chance 
of being selected. This could have ultimately introduced bias in the data collected. 

 

At the time of the survey, the district level population projections emanating from the 2010 
Census were not finalised thereby leading to under-estimation of projected figures. 

  

1.5. Methods and Procedures 
 

    1.5.1. Survey Methodology  

The  2013  In-Depth  Assessment  targeted  people  living  in  the  districts  identified  to  have  been 
affected by dry spells, floods or army worm attacks during the 2012/2013 rainfall season.  A total 
of forty – four (44) districts were targeted in eight provinces (see Annex 1 for the map). 

The  sampling  main  frame  used  was  a  listing  of  Standard  Enumeration  Areas  (SEAs)  in  all  the 
forty-four (44) districts. This list was obtained from the Central Statistical Office (CSO).  
 
About 650 SEAs were sampled using a stratified two-stage sampling method. In the first stage, 
15  SEAs  were  selected  using  Probability  Proportional  to  Estimated  Size  (PPES)  procedure. 
During the second stage, 10 households were randomly selected from each SEA. The household 
coverage rate was of 97 percent.

2. CONTEXT 

2.1. The Economy 

Despite unfavourable global economic conditions in 2012, Zambia’s economy was on a rebound 
with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth estimated at 7percent from 6.6percent in 2011. 
This  has  been  attributed  to  increased  trade  and  investment  inflow  between  most  Sub  Sahara 
African  countries  and  emerging  economies  and  relative  insulation  of  the  region  from  external 
financial  shocks.  During  the  year,  Government  undertook  appropriate  monitory  policy 
implementation  which  resulted  in  maintaining  relatively  low  inflation  rate  and  money  supply 
growth; however interest rates remained surprisingly high standing at 16percent as at December 
2012.  Government  also  took  bold  policy  decisions  and  made  it  mandatory  for  all  domestic 
transactions  to  be  effected  in  Kwacha.  The  country  also  rebased  the  currency  with  effect  from 
January 2013.    
 
In the medium term, Government intends to ensure continued strong economic performance with 
growth benefits being more equitably shared partly through focusing on four main sectors with 
high  employment  creation  potential  (agriculture,  tourism,  manufacturing  and  infrastructure 
development). Among the priority areas in the 2013 budget allocation are health, education and 
skills  training,  agriculture,  local  government  and  high  potential  employment  sectors  (tourism, 
manufacturing, and infrastructure). 
 

2.2. Rainfall Performance 

As  earlier  stated,  the  first  part  of  2012/13  rainfall  season  (October  to  December  2012)  was 
characterized  by  late  start  with  southern  half  of  the  country  experiencing  much  of  dry  spells; 
however there was a general increase in rainfall over most parts of the country by mid December 
2012.  This  situation  of  increased  rainfall  continued  into  the  second  half  of  the  rainfall  season 
(January to March 2013) despite experiencing intermediate dry spells. Further there are parts of 
the country that experienced above normal rainfall that resulted into flash floods with provinces 
such  as  Central  (Chibombo  and  Mumbwa),  Mafinga  (Isoka  and  Mafinga)  and  North  Western 
(Zambezi) having reported the localized flooding. 

 

2.3. Agriculture and Food Security 

The importance of agricultural development in poverty reduction is well acknowledged. In order 
to exploit the  full developmental potential of agriculture, crop and  livestock production will  be 
boosted while  maintaining  linkages to other sectors of the economy.  As part of the Agriculture 
reforms, Government has announced  its  intention to expand the Farmer Input Support Program 
to include soya, sunflower, cotton and rice; mainstream the electronic voucher system; increase

investment  in  extension  services,  irrigation,  training  and  research;  invest  in  roads,  power  and 
storage  in  a  bid  to  improve  market  access;  restock  livestock;  scale  up  animal  disease  research 
and  development  while  encouraging  local  value  addition.  Part  of  the  resources  for  these 
programs  will  be  generated  from  restricting  operations  of  the  FRA  to  managing  strategic 
reserves. These strategies together with improved forest management are expected to generate an 
estimated 550,000 new jobs over a five year period. 

 
2.3.1. Input Support to Farmers 
 
Government  through  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Livestock  (FISP),  the  Ministry  of 
Community  Development  Mother  and  Child  Health  (FSP)  and  FAO  (FISRI)  continued 
supporting  small  scale  farmers  with  inputs  in  the  last  production  season.  This  is  aimed  at 
increasing  small  scale  farmer  access  to  inputs  for  improved  productivity  and  enhanced  food 
security.    
 
2.3.2. Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP) 
Similar  to  the  previous  season,  a  total  of  900,000  farmers  were  targeted  with  183,000MT  of 
fertilizer

Although delivery of inputs to the provinces generally started timely, the actual accessing of the 
fertilizer  by  farmers  varied  and  was  much  delayed  in  many  districts.  A  number  of  districts  in 
southern Zambia received their fertilizer late (in the middle of the growing season when the rains 
were already erratic. In an effort to improve efficiency in input delivery to farmers Government 
has announced some reforms for the 2013/14 production season which will include the use of e- 
voucher system for about 40percent of the target farmers.     
 

 

 2.3.3. Farmer Input Support Response Initiative (FISRI) for Conservation Agriculture 

This  initiative  is  meant  to  complement the  FISP,  and  has  been  funded  by  the  European  Union 
with technical support from the FAO from 2009 – 2012. The progamme is aimed at scaling up of 
conservation agriculture with a target of 600, 000 small scale farmers by 2015 to enhance crop 
productivity  and  profitability  of  farming  enterprises  while  exploiting  the  Natural  resource  base

sustainably.  By  last  season,  support  (fertilizer,  seed,  Chaka  hoe  and  herbicides)  had  been 
rendered to 19,778 Lead Farmers in 31 districts and the programme has been mainstreamed into 
the MAL programmes. 
 
2.3.4. Food Security Pack (FSP) and Extended Food Security Pack (EFSP) 
 
The  FSP  and  EFSP  being  implemented  by  the  MCDMCH  are  part  of  larger  social  safety  net 
programmes  targeting  vulnerable  rural  households  and  are  meant  to  promote  improved  food 
security. The details are given in the social safety net section. 
 
2.3.5. Crop Production, Food Supply and Access 

Similar  to  past  years,  maize  and  cassava  production  volumes  in  2012/13  production  season 
remained by far the highest in comparison to other crops based on the MAL data. As expected, 
among the major production areas, the Southern Province recorded the largest maize production 
drop (21percent) mainly due to the late start of season and erratic rainfall

The  largest declines (>40percent) were recorded in Itezhi-tezhi,  Mazabuka and Siavonga while 
major  district  producers,  Namwala  and  Choma  had  moderate  production  drop  of  less  than 
30percent. All other districts of Southern Province had either very low drops or slight increases 
with respect to the previous season. Production decline in Eastern and Central provinces on the 
other  hand  were  insignificant  at  no  more  than  3percent  as  increase  in  area  made  up  for  yield 
reduction.  For the  northern  region  which  received  adequate  rainfall,  maize  production  declines 
recorded in Northern (22percent) and Luapula Province (27percent) can be mostly attributed to 
reduction  in  area  planted  similar  to  the  Copperbelt  province.  For  North-western,  the  maize 
production reduction of 15percent can only be partially explained by the slight reduction in area 
as  Kabompo  and  Kasempa  production  significantly  declined  (35percent)  while  for  western 
province  overall  maize  production  actually  slightly  increased  despite  some  districts  having 
experienced erratic rainfall. Areas of concern in Western Province include Mongu and Sesheke 

 

7

 

where  maize  production  declined  by  more  than  40percent.  However,  the  major  provincial 
supplier (Kaoma) registered a large increase of 42percent in maize output.  

 Despite notable area increases in rice and groundnuts, crop yields were adversely affected by the 
erratic  rainfall  reducing  output  (Figure  2).  Soybeans  were  the  exception,  and  a  45percent 
increase  in  the  area  planted  contributed to  a  28percent  increase  in  production.  The    significant 
reduction in cotton production, triggered by poor prices last season, allowed farmers to increase 
area planted under soybeans significantly and area planted under maize to a lesser extent (only 3 
percent more) when compared to the previous season.  

 

2.3.6. National Agricultural Production 

According to the 2013/2014 National  Food Balance Sheet, the production of cereals  in  Zambia 
has declined by 13 percent which can mainly be attributed to the delayed start of the season  and 
dry  spells  experienced  between  January  and  February  2013.  The  production  of  cereals  such  as 
maize  and  rice  declined  while  production  of  wheat,  which  is  mainly  produced  by  commercial 
farmers under irrigation, is expected to improve slightly (see the Balance sheet below).

The  total  national  maize  production  was  estimated  at  2,532,800  MT,  which  is  6  percent  above 
the  five  year  average  and  11  percent  below  the  previous  season.  With  the  carryover  stock  of 
455,221  MT,  the  total  national  supply  has  been  estimated  at  2,988,021MT  while  the  national 
maize  requirement  stands  at  2,534,026  MT  leaving  a  surplus  of  453,995  MT  for  commercial 
export. Paddy rice production estimated at 44,747MT is 27 percent below the five year average, 
but  closely  comparable  to  the  previous  season’s  production  level  which  stood  at  44,747MT. 
National  wheat  production  which  has  substantially  increased  in  the  past  six  years  has  been 
estimated at 273,584 MT for the August/September 2013 harvest, signifying an 8percent increase 
over last season. After taking into account the carry overstock, the national supply estimated at 
441,839 MT will exceed the national requirement by 146,839 MT and this will be available for 
export.  

 

2.3.7. Food Access 

Following  four  successive  years  of  surplus  production,  the  food  security  situation  during  the 
2012/13 marketing and consumption season had largely been stable. The FRA having purchased 
slightly over 1 million MT of maize from small scale farmers were holding most of the surplus 
maize  stocks  in  the  country.  While  the  maize  sales  by  the  Agency  to  millers  and  needy 
communities  at  fixed  prices  (KR  60  /50Kg)  kept  the  markets  well  supplied  with  staple  food, 
intermittent maize meal shortages were reported in the Copperbelt and some towns bordering the 
DRC and Tanzania as demand for Zambian maize and meal substantially increased. This resulted 
in above average prices for maize meal in some districts threatening the food security situation as 
poorer households’ purchasing power was being eroded. By September, the Government of the 
Republic  of  Zambia  (GRZ)  put  in  place  restricted  exports  in  a  bid  to  curb  large  staple  food 
outflow  from  the  country  which  was  pushing  meal  prices  to  abnormally  high  levels  in  some 
districts. By February, Government requested the millers to reduce maize meal prices in line with 
the  fixed  priced  maize  they  were  accessing  from  FRA  up  until  the  month  of  May.  By  March 
Government instituted further stringent measures (police patrols) at the DRC borders which have 
resulted  in  significantly  reduced  informal  maize  and  meal  outflow  and  steep  increases 
(85percent) in maize prices along the DRC border.  
 
The Government has announced its intention to purchase 500,000 MT of maize for strategic food 
reserve at a fixed price of KR 65 per 50Kg from small scale farmers through the Food Reserve 
Agency  (FRA)  purchasing  program  from  June  10th  to  September  30th.  This  price  has  been 
maintained for the past four years and is no longer based on prevailing market conditions. In the 
month of May, small traders in Lusaka were purchasing maize from farmers at KR 55 per 50Kg 
being  supplied  mostly  from  southern  and  central  province.  By  early  June,  most  small  scale 
farmers were  hoarding  maize  in anticipation of  sales to the FRA at KR 65 per 50 Kg which  is 
above what the market is currently offering. Maize and meal prices are expected to increase early 
as the effect of the recent fuel price increase is fully felt and as pressure from regional demand 
increases.  
 
Staple  food  prices  are  currently  stable  in  some  areas  and  declining  in  other  areas  as  the  new 
harvest starts entering the market making the staple food more accessible to poorer households. 
Poorer households in southern Zambia which was most affected by erratic rainfall are currently 

 

9

 

meeting their food needs with their reduced harvest while also working for food. Domestic maize 
and maize meal supply levels will be sustained by stringent export permit regulations which will 
limit  formal  maize  exports.  Consequently,  the  country  will  have  adequate  staple  food  to  meet 
market  demand  and  any  arising  relief  needs  for  the  duration  of  the  current  marketing  season 
despite anticipated increased informal maize exports to the DRC. 
 
2.3.8. Livestock Situation 

The  production  of  cattle,  goats  and  pigs  continues  to  be  a  major  livelihood  among  small  scale 
farmers  in  many  parts  of  the  country  particularly  Western,  Southern,  Central  Provinces.  These 
areas are also prone to drought and occasionally floods which impact on livestock condition. In 
flood years, high incidences of FMD, blackleg, lumpy skin and heart water occur, while during 
droughts,  livestock  productivity  is  reduced  as  grazing  and  foraging  areas  become  restricted  to 
wetlands  and  valleys.  With  recurring  disease  burden,  livestock  movement  bans  have  been 
maintained for several years now which often disrupt the cattle trade, and reduces income. This 
often  exacerbates  farmers’  vulnerability  to  the  effects  of  drought/floods  especially  in  Southern 
province by taking away the means to cultivate their land (draught power) as well as one of the 
most  reliable  income  sources  (Tembo,  et.al.,2006).  In  the  major  livestock  keeping  areas, 
livestock acts as some form of insurance against poor weather and subsequent crop failure while 
also  providing  the  farmers  with  income  during  difficult  times.  Asset  erosion  is  experienced, 
when  livestock  disease  burden  is  not  seriously  addressed  because  of  the  high  value  of  these 
animals. 

2.3.9. Fisheries  

According to Department of Fisheries statistics, the Sector has a potential to produce of 120 000 
MT  (aquaculture  and  capture  fisheries)  fish  stock  per  annum  earning  the  country  an  estimated 
US $ 4,000,000 annually. However in view of the problem of over fishing resulting in depletion 
of fish stock, this is currently unattainable. The fisheries sector in Zambia has not only been over 
exploited but has not contributed significantly to revenue generation.  Although the performance 
of  capture  fisheries  has  been  far  below 
expectation its contribution to the growth of 
the sector cannot be ignored as it contributes 
80percent  of  the  fisheries  sector  production 
(Figure 3).  

Figure 3: Fish production trend in MT 

Fish  production  is  enhanced  during  flood 
years  (promotes  breeding),  but  negatively 
affected  during  drought  years  impacting  on 
income  of 
fishing  communities.  The 
northern  waters  (Tanganyika,  Bangweulu, 
Mweru  –  Luapula)  and  Kariba  Dam  have 
the largest fish stock contributing 70percent 
of 
in 
Zambia. Of concern is the low and reducing 
fish  stock  in  Kafue,  Lusiwanshi  (Serenje) 
and  Zambezi  River  where  fish  stock  has 
declined  by  41percent,  31percent  and  48 

the  estimated  fresh  water  stock 

 

10

 

percent respectively in the last five years. 

 

2.4. Social Protection 
 
The sector aims to protect and promote the livelihoods and welfare of the critically poor people 
with the greatest vulnerability to adverse impact of risks and shocks so that they have sufficient 
livelihood  security  to  meet  their  basic  needs.  Among  other  things,  vulnerability  can  be 
characterized as lacking human capital, or lacking productive capital. Social protection activities 
often address the lack of productive capital by targeting people who lack human capital as well 
as  productive  assets.  Since  most  households  that  have  deficits  in  human  capital  are  often 
marginalized from development opportunities, social protection therefore provides for deficits in 
basic needs, and build appropriate and sustainable coping strategies and livelihood mechanisms.  
Social protection activities may seek to assist such households to cope at a ‘crisis point’, or may 
alternatively intervene strategically to prevent or mitigate the impacts of risk, shock and shifting 
vulnerabilities.  In  addition,  related  cause  and  effects  to  vulnerability  include;  gender  based 
violence, human trafficking and forced labour which has risen in the recent past. 
 
In view of the above, social protection programmes are targeted to reach priority groups exposed 
to  key  risks,  shocks  and  shifting  vulnerabilities.  Whether  aimed  at  promotion  or  prevention, 
social  protection  is  always  specifically  targeted  at  key  vulnerable  groups,  forming  part  of  the 
poverty reduction process, and complementing broad based National programmes. 
 

In 2012 the sector recorded positive progress as a number of empowerment programmes such as 
the  Social  Cash  Transfer  and  Food  Security  Pack  targeting  low  capacity  and  incapacitated 
households were implemented. The following are some existing Social Protection Interventions 
being implemented in Zambia by the Government: 

 
2.4.1. The Food Security Pack (FSP) 
 This programme is being implemented in all the districts in the country. Each farmer receives a 
package of inputs sufficient to cultivate 0.5 ha of maize, 0.25 ha of legumes and in some cases 
chickens  and goats as well.  Farmers are required to pay  back about 10 percent of their cost of 
inputs in kind out of their harvest 
 
The  programme  makes  farmers  self-sustaining  by:  (i)  helping  diversification  of  crops;  (ii) 
building  grain  storage  capacity  and  seed  banks;(iii)  promoting  conservation  farming  practices; 
and(iv) supporting alternative livelihoods (poultry, fishing, bee-keeping etc). Beneficiaries under 
FSP  are  maintained  for  two  seasons  until  when  they  graduate  to  self-sustaining  levels  of 
increased  food  production,  and  more  commercial  use  of  inputs.  The  programme  has  however, 

 

11

 

suffered  consistently  a  number  of  challenges  such  as  weak  links  between  beneficiaries  and 
extension  system;  delayed  delivery  of  inputs  due  to  budget  uncertainty  and  administrative 
capacity constraints among others. 
 
 
2.4.2. Extended Food Security Pack (EFSP) 
Recognizing  the  challenges  encountered  with  the  Food  Security  Pack  programme  being 
implemented  nationwide,  the  Ministry  of  Community  Development  Mother  and  Child  Health 
with support from the Norwegian Embassy commenced the piloting of a revised model called the 
“Expanded  Food  Security  Pack  (EFSP)”.  This  model  involves;  (i)  Strengthened  targeting  to 
enhance the numbers of participating farmers ;  (ii) Adopting a model of ‘lead farmers’ and more 
private  extension  support;  (iii)  A  larger  input  pack  (consisting  of  enough  fertilizer  and  seed  to 
cover 0.5 ha); (iv) Providing a social cash transfer of KR100-150 to all beneficiaries during the 
lean  season.  (v)  Use  of  e-vouchers  in  place  of  physical  distribution  of  packs;  and  (vi) 
Introduction of a Stronger monitoring and evaluation system. The new pilot programme is being 
implemented  in  Chadiza,  Itezhi-tezhi  and  Nyimba  districts  targeting  3,000  beneficiaries  per 
district  annually  and  will  be  rolled  out to twelve  (12)  districts  in  the  next  five  years;  reaching 
between 45,000 to 90,000 farmers in areas with high poverty and Food insecurity.  
 
 
2.4.3. Public Welfare Assistance Scheme (PWAS) 

The  Public  Welfare  Assistance  Scheme  is  government’s  major  social  assistance  programme 
aimed at assisting the  incapacitated households  in order to reduce hunger, extreme poverty and 
destitution.  Under  PWAS,  beneficiaries  are  assisted  with  education,  health  and  social  support. 
The PWAS programme uses a community based approach when targeting and implementing the 
scheme. The programme is being implemented in all the districts of Zambia. The programme has 
assisted 86,114 incapacitated households to meet their basic needs. Of this total, forty six percent 
(46percent)  are  males  with  the  remainder  being  females.  Disabled  beneficiaries  constituted ten 
percent (10percent) of the total PWAS beneficiaries (8467 of which 4063 were males and 4404 
females).  

 
2.4.4. Social Cash Transfers (SCT): 
 The Social Cash Transfers are regular non-contributory payments and/or money provided to the 
incapacitated  and  extremely  poor  individuals  or  households  in  a  given  community.  The 
beneficiaries use the cash to access food and other basic services as well as making savings and 
small  investments.  Additionally,  the  SCT  scheme  has  a  multiplier  effect  on  the  community  as 
there is direct investment in the local economies as the beneficiaries spend the money procuring 
goods from the local environment there by promoting local entrepreneurship. Results under this 
scheme show that individuals and households accessing SCTs have seen notable improvements 
in their livelihoods, increased consumption diverse and adequate foods, investment in education, 

 

12

 

health as well as reduced destitution. The SCT covers 11 districts reaching 51,106 beneficiaries 
of the targeted 38,500.  However, the plan is to extend coverage to all the districts in Zambia.  In 
terms of beneficiaries by gender, female (82 percent) beneficiaries were more than the males (18 
percent). Of the total caseload 2,125 were households with members who were living with severe 
disabilities. 
 
2.4.5. Child Protection 
This intervention is aimed at addressing the plight of children including those found on the street 
by  providing  adequate  legal  and  social  protection  such  as  shelter,  education,  food  to  children 
living  in  difficult  circumstances  and/or  in  need  of  care.    Further,  Government  commenced  the 
construction of state owned and state-run children homes. In terms of implementation there is an 
urgent  need  for  coordination  and  collaboration  among  all  stakeholders  involved  in  child 
protection programmes for effective rehabilitation and reintegration of children in need of care. 
This programme is being implemented in all the districts of Zambia. 
 

2.4.6. Women Empowerment Programme (WEP)  
Under  this  intervention  the  sector  undertook  a  number  of  activities  through  MCDMCH,  which 
included  the  provision  of  grants,  distribution  of  income  generating  equipment  such  as  sewing 
machines, yenga press, peanut butter processing machines etc. to marginalized women groups to 
all Districts in the country. The programme managed to reach 2600 beneficiaries of the targeted 
3000 in 2012. 
 
2.4.7. School Feeding Programme 

This  programme  aims  to  promote  school  attendance  and  attentiveness  among  vulnerable 
children.  This  intervention  supports  802,000  school  going  children  in  twenty  two  (22)  districts 
identified  by  Ministry  of  Education,  Science  Vocational  Training  and  Early  Education  and 
MCDMCH with technical support from the World Food Programme. Some of the key indicators 
used  to  identify  priority  operational  areas  include;  (i)  drop-out rates  ;(ii)  Net  enrollment  ratios 
and ;(iii) extreme poverty levels. The program has continued to face a number of challenges such 
as delays in transporting and storing the food commodities. 

2.4.8. Peri-Urban Community Self-Help (PUSH):  

This  is  a  public  works  based  scheme  that  provides  employment  to  the  poor  in  both  rural  and 
urban areas. Introduced originally in response to drought and floods in 1991, it has since evolved 
into  a  combination  of  an  income  generating,  employment  and  training  programmes  geared  to 
raise  the  incomes  of  the  poorest.  Targeting  of  districts  varies  and  depends  on  the  levels  of 
vulnerability in the areas concerned with about 60percent of beneficiaries being women.

2.5. Water and Sanitation 
The country’s vision on water and sanitation is to ensure that all Zambians have access to clean 
water and sanitation and utilize them in an efficient and sustainable manner for wealth creation 
and  improved  livelihood  by  2030.  The  Sixth  National  development  Plan  (SNDP  has  outlined 
performance indicators for the water supply and sanitation sector.  

These  targets  have  taken  into  consideration  the  growing  population  and  subsequent  growth  in 
domestic  water  demand.  By  2015,  projected  per  capita  consumption  of  water  will  be  7,430 
m3/person/year. It is also clear that despite these targets, there are other factors caused by climate 
change impacts that may result into dry spells that could lead to reduction in water availability or 
floods  which  could  lead  to  deposition  of  faecal  matter  which  ultimately  may  compromise  the 
quality of water consumed, as was the case during the 2012/13 rainfall season. Further it is clear 
that the main water sources used in the rural areas is surface and ground water which makes the 
situation  even  more  vulnerable  depending  on  the  type  and  condition.  To  alleviate  these 
challenges  the  government  has  through  the  WRMD  sub  –  sector  set  performance  targets  to 
achieve  sustainable  water  resources  development  by  constructing  and/or  rehabilitating  water 
infrastructure1. 

For the Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) sub sector, similar plans have been put in place to 
improve  the  proportion  of  rural  and  urban  population  having  access  to  water  and  sanitation 
facilities. This will be implemented under the National Rural Water Supply and National Urban 
and Peri–urban Water Supply and Sanitation programmes. 

In  order  to  achieve  the  set  targets  both  in  the  WRDM  and  WSS,  the  government  through  the 
SNDP  has  projected  investment  in  Water  and  Sanitation  Infrastructure  development  for  the 
period 2011 to 2015 as shown in the table below:

and promoting adequate sanitation and good hygiene practices in an effort to improve the health 
situation and alleviate poverty in Zambia’s rural areas. 

The  Sanitation  and  Hygiene  Component of  the  NRWSSP  has  three  distinct  “sub-components”, 
namely Dissemination and Advocacy, Household Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion; and School 
Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion.  
 

2.6. Education 
The  Government  has  prioritized  education  as  one  of  the  key  drivers  for  national  development. 
This emanates from the fact that the sector provides opportunities for human capital development 
and enhanced productivity thereby resulting in increased wealth creation and a healthier nation. 
 
In  order  to  realize  the  vision  of  an  enlightened  country,  Government  is  a  signatory  to  various 
progressive international protocols such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the 
Education for All (EFA) goals which seek to improve education based on the principle that it is a 
fundamental  human  right.   The  key  policy  documents  being  utilized  for the  implementation  of 
education  programmes  include  the  Education  the  future  programme  which  has  been  in  effect 
since  1996,  the  National  Implementation  Framework III (2011  –  2015)  and  the  Sixth  National 
Development Programme (2011 – 2015). 
 
In the quest to realize the education goals of the National Implementation Framework III and the 
SNDP, four major principles capture the underlining objectives of the Education For All goals in 
Zambia and these shall continue to be used as the primary point of reference in all interventions 
in the educational sector. The major principles include the following: 

i.  Access: which determines the commitment to provide opportunities for citizens to access 
and  participate  in  the  education  service  delivery.  One  of  the  important  components  of 
access drivers  includes the expansion of  infrastructure through the annual  infrastructure 
development plans. The  infrastructure expansion  which started in the BESSIP period as 
an intervention to broaden access to education has continued to be the focus to increase 
enrolments  even  in  the  NIF  II  and  FNDP  periods.  From  2008  to  2010  the  Ministry 
embarked  on  the  construction  of  about  1,500  classrooms  annually  at  primary  education 
and  out  of  the  targeted  100  secondary  schools  by  2015,  construction  of  about  69 
commenced and some have since completed and opened. The infrastructure development 
has seen enrolment rising from 3,527,042 in 2008 to 3,730,530 in 2011. At tertiary level, 
the  ministry  commenced  the  upgrading  of  Colleges  into  Universities.  This  process  has 
seen  the  expansion  of  infrastructure  at  the  institutions.  Government’s  intention  is  to 
establish a university in each of the ten provinces.     
 

ii.  Equity:  Government  policy  is  to  ensure  that  the  distribution  and  utilization  of 
opportunities in education are fairly targeted in order to reach the disadvantaged groups 

 

15

 

 

in society. This target calls for specific measures and explicit strategies in to enable such 
groups  to  fully  participate  in  the  education  process.  Women  and  girls,  disadvantaged 
children, particularly orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), displaced children and the 
children  with  special  educational  needs  (CSEN)  are  specifically  targeted  to  give  them 
opportunities  to  access  education.  In  this  regard,  policy  interventions  such  as  free 
education,  bursary  scheme,  School  Health  and  Nutrition  programme  and  the  re-entry 
policy are intended for this category of children. 

iii.  Quality: the quality of education is meant to translate into improved learning outcomes 
of the learners.  Despite the increased investments in the sector, these have not impacted 
on learner performance as evidenced by the poor examinations results at all levels where 
results  have  not  exceeded  40percent  average.  In  order  to  address  this  concern,  the 
Ministry  is  considering  some  of  the  factors  that are  related  to  poor  performance  which 
include  teacher  recruitment  targeting  5000  teachers  annually  to  improve  pupil-teacher 
ratio,  continuous  professional  development  of  teachers,  teacher  incentives,  procurement 
of teaching and learning materials, curriculum review among others.  

iv.  Efficiency  and  effectiveness:  this  calls  for  the  transparency  and  accountability  of  the 
system  in  the  optimal  utilization  of  resources.  It  requires  prudent  management  of 
administrative and systemic  structures to yield desired results and reduce on wastage of 
material  and  human  resources.  The  focus  in  this  regard  to  ensure  continuous  staff 
capacity  development  as  well  as  appraisal  in  all  aspects  so  as  to  make  the  system 
responsive and relevant to the needs of the country.  
 

One  of  the  critical  issues  the  Ministry  needs  to  start  addressing  through  a  broader  and  holistic 
approach is the issue of education in emergencies. Yearly, the country experiences some natural 
disasters  that  have  a  very  negative  impact  on  the  education  system.  These  disasters  include 
perennial  floods,  droughts,  dry  spells  and  epidemics.  Floods  cause  destruction  to  school 
infrastructure,  affect  community  livelihood  forcing  the  learners  and  the  schools  to  abandon 
education  activities  (western/southern  provinces  etc.).  Droughts  affect  the  livelihood  of  the 
communities as their food security is compromised forcing children to abandon school in search 
of  food  for  example  Southern  province.  Those  that  manage  to  attend  school  are  too  hungry  to 
concentrate  and  therefore  little  learning  takes  place.  The  disease  outbreaks  also  impact 
negatively  on  the  sector  as  they  end  in  closure  of  schools,  deaths  or  children  are  too  sick  to 
concentrate on learning (Mupambe case in Mufulira).  
 
In  trying  to  mitigate  such  emergencies,  the  Ministry  through  the  School  Health  and  Nutrition 
programme  and  in  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Health  has  been  implementing 
interventions  such  as  de-worming  of  children  in  bilharzia  prone  areas;  provide  micronutrients 
and above all the school feeding programme which is being scaled up through the Home Grown 
School Feeding Plan (HGSFP). The Plan aims to facilitate the transformation of existing School 

 

16

 

Feeding  Programme  into  a  locally  driven  and  more  sustainable  programme.  The  Ministry  in 
collaboration with DMMU and UNICEF assists in infrastructure rehabilitation and resettling of 
displaced communities in order to restore the livelihood of the families. It is, however, important 
to  note  that the  institutionalization  of  the  ‘education  in  emergencies’  will  serve  to  provide  the 
Ministry of Education, Science, Technology and Vocational Training staff at all levels with basic 
skills in ‘emergency preparedness’ and more importantly as part of the school curriculum. 
 
2.7. Human Habitation and Shelter  
 
The Government of the Republic of Zambia aspires to provide adequate shelter to all its citizens 
as shelter  is a  basic  social  need and  is a pre requisite  for national development. Unfortunately, 
the country has  been  facing a critical shortage of shelter since  independence and  has with time 
suffered a lopsided development in the sector with the rural districts seriously lagging behind.  
 
According to data collected by the Local Government Authority, housing stocks as of 2001 stood 
at  2,  311,  988.  Further,  the  Living  Conditions  Monitoring  Survey  of  2010  indicates  that  66 
percent  of  households  in  Zambia  still  occupy  the  traditional  mud  and  pole  huts  which  fail  to 
withstand the vagaries of weather.  
 
Owing  to  this,  with  the  onset  of  rains  Government  responds  to  Internally  Displaced  Persons’ 
(IDPs)  needs  every  year.  The  Government  has  an  obligation  to  protect  the  displaced  persons 
affected by human induced or natural hazards by providing shelter each time a shock that leads 
to  displacement  of  people  occurs.  It  has  also  an  obligation  to  relocate  or  resettle  people  from 
flood  prone  areas  to  higher  and  safer  lands  to  avoid  the  repeated  experience  of  the  same 
communities being affected each time a shock occurs. Data indicates that over 1,000 households 
have been displaced and resettled in various places in the last five years (Disaster Management 
and  Mitigation  Unit,  2011).  The  causes  of  these  displacements  were  due  to  natural  disasters 
(especially  climate  change  induced  hazards),  encroachments,  development  projects  and 
differences in social or religious affiliations.  
 
In order to address the issue of displacements, the Government has come up with a Draft Policy 
to  address  resettlement  and  compensation  of  the  displaced  people.  It  has  also  developed 
guidelines  to  operationalise  the  Policy.  The  key  objective  of  the  policy  is  to  provide  adequate 
shelter  and  resettlement  assistance  to  the  displaced  people  during  and  after  the  disaster.  The 
Policy  also  seeks  the  protection  of  the  right  to  shelter  for  the  IDPs  by  tasking  Government  to 
provide temporal shelter to such people displaced by natural disasters and  ensure that permanent 
and  mutually  agreed  upon  dwellings  following  national  standards  is  provided  in  line  with 
international protocols and conventions.

2.8. Infrastructure 
The Six National Development Plan places infrastructure development as one of the key sectors 
apart  from  Agriculture  that  would  drive  the  Zambian  Economy  to  meet  the  vision  2030. 
Development  of  infrastructure  is  also  one  of  the  key  poverty  reduction  mechanisms  that  the 
government  has  put  in  place  to  contribute  towards  improving  the  living  conditions  of  the  poor 
and vulnerable communities. Most of Zambia’s major road infrastructure was constructed in the 
1970s. The age of the drainage facilities (culverts & bridges) coupled with vandalism (mostly on 
corrugated metal  ARMCO pipes) effects  have resulted  in considerable damage  from  inclement 
weather. The condition of roads, bridges and culverts have  become generally  bad. The country 
has  for  the  past  three  consecutive  seasons  experienced  floods  which  have  had  an  impact  on 
infrastructure.  

 

The country depends  mainly on gravel  and  feeder roads connecting districts and wards to each 
other  especially  in  rural  areas.  This  is  a  vital  and  strategic  link  for  the  supply  of  goods  and 
services  to  the  communities  in  various  parts  of  the  country.  Government  has  encouraged  the 
establishment of  schools and  health centers  in the rural  areas through  community development 
programmes such as rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. According to the LCMS (2004), the 
most widespread infrastructure projects in the rural areas are rehabilitation/resurfacing of roads, 
provision and improvement of education infrastructure and health facilities. However despite all 
this, most of the infrastructure especially in the educational sector remains in a poor state as most 
community schools are built from pole and mud.

range between 35-59 years. Of the household heads that are aged between 30-49 years, 77percent 
reside in the rural strata of the assessed districts compared to 23percent from urban.  
 
Further, for those household heads aged between 45-59 years, 82percent reside in the rural strata 
compared to 18percent from the urban. The  assessment has  further shown that the average age 
for  the  household  head  is  forty  four  (44)  years.  The  analysis  of  the  results  by  locality 
(Rural/Urban)  have  shown  that  80percent  of  the  female  headed  households  reside  in  the  rural 
strata of the assessed districts compared to 78percent of the male headed households that equally 
reside  in  the  rural  strata  (See  figure  6).  Inversely,  there  are  more  male  headed  households 
(22percent) that reside in the urban strata of the assessed districts compared to 20percent of the 
female  headed  households.  Further  the  average  age  for  the  household  heads  by  locality,  has 
shown that those residing  in rural strata of the assessed districts  is  forty  four (44) compared to 
forty  three  (43)  from  the  urban  strata.  The  assessment  has  also  shown  that  majority  of  the

3.2. General Livelihood 

3.2.1  Income Sources 

Livelihoods  are defined as  comprising 
the  capabilities,  assets  and  activities 
required  for  a  means  of  living.  In  this 
definition, the five forms of livelihood 
assets  are  given  as  natural,  social-political,  human,  physical  and  financial  capital3.  The  2013 
impact assessment has  shown that the  major  income sources  for  most of the  households  in the 
assessed  districts  is  subsistence  farming  (28percent),  casual  labour  (12percent),  formal 
employment (9percent), small businesses 9percent) and gardening (7percent). Of the households 
that depend on subsistence farming as their main income source, thirty four percent (34percent) 
reside  in  the  urban  strata  of  the  assessed  districts  compared  to  thirty  two  percent  (32percent) 
from  the  rural  strata.  Further  the  assessment  results  have  shown  that  of  those  households  that 
depend  on  formal  employment  as  their  main  source  of  income,  eleven  percent  (11percent) 
resides  in  the  rural  strata  compared  to  eight  percent  (8percent)  from  the  urban  strata.  It  was 
revealed  that  of  the  household  that  depend  on  gardening  as  their  main  income  source,  five 
percent (5percent) reside in urban and rural areas of the assessed districts.

3.3. Household Expenditure Patterns 

 

The Assessment revealed that 34percent of household expenditure in the surveyed districts was 
on food. The other major expenditure items related to energy which accounted for 13 percent of 
the total expenditure while transport and clothing requirements each accounted for 9 percent (See 
figure 11 below). The expenditure on rent was very low as most of them reside in own houses. 
The section therefore discusses household expenditure on food, transport, energy, education and 
health.  

 

23

 

 

24

 

households have a strong productive asset base compared to female headed ones, which enables 
them to engage in more productive activities and hence end up having more disposable income.  

 

The  survey  also  revealed  that  household  size  had  an  influence  expenditure  on  food.  About  40 
percent of the households with a family size of two spend less than KR 100 on food.  

 

3.3.2. Expenditure on Transport 

The next highest expenditure items that households spend their incomes on included purchase of 
energy  and  transport  services  which  stood  at  9  percent.  Majority  of  the  households  spent  less 
than KR 250 on transport every month on transport. A further 9 percent spent between KR 250 
and KR 500 on transport (See figure 14 below).

3.3.4. Expenditure on Health and Education  

In terms of the total expenditure share on education, the survey has revealed that 56 percent of 
the households from the surveyed districts spent less than KR 150 on education. The survey also 
revealed  that  the  modal  expenditure  on  education  was  KR  200.  There  are  differences  in 
household expenditure on education between urban and rural settings. In this regard, the survey 
has  revealed  that  52  percent  of  the  households  from  the  rural  strata  of  the  surveyed  districts 
spend less than KR 150 on education as compared to 24 percent from the urban strata.  

 

Expenditure on health services was very low with the modal expenditure being only KR 10. The 
average expenditure for houses in the surveyed districts was KR 74. This is so because most of 
the Government facilities where most people get treated do not charge for the services rendered. 

 

3.4 Early Warning and Preparedness Measures 
 
According  to  the  assessment,  24  percent  of  the  households  in  the  assessed  districts  indicated 
having been warned about the impending floods and dry spells during the 2012/13 season. This 
indicates  a  large  figure  of  people  that  still  do  not  receive  early  warning  information  (EWI). 
Further,  the  assessment  has  revealed  that,  of  the  24  percent  that  indicated  receipt  of  EWI,  67 
percent  said  they  obtained  such  information  through  the  radios  while  a  further  18  percent 
indicated  the  television  as  the  source  of  such  information.  Luangwa  district  had  the  highest 
number of households (15 percent) who indicated having received the information through radio 
followed by Choma (13 percent), Chongwe (11 percent) and Mulobezi (11 percent). The rest of 
the districts (Sikongo, Zimba, Senanga, Nalolo, Nyimba and Mumbwa) had less than 8 percent 
of  the  households  who  received  the  early  warning  information  through  the  radio.  There  were 
very  few  households  (about  1  percent)  in  the  assessed  district  who  received  early  warning 
information through newspapers, flyers, personal visits and community meetings. 

 

 

26

 

When asked about the source of such EWI,  majority of respondents (67 percent) indicated that 
such  information  normally  came  from  the  Zambia  Meteorological  Department  followed  by  the 
local  DDMCs  (52  percent).  Very  few  communities  (Less  that  1  percent)  indicated  having 
received  EWI  from  other  sources  such  as  ZESCO,  Department  of  Water  Affairs,  ZANIS  and 
neighbors.  

 

Utilization of the early warning information still remains low with the survey revealing that only 
9.3  percent  of  the  households  in  the  surveyed  districts  took  preventive  and  preparedness 
measures. These measures included planting early for those that were expecting to face some dry 
spells (4 percent), improving storage facilities (0.2 percent) and plating drought resistant crops (1 
percent).  A  further  3  percent  claimed  that  they  shared  such  information  with  people  in  their 
neighbourhood. 

When  asked  about  the  kind  of  information  that  would  help  them  to  adequately  prepare  for 
shocks, 32 percent of  households  in the assessed  districts  indicated that information relating to 
weather  would  be  most  ideal  while  29  percent  indicated  that  they  would  require  information 
related to disaster risk reduction. A further 6 percent of the households indicated that they would 
require information on sustainable agricultural methods. 

 

Analysis of information from the assessment indicated that education had a big role to play in the 
utilization of early warning information. Household heads that had at least primary education (48

season.  While  the  FISP  program  to  some 
extent increased input access for the target 
farmers (25 percent), the major source for 
acquisition  of 
inputs  were  market 
purchases  (40  percent).  However 
the 
quantities  purchased/acquired  were  far 
below  the  requirement  as  only  45  percent 
of  these  households  had  adequate  inputs 
for the main cereal crops. The inadequacy 
of  acquisition  of  inputs  by  the  majority 
(55  percent)  of  the  farmers  was  mostly 
attributed  to  low  purchasing  power  and 
inadequate  support  from  input  supply  (subsidized)  programs.  This  to  some  extent  shows  that 
supply of the  inputs on the  market was  not the  limiting  factor but rather the purchasing power 
and therefore shows the ability for the private sector to meet the current effective input demand. 
Acquisition  of  inputs  through  the  Food  Security  Pack  (FSP)  and  gifts  remains  insignificant. 
While  a  large  number  of  farmers  purchased  the  input  from  the  market,  the  percentage  using 
recycled seed (28 percent) is still a source of concern which could help explain the continued low 
yields being attained by small scale farmers especially for maize. For Legumes however, farmers 
reported  late  seed  availability  (particularly  soybeans)  on  the  market  as  a  limitation  aside  from 
erratic rainfall in the 2012/13 production season. 

 

3.5.2. Impact of Rainfall Performance on Crops and Livestock 

The survey results indicated that most of the forty-four (44) assessed districts experienced more 
of prolonged dry spells than floods/water-logging during the 2012/13 production season. While a 
few districts in Central, Eastern, Muchinga and Northwestern provinces may have experienced a 
combination  of 
in 
January/February for a short period and was highly localized.  

flooding/water-logging  was  experienced 

floods  and  dry  spells, 

 

Erratic  rainfall  impact  was  most  severe  on  crops  but  moderate  on  livestock  at  the  time  of  the 
assessment in April/May. The impact of adverse rainfall on crops was most severe in districts of 

 

28

 

Southern  Province.  This  is  reflected  in  the  resultant  yield  loss  and  crop  losses  in  major  areas 
adversely  impacted  by  rainfall.  In  those  districts,  production  drops  especially  for  maize  have 
been  significant  with  respect  to  the  previous  season.  There  was  low  to  no  effect  on  most 
households  on  stored  food,  market  access  and  fish  catches  despite  a  few  areas  reporting 
reduction in fish catches. While livestock impact was moderate at the time of the assessment, as 
the water points dry up and pasture becomes limited in view of the earlier than normal end to the 
rainy season (southern and western Zambia), the full impact on livestock condition will become 
more severe.  

 
3.5.3. Crop and Staple Food Production 
 
Most (84percent) of the households in the assessed districts were farming households with access 
to arable land. The majority of them (67 percent) had access to 1ha and more of land. Similar to 
the  2011/12  production  season,  50percent  of  the  farming  households  cultivated  at  least  1  ha 
during  the  2012/13  season.    Their  inability  to  expand  areas  planted  to  cereals  was  mostly 
attributed to erratic rainfall (34 percent), inadequate and  late acquisition of subsidized  fertilizer 
from Government (17 percent) while water-logging in some areas was also cited (14 percent).  

Almost  all  the  farming  households  (91  percent)  in  the  assessed  districts  grew  cereal  while  the 
share  of  cassava  was  very  low  at  9  percent.  Cassava  production  though  high  in  volume 
nationally,  is  mostly confined to northern and western Zambia  where  it’s consumed as a staple 
food  together  with  maize.  Among  the  assessed  districts  only  23  percent  of  the  farming 
households  produced  cassava  while  only  a  mere  22  percent  of  the  households  reported 
consuming cassava either as a staple or snack. Although almost half (48 percent) of the assessed 
farmers  produced  sweet  potatoes,  land  put  to  the  crop  is  very  small,  limiting  the  output  as  its 
mostly grown to be consumed as a snack. While legumes are known to contribute significantly to 
nutritional requirement to help reduce malnutrition, less than half (43 percent) of farmers in the 
assessed  districts  produced  any  legumes  with  groundnuts  (53  percent)  and  bean  (37  percent) 
being  the  only  legumes  grown.  Production  of  both  soybeans  and  cowpeas  was  undertaken  by 
only  4  percent  and  5  percent  of  the  assessed  farming  households  respectively.  This  trend  has 
continued for several years as maize production takes precedence.

level  of  vulnerability  when 
maize  fails. The productivity of

provision 
Government 
subsidized  inputs  to  support  its 
production  remains  a  source  of  concern.  The  gains  in  increased  production  over  the  last  four 
years  which  has  resulted  in  Zambia  achieving  consecutive  years  of  surplus  production  can  be 
better  attributed  to  increase  in  area  put  to the  crop  as  maize  yields  among  small  scale  farmers 
have remained low.

In the assessed districts, the off season maize production was rather limited with only 12 percent 
of the farmers intending to engage in the activity in 2013 similar to the previous season. The lack 
of  interest in off season  maize production was  mostly attributed to limited  viable wetlands and 
therefore  production  was  confined  to  districts  near  water  bodies.  Of  the  farming  households 
assessed, only 42 percent intend to engage in off season vegetable production and of these, not 
more than 34 percent conduct any irrigation. These very low levels of engagement in irrigation 
are  of  great  concern  considering  that  most  of  these  assessed  districts  are  prone  to  dry  spells 
during the main production season. The low use of irrigation was mostly (70 percent) attributed 
to fields  being  far  from water source and  limited  wetlands. This underscores the  importance of 
small  scale  farmer  irrigation  schemes.  Vegetable  production  is  most  commonly  practiced  in 
Kalabo,  Lukulu,  Limulunga,  Mulobezi,  Sinazongwe,  Mafinga  and  Zambezi  where  vegetable 
sales is a significant source of income during the off season period.

3.5.4. Conservation Farming and Use of Manure  

Although the  conservation  farming technique  has been widely demonstrated over several  years 
among the small scale farmers and the benefits are well known, the practice remains limited even 
in  low  rainfall  areas.    Among  the  assessed  districts  only  16percent  of  the  farming  households 
reported  practicing  conservation  farming.  Equally  of  concern  is  the  continued  low  (11percent) 
usage  of  manure  even  in  these  major  livestock  keeping  districts  a  practice  which  could  be  of 
major  benefit  for  the  farmers  in  helping  boost  productivity  as  fertilizer  application  in  many 
instances is below recommended quantities with cost being a limiting factor. 

 

3.5.5. Livestock Production and Fisheries 

Most assessed farming households (66 percent) own livestock with the male headed households 
accounting  for  85  percent  while  female  headed  only  accounted  for  15  percent.  The  most 
livestock owned  by  the  households  is  chickens  followed  by  cattle,  goats  and  pigs  (See  Figure 
remaining 

the

livestock was very low.

Cattle  rearing  in  the  assessed  district 
was a vital livelihood. Crop production 
and  sales  was 
the  major 
livelihood  followed  by  gardening  and 
livestock  production.  The  districts  with  the  least  cattle  population  were  Itezhi  tezhi,  Chirundu, 
Mafinga, Zambezi, Lukulu, Siavonga and Kazungula which accounted for only 10 percent of the 
total  cattle  population  in  the  forty-  four  (44)  districts.  Most  of  these  represent  the  asset  poor 
whose main livelihood is subsistence farming followed by brewing and casual employment.

31

 

Generally, the population of goats and pigs increased in the 2012/13 season with respect to the 
previous  season  as  gains  in  reproduction  surpassed  losses  due  to  deaths  and  sales.  The  loss  of 
cattle  and  chickens  through  death  was  significant  which  can  be  linked  to  recurring  livestock 
diseases  outbreak.  Due  to  the  high  value  placed  on  cattle  as  an  asset,  means  to  cultivate  land 
(draught power) as well as insurance against poor rainfall performance, sales are low and usually

Households (percentage)  

done  as  a  last  resort  in  periods  of  food  deficit.  Consumption  of  livestock  is  equally  low 
especially for large livestock (cattle, pigs and goats) – See figure 19. This implies that most of 
the livestock is kept as a source of income and insurance against poor crop performance. 

Although  fishing  was  reported  as  the  main  livelihood  only  in  Nalolo  district  and  many  other 
Western  Province  districts  consider  it  as  one  of  the  major  three  livelihoods.  These  districts 
include  Senanga,  Sikongo,  Shang’ombo,  Sioma  and  Mitete  where  fish  sale  is  an  important 
income  source.  Other  districts  where  fishing  is  an  important  activity  include  Itezhi-tezhi, 
Chikankata,  Gwembe,  Siavonga,  Sinazongwe  and  Luangwa.  Almost  all  these  districts  benefit 
from  the  Zambezi  River  for  source of  fish.  The  assessment  results  indicated  that  many  fishing 
households were reporting  some reduction  in  fish catches.  This  should  be a source of concern 
and while this is being attributed to the impact of the erratic rainfall/prolonged dry spells, poor 
fishing  methods  cannot  be  ignored  as  a  major  contributor  to  reduced  fish  catches,  as  reported 
annually in districts along the Zambezi River.

3.5.6. Food Security 

The results have revealed that majority of households from the forty four (44) assessed districts 
have reported marked reduction in the production of their main staple crops by forty seven (47) 
percent. Within the 44 districts eighteen (18) that experienced a reduction in staple production of 
sixty percent and above; and has higher proportion of households that are asset poor (60%) were 
identified as requiring food relief. (Refer to Food Needs Table in Annex 3.1. for the districts). A 
further  18  districts  that  experienced  a  reduction  in  the  staple  production  of  between  20  and  40 
percent were also put on monitoring to see how the food security parameters would unfold (see 
Annex 3.2.).

3.6.1.  Comparison  Sickness  Levels  between  the  2  last  weeks  prior  to  the  assessment  and 

January-March 2012  

 

The assessment showed that there was a difference in RTI data collected last two weeks prior to 
the assessment and those from January to March 2013 in that there were more RTI cases reported 
two  weeks  prior  to  the  assessment  than  it  was  during  January  to  March  2013  (see  Figure  22 
below).

percent of the population got water from sources located beyond 100m but less than 500m from 
their homes while 11.8 percent of the people accessed water from sources located beyond 500m.  
 
3.7.4. Treatment of Drinking Water  
The number of households in the assessed districts that indicated that they treated drinking water 
was 268,553 which represented 31percent of the 859,882 people. This was a significantly smaller 
compared to 52percent households that never treated their drinking water (see figure 28). 
 
Figure 25: Overview of population using treated and untreated water 
 

Generally,  the  population  in  the 
assessed  districts  confirmed 
that 
majority  of  people  (85  percent)  did 
not treat drinking water with only a 
few people (15 percent) that  treated 
their water 
 
The  assessment  has  shown  that 
education  level  of  the  household 
heads to some extent does influence 
the treating of water for drinking. In 
view  of  this,  the  assessment  has 
revealed that thirty four percent (34 
percent) of the household heads that have attained primary/basic education and thirty two percent 
(32 percent) that have attained secondary/higher education indicated treated water for drinking. It 
is however worth noting that there are few household heads that have attained tertiary education 
(21  percent)  and  have  never  been  to  school  (23  percent)  that  indicated  not  treating  water  for 
drinking. 
 
When treatment of water was analysed according to employment status of the household heads, 
the  results  indicated  that  fifty  percent  (50  percent)  of  those  in  formal  employment  treated 
drinking water with the other fifty percent (50 percent) not treating the water. Low proportion of 
the informally employed and the unemployed household heads treated drinking water (see figure 
28).   The assessment has  shown that the  most reason why treatment of water for drinking  has 
been  poor  is  due  to  lack  of  availability  of  chlorine  (13  percent),  no  money  to  buy  chlorine 
(9percent) and used in drinking untreated water. The survey showed that there were variances in 
the households’ treatment of water  for drinking.  Of the  household that  indicated treating water 
for  drinking,  thirty  three  percent  (33  percent)  came  from  household  heads  who  are  informally 
employed,  twenty  six  (26  percent),  twenty  six  percent  (26  percent)  formally  employed  and 
twenty five percent (25 percent) unemployed

households that are using  no  facility (bush or CAT  method) regardless of their education  level 
attained,  have  been  found  to  be  asset  poor  (29  percent)  and  asset  medium  (29  percent) 
respectively. 
 

3.7. Education 
 

The assessment results have indicated that 1-2 school going children were absent while less than 
1  percent  of  households  with  3  or  more  children  were  absent  from  school  due  to  floods.  This 
shows that the effect of floods on school attendance was not very significant and that the floods 
affected both boys and girls in the same way without exerting more pressure on any one gender.

Under  The  Food  support  programme  12  percent  of  rural  communities  received  food  while  88 
percent did not. As for the urban areas assessed 11 percent received support while 89 percent did 
not access any form of school feeding as indicated from the table below.

3.9.1 Household Displacement According to Type of structures 

The  assessment  showed  that  the  majority  of  the  households  that  were  displaced  lived  in 
traditional  huts  (pole  &  mud)  accounting  for  67  percent  followed  by  those  in  improved 
traditional  hut  (unburnt  bricks)  accounting  for  20  percent.  This  is  in  line  with  previous 
vulnerability and needs assessment conducted which revealed that most of the people displaced 
live in weak structures made of mud and pole.

4.0. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

4.1. Early Warning and Preparedness Measures 

Conclusion 

Although  information  was  widely  disseminated  only  24  percent  indicated  having  received 
through radio and television and   acted on it.  

 

Recommendations 

Short term 

•  Conduct  sensitization  campaigns  on  the  need  to  take  appropriate  preparedness  and 

mitigation measures upon receipt of early warning information. 

•  Review the packaging of early warning information for easy interpretation by end users.  

 

Medium to Long term 

•  Expand the coverage of the hydro-meteorological station network. 

•  Expand  the  radio  coverage  in  all  the  districts  in  the  country  such  as  community  radio 

stations as they are the most viable mode of disseminating early warning information. 

•  Expand  the  television  coverage  in  all  the  districts  in  the  country  in  order  to  enhance 

access to early warning information by all citizens. 

• 

 Establish community led early warning infrastructure and systems. 

 

4.2. Agriculture and Food Security 

Conclusion 

•  Crop production was most impacted while impact on livestock was low to moderate and 
markets were hardly  impacted. The large promotion of  maize production at the expense 
of other crops has made maize a mono crop in almost all the assessed districts such that 
negative impact on maize exposes farmers to food insecurity. Unfortunately, majority of 
maize producing areas recorded a major among drop in the production of this cereal, with 
the Southern Province recording the largest maize production drop at 21 percent mainly 
due to the late start of season and erratic rainfall. 

 

44

 

• 

Impact on livestock will be felt more in the coming months as water and pasture become 
limited  resulting  in  possible  deterioration  of    some  livestock  condition  especially  for 
cattle more so for Mazabuka,  Monze, Pemba, Kalomo, Namwala and Chikankata which 
have large cattle population. 

•  Of the 44 districts that experienced some shocks, eighteen districts will be eligible for a 

relief and rehabilitation programme to run for the next eight months.  

Recommendations 

Short Term: 

• 

• 

It  is  recommended  that  the  Extension  Services  be  enhanced  to  promote  farmers 
production of fodder to provide additional food for livestock during the dry season. 

 Owing  to  the  reduced  nutritional  levels  that  livestock  will  experience,  it  is  also 
recommended that livestock disease surveillance be enhanced. 

•  There is need for restocking of fish in several water bodies in the country. There is also 
need  for the continued sensitization of  fisher folks to reduce the practices of using poor 
fishing methods. 

•  To  help  reduce  the  food  deficit  during  the  year,  it  is  recommended  that  those  districts 
already  practicing  off  season  production  (vegetables)  be  given  inputs  to  help  them 
revamp this practice. The input support will use the e-voucher system for the distribution 
of the commodities in this programme. 

• 

It is recommended that deliberate effort be made to help increase crop diversification by 
promotion of e-vouchers for the FISP.  

•  A  total  of  209,  498  people  (34,  916  households)  be  provided  with  food  support (maize 
equivalent)  amounting  to  12,  570  MT  in  18  districts  for the  period  of  eight  (8)  months 
starting 1st August 2013 through to 31st March 2014. Twenty percent (20 percent) of the 
caseload to be under General Food Distribution (chronically vulnerable). 

•  There is need to monitor the evolution of the food security situation in 18 districts that are 

on the borderline as well as those targeted for food support. 

Medium to Long Term 

• 

It is recommended that the extension services be enhanced to promote farmers production 
of fodder/silage to provide additional food for livestock during the dry season. 

•  There will be need for Government to conduct livestock restocking which should include 

enhancing of livestock management to ensure livestock does not become lean.  

 

45

 

•  Promotion  of  conservation  farming  and  use  of  manure  to  increase  productivity  in 

marginal producing districts.  

• 

In view of the climate change effects that the country has already started experiencing, it 
is  recommended  to  design  and  implement  adaptation  programmes  such  as  use  of 
appropriate seed varieties and farming technologies. 

Health 

Short-term 

•  Strengthen  Community  Health  Promotion  and  behavioural  changes  activities  in  all  the 

affected districts.  

•  Development, procurement and distribution of Information Education and Communication 

(IEC) materials. 

•  Prevent and  improve case  management of  malaria, diarrhoeal diseases and RTI  in all the 

district reporting high incidences especially in children 0-59months of age.  

•  Strengthen  implementation  of  the  Integrated  Management  of  Child  Illnesses  (IMCI) 

strategy. 

•  Provision of Insecticide Treated Mosquito Nets (ITNs) for prevention of vector – human 

contact. 

•  Provision of Rapid Diagnostic Testing Kits (RDTs) for easy and early detection of positive 

cases of Malaria.  

•  Provision of essential drugs (anti-malarial drugs) for the treatment of malaria cases. 
•  Strengthen community participation in good hygiene practices and waste disposal to 

prevent diarrhoeal diseases. 

 

Medium to Long-term 

•  Strengthen malaria intervention, in accordance with National Health Strategic Plan. 
• 

Implement Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST) methodology 
to improve community health. 
Improve access to health services through the strengthening of the primary health care 
system and Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) outreach programs providing 
immunization, vitamin A supplementation and behavior change communication on  early 
health seeking behaviur especially for children under the age of five. 
Initiate/ expand programs to provide surveillance for notifiable diseases such as 
Diarrrhoel diseases. 

• 

• 

•  Rehabilitation of Health Infrastructure those would be affected and flood affected health 

facilities.

4.3. Water and Sanitation 

Conclusion 

•  Boreholes,  unprotected  wells  and  piped  water  continue  to  be  the  most  common  water 

sources used by most households in the assessed districts. 

•  Despite prolonged dry spells having had affected most southern parts of the country, no 

negative impacts on dwindling water resources were observed 

•  The common treatment  method  for water has  been  found to application of chlorine and 

boiling 

•  The common sanitary facilities used by most households in the assessed districts were the 

traditional latrines. 

•  A  good  proportion  of  households  from  the  assessed  districts  still  used  the  bush  (no 

facility) as alternative sanitary facilities. 

 

Recommendations 

 
Water 
Short – term 

•  Accelerate  water  supply  investments  in  all  districts  as  an  integrated  package  with 
sanitation  which  should  include  construction  and  improvement  of  water  points 
(boreholes, hand dug wells, springs, and traditional water sources). 

•  Rehabilitation of existing water points which are in a deplorable state. 
•  Roll-out  to  all  districts  the  operation  and  maintenance  system  for  water  points  from 

• 

district to community level.  
Increase availability of chlorine at household to enhance treatment of water for drinking 
in all the affected districts. 

 

Medium and Long term 

•  Formulate the Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) Policy and review Legal Framework, 

taking into considerations of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Act. 

•  Strengthen  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  activities  in  Commercial 
Utilities  (CUs)  and  Local  Authorities  (LAs)  to  ensure  effective  service  delivery  at 
national, district and community levels.  

•  Establish  knowledge  sharing  and  facilitating  centers  to  spearhead  research  and 
development  on  appropriate  design  of  technologies;  piloting  and  wide  promotion  of 
technically appropriate service delivery mechanisms. 

•  Promote  rainwater  harvesting  facilities  and  spring  protection  and  utilization  to  improve 

access to safe drinking water. 
 
 

 

47

 

Sanitation 
Short – term 

•  Construct  demonstration  latrines  at  rural  community  centres  at  strategic  points  such  as 
schools,  markets,  faith  centres,  and  traditional  chiefs’  villages.  This  will  provide  an 
opportunity to demonstrate appropriate technologies which the communities can adopt to 
improve their sanitation facilities. 
 

Medium and Long Term 

•  Promote  integrated  development  and  management  of  water  supply,  sanitation  and 
hygiene  education  based  on  the  WASHE  (Water,  Sanitation  and  Hygiene  Education) 
strategy. 

• 

•  Roll out Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) in rural areas to increase and improve 
the  number  of  adequate  sanitation  facilities  by  encouraging  communities  to  construct 
latrines and promote health and hygiene education. 
Implement existing government policy on sanitation and hygiene facilities that encourage 
construction  of  adequate  latrine  structures  using  locally  available  materials  in  rural 
districts.  
 
 

4.4. Education 

Conclusion 

 

 

•  The  assessment  established  that  the  main  reason  for  children  not  attending  school  was 
damaged  infrastructure (roads and  bridges)  followed  by  flooding and children engaging 
in other activities.  

•  The  assessment  further  revealed  that  14  districts  had  number  of  school  infrastructure 

damaged. 

Recommendations 

Short Term: 

•  Rehabilitation  of  damaged  school  infrastructure  to  ensure  children  return  to  school  as 

soon as the floods reside 

•  Expansion  of  school  feeding  programmes  in  36  districts  of  Central,  Eastern,  Luapula, 

Lusaka, Muchinga, Western and North-Western provinces. 

 

 

 

48

 

Medium to Long Term 

• 

Inclusion  of  issues  on  climate  change  adaptation  and  disaster  risk  management  in  the 
curriculum.  

•  Upgrading  of  temporary  school  infrastructure  such  as  community  schools  to  permanent 

status to ensure stability even in times of floods. 

 Ensure  constant  monitoring  of  on-going  infrastructure  development  for  quality 
assurance. 

• 

  

4.5. Social Protection 

Conclusion 

The  main  safety  net  being  accessed  by  most  households  in  the  assessed  districts  was  input 
support.  

 

Recommendations 

•  Provide  social  cash  transfers  to  affected  households  for  them  access  other  basics  needs 
such as health, transport other than food where much of their expenditures go. Priority to 
be the 20% of the households targeted for the general food distribution. 

 

4.6. Habitation and Human Shelter 

Conclusion 

The 2013  assessment revealed that 256 households (1536 people) of the total  households were 
displaced by floods. The worst affected provinces were Western followed by Central, Southern 
and North Western. The districts with the highest number of displaced households were Sikongo, 
Nalolo, Mitete, Namwala, Limulunga, Zambezi and Itezhi-tezhi. The majority of those displaced 
were found in the rural areas. 

 
 
Recommendations 

•  There is need to Sensitize populations residing in flood prone areas on the importance of 

relocating to higher grounds. 

•  Sensitize  populations  on  alternative  sustainable  livelihood  sources  especially  those 

engaged in fishing

Annex 2: Survey Methodology 

 

A.  Target Population 

People living in the districts identified to have been affected by either dry spells or floods during 
the  2012/2013  rainfall  season  or  experienced  army  worm  attacks.    A  total  of  44  districts  were 
targeted. 

 

B.  Sampling Frame 

Zambia is administratively divided into ten (10) provinces. Each province is in turn subdivided 
into  districts.  Each  district  is  further  subdivided  into  constituencies  and  wards.  For  statistical 
purposes  each  ward  is  subdivided  into  Census  Supervisory  Areas  (CSAs)  which,  in  turn,  are 
subdivided  into  Standard  Enumeration  Areas  (SEAs).  The  SEAs  are  geographical  areas, 
classified as either rural or urban, have information on number of households and the population 
size. This demarcation is done through a mapping exercise. The last mapping exercise was done 
prior to the 2010 Census of Population and Housing. 
 
A  national  frame,  which  is  a  listing  of  all  SEAs  in  the  country,  is  a  product  of  the  mapping 
exercise. Based on the Census results, data collected during the mapping exercise was updated. 
The frame has 25, 631 SEAs and 2,815, 897 households.  
 
A  listing  of  SEAs  in  all  the  44  districts  was  the  sampling  main  frame  for  the  2013  In-Depth 
Vulnerability and Assessment Survey. 
 

C.  Sample execution 

Based mainly on the total number of districts affected districts and availability of resources, the 
survey  was  designed  to  cover  660  SEAs  or  6,600  households.  Each  district  was  allocated  15 
SEAs  or  150  households.  The  actual  number  of  households  that  were  covered  was  6,418, 
resulting  in  a  coverage  rate of  97.3  percent. Table  below  gives  details  on  how  the  sample  was 
implemented.

D.  Sampling Method 

The  2013  In-Depth  Vulnerability  and  Assessment  Survey  employed  probability  sampling 
procedures.  The  sample  was  selected  using  a  stratified  two-stage  sampling  method. In  the  first 
stage,  15  SEAs  were  selected  using  the  Probability  Proportional  to  Estimated  Size  (PPES) 
procedure. During the second stage, 10 households were randomly selected from each SEA.  

E.  Selection of SEAs 

A cluster is an ultimate area unit retained in the survey. In this survey, a cluster corresponds to a 
Standard Enumeration Area (SEA), which was the primary sampling unit. 

The procedure for selecting SEAs in each district involved: 

(i) 

For each district, a list of SEAs, ordered by SEA identification numbers was developed.   
The list included, for each SEA, the number of households and the cumulated measure of 
size (by adding the number of households down the list).  

(ii) 

For each district, a sampling  interval, (

 

54

 

F.  Selection of households 

For this survey, no listing of households was done. However, all the SEAs that were selected for 
the survey had a known number of households, based on information from the sampling frame.  

The following steps will be used to select the households: 

Let M=the total number of households in a selected SEA 

n=the number of households to be selected from each a SEA 

1.  A sampling interval for the SEA was calculated as: M/n=I 

2.  Once  an  enumerator  was  in  an  enumeration  area,  a  convenient  starting  point  for  the 
enumeration.  This  point  was  a  household  which  was  conveniently  located  to  facilitate  the 
application  of  the  sampling  interval.  Once  this  first  household  was  enumerated,  the 
enumerator  was  applying  the  interval  by  enumerating  every  ith  household  as  he/she  moves 
systematically in the SEA until ten (10) households are enumerated. 

G.  Reliability of Estimates 

Reliability of estimates in the 2012 In-Depth Vulnerability and Assessment Survey was affected 
by both sampling and non-sampling errors. 

To  reduce  sampling  errors,  a  sufficient  sample  size  was  determined  for  this  survey.  Sampling 
errors  were  further  minimized  by  using  a  stratified  sample  design.  The  sample  was  explicitly 
stratified into 18 strata and implicit stratification was provided by ordering or sorting the list of 
SEAs for each district. 

To minimize non-sampling errors, a high level of control on all known sources of error was done 
efficiently  and  effectively  in  the  planning  and  implementation  of  the  survey,  mostly  through 
testing of the questionnaire and very close supervision of field and data entry staff.  

H.  Derivation of analysis weights 

Weighted  analysis  of  sample  survey  results  is  needed  to  achieve  unbiased  or  nearly  unbiased 
estimates  of  population  parameters.  Weights  compensate  for  unequal  selection  probabilities.  In 
order for the survey estimates to be representative at district level, it was necessary to weight the 
sample data with appropriate expansion factors.  The weight for each sample unit is equal to the 
reciprocal/ inverse of its probability of selection. 

The probability of selecting cluster i was calculated as;

Where: Phi is the first stage sampling probability of (SEA), ah is the number of SEAs selected in 
district h, Mhi is the size (households according to the Census frame) of the ith SEA in district h, 
and ΣMhi is the total size of the district. 

The selection probability of the household was calculated as:
