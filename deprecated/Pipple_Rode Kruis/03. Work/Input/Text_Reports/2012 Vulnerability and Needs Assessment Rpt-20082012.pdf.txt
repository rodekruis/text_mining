Executive Summary 

The performance of the 2011/2012 rainy season was mixed with parts of the northern half receiving heavy 

rains while the most of the southern half was characterized with dry spells. Most of the areas in Southern 

Province that experienced dry spells did so through-out the season.   

The floods and  dry spells arising  from this scenario  impacted negatively  on  key  economic sectors. This 

resulted in damaged infrastructure; some crops being destroyed, increased risk of both human and animal 

diseases, localized food insecurity and school disruption.  Several districts reported the devastation caused 

by  the  floods.  Districts  that  faced  dry  spells  also  indicated  that  there  was  looming  food  insecurity 

emanating from the hazard.  

Following reports from the District Disaster Management Committees (DDMC) in eighteen (18) districts 

Central,  Eastern,  Lusaka,  Muchinga,  Northern,  North-Western,  Southern  and  Western  Provinces  on  the 

negative  effects  of  floods  and/or  dry  spells,  the  Zambia  Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee  (ZVAC) 

undertook  an  in  –  depth  assessment.  The  districts  where  the  assessments  were  undertaken  included 

Chama,  Chavuma,  Chikankata,  Gwembe,    Kazungula,    Luangwa,  Luwingu,  Mafinga,  Mambwe, 

Mazabuka, Monze, Mufumbwe, Mumbwa, Mwinilunga, Namwala, Sesheke, Siavonga and Zambezi. 

The assessment employed the qualitative and quantitative approaches in the collection of data. A total of 

2, 701 households in 270 Standard Enumeration Areas (SEAs) in eighteen (18) districts with an estimated 

population  of  1,758,499  people  were  assessed.  Under  the  quantitative  approach,  structured  household 

questionnaires  were  used  in  270  SEAs.  Under  the  qualitative  approach,  community  interviews  were 

conducted in all the 270 SEAs while one district interview was conducted in each of the districts assessed. 

Anthropometric data was collected for under-five children in all the 270 SEAs.  

Major Findings 

•  The assessment established that a total of 353, 002 people (58, 834 households) were affected by 

the floods and/or dry spells in one way or another. 

•  The  assessment  established  that  there  was  a  slight  improvement  on  the  number  of  people  who 

were warned about the flooding or the dry spell situation from last season. The survey indicated 

that  30.9  percent  of  people  in  the  surveyed  districts  indicated  having  been  warned  of  the 

impending hazard, which is about 10 percentage points better than the previous season. Majority 

of  those  that  indicated  having  been  warned  (87.1  percent)  said  the  information  came  from  the 

Zambia Meteorological Department (ZMD).

•  The assessment showed that the main livelihoods of the people in the assessed districts have not 

changed owing to the shocks. The main livelihood was agriculture (crop production) followed by 

formal employment and petty trading as the third most important livelihood. 

•  The  impact  assessment  has  also  shown  that  of  the  highest  proportion  of  households  who  are 

categorized  as  asset  poor,  majority  were  found  in  Gwembe  (87%),  Chama  (84%),  Mambwe 

(81%),  Zambezi  (81%)  and  Sesheke  (80%)  districts  respectively.  There  was  also  substantial 

population that had their asset base categorized as asset medium with 61% observed in Mumbwa, 

53% in Namwala, 37% in Mafinga and Mufumbwe districts. 

• 

It  was  also  established  that  majority  of  the  households  have  good  food  consumption  scores 

(80%).  Notably  the  assessment  has  also  shown  that,  of  the  80%  of  households  that  have  good 

food consumption scores, 62% are asset poor with 38% asset  medium. This  implies that despite 

having  poor  to  medium  asset  base,  most  of  the  households  that  are  predominantly  rural  based 

continue to have good dietary diversity largely due easy access to own produced foods as well as 

seasonal foods during assessment period. 

•  The assessment has shown that 82% of the male headed households have good food consumption 

score compared to 75% of the female headed households. The assessment has further shown that 

more  female  headed  households  (20%)  have  their  food  consumption  scores  falling  within 

borderline.  

•  The majority (62%) of the households in the eighteen assessed districts purchased/acquired inputs 

(seed  and  fertilizer)  for  the  2011/2012  production  season.  This  signifies  an  improvement  in  the 

use  of  improved  seed  and  fertilizer  over  the  past  years  when  small  scale  farmers  used  a  lot  of 

recycled seed and little fertilizer in crop production. 

•  The  impact  on  crops  was  more  severe  in  Chama,  Gwembe,  Mazabuka  and  Monze  based  on  at 

least 60% of the key informants in these districts. The impact on livestock on the other hand was 

mostly low to none with only Gwembe reporting moderate impact. There was little or no impact 

of  the  rainfall  performance  on  market  access  in  the  assessed  districts  implying  that  households 

were able to easily access markets during the just ended marketing season. 

•  At least 83% of the farming households in the assessed districts grew maize while production of 

the  other cereals was  negligible  during the  main  growing season. With the  increased production 

of maize at the expense of other food crops, the share of legumes has remained low. 

•  The results show that on average, most of the households in assessed districts produced less than 

40 x 50Kg bags of maize each with only 25% producing more than 40 bags. In the typically low 

 | P a g e  

 

x

producing  areas  which  made  up  the  majority  of  assessed  districts  (represented  by  Gwembe),  at 

least 70% of the households produced less than 10 bags of maize each. 

• 

.  Among  the  assessed  districts  Namwala,  Monze,  Mazabuka  and  Mumbwa  districts  have  the 

highest  cattle  (>100,000)  and  goat  (80,000  –  140,000)  population.  Although  less  in  numbers, 

cattle  and  goat  population  is  also  significant  in  the  marginal  crop  producing  areas  of  Sesheke, 

Gwembe, Siavonga and Kazungula with cattle population estimated at 30,000 to 50,000. Results 

indicate  that  in  the  major  cattle  rearing  districts,  cattle  numbers  remained  relatively  stable  or 

mostly dropped by less than 15% between 2010/11 and 2011/12 season. This is encouraging and 

could partially be attributed to the continued cattle vaccinations. 

•  The  nutrition  status  of  children  was  assessed  in  the  18  districts.  Approximately  52.8%  of  the 

children  assessed  were  stunted;  5  %  wasted;  33.2%  underweight  (Table  18).  The  prevalence  of 

severe  stunting  in  the  sample  was  44.8  %,  while  the  prevalence  of  severe  wasting  and 

underweight were 2.6% and 21.3% respectively. 

•  The  prevalence  of  stunting  in  the  assessed  districts  was  lower  than  WHO  cut-off  point  of  20%, 

signifying  that  there  is  no  public  health  problem.  Stunting  rates  were  highest  for  Mambwe 

(12.7%),  Mwinilunga  (8.4%)  and  Monze  (7.4%)  districts.  The  highest  rates  of  wasting  were  in 

Namwala  (1.2%),  Gwembe  (1.2%)  and  Kazungula  (1.1%).  The  underweight  children  were 

highest in Mambwe (7.5%), Mwinilunga (5.7%), (19.2%) and Monze (4.0%) districts. 

•  On  average  55  %  of  the  household  members  reported  having  Clinical  Malaria.  In  7  out  of  18 

districts  in  survey  the  households’  members  saw  more  than  60  malaria  cases.  Moreover,  the 

figure  2  below  depicts  the  prevalence  of  common  illnesses  (symptoms  of  Fever  /Malaria, 

Diarrhoea, Skin Infection and Cough/Respiratory Infection) by type of disease and district among 

households that had at least one sick member. 

•  On  average  55  %  of  the  household  members  reported  having  Clinical  Malaria.  In  7  out  of  18 

districts  in  survey  the  households’  members  saw  more  than  60  malaria  cases.  Moreover,  the 

figure  2  below  depicts  the  prevalence  of  common  illnesses  (symptoms  of  Fever  /Malaria, 

Diarrhoea, Skin Infection and Cough/Respiratory Infection) by type of disease and district among 

households that had at least one sick member. 

•  At district level, the results further reveal that boreholes dominate as sources of water in thirteen 

districts. 

•  A comparison of water availability during the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 seasons, as indicated by 

63.5% of households remained the same. Other households (26.5%) reported that the quantity of 

 | P a g e  

 

xi

water from the water sources had reduced. A small percentage of households (10%) revealed that 

the quantity of water had increased. 

•  The  number of  households using traditional  latrine facilities showed the  highest  value, followed 

by  those  without  any  facility  at  all  while  the  bucket  method  showed  the  least  value.  From  the 

results  obtained  from  the  households  sampled,  the  number  of  households  with  flash  toilets  and 

VIP latrines are at 3.4 and 1.4% respectively which is very low as compared to 65.4% households 

with traditional latrines. 

•  Of  the  school  infrastructure  reported  damaged,  18.8  %  had  their  roofs  blown  off,  whilst  ratios 

9.4% were recorded for having developed cracks being in deplorable state and collapsing totally. 

Of  the  schools  surveyed  40%  were  reported  to  be  unaffected  by  floods,  and  only  9.4%  were 

reported to be in good condition. 

•  The assessment revealed that out of all the flood affected households in the 18 districts, only 0.3 

percent (1,115) households claimed to have been displaced. This translates to about 6,690 people 

having  been  displaced  in  the  three  districts  of  Chama,  Chavuma  and  Mambwe.  Of  the  three 

districts, Mambwe  was the  worst affected  with 55.5 percent  of the  displaced population coming 

from that district.  

 

Conclusions   

 

The assessment established that a total of 238,254 people (39,709 households) were affected by the floods 

and/or dry spells in one way or another. 

The sector specific conclusions are reflected below: 

Infrastructure 

 

The  assessment  established  that  there  was  significant  damage  done  to  roads,  health  and  school 

infrastructure. About 311 road, bridges and drainage structures were damaged and need to be reinstated. 

The school and health infrastructure has been covered under the respective sectors.

Agriculture and Food Security 

Generally, most assessed areas were mostly impacted by erratic rainfall and the magnitude varied among 

the  districts  with  Chavuma,  Chikankata,  Gwembe,  Mambwe  and  Mazabuka  being  most  affected.  The 

impact was high on crops while impact on livestock and market access was extremely low.  

The  food  security  up  to  the  end  of  the  2012/13  marketing  and  consumption  season  was  generally 

favourable and this was supported by lack of strong evidence of food stress, as no unusual strategies were 

being  employed by  households to  meet basic food  needs. The Food Consumption Score for  most  of the 

districts was very good.  

The livestock situation was more stable with few districts reporting disease. This implies that the current 

livestock  disease  control  is  helping  to  keep  diseases  in  check.  Effective  control  through  current 

vaccination programs should be supported. 

Based  on  maize  production,  the  five  (5)  districts  (Chavuma,  Chikankata,  Gwembe,  Mambwe  and 

Mazabuka)  that  experienced  a  reduction  in  the  harvest  of  the  main  staple  will  therefore  need  to  be 

targeted for intervention to sustain the livelihoods of the affected communities.

to  avoid  loss  of  life  or  children  missing.  It  could  also  help  to  transport  children  to  schools 

across flooded rivers. 

 

5.7. Social Protection 

 

There is need for the Ministry of Community Development and Social Services (MCDSS) and its partners 

to:  

 

  Short-term 

• 

empower  families  that  are  keeping  orphans  and  vulnerable  children;  incapacitated  and 

low capacity households and individuals; 

•  provide farming inputs to vulnerable but viable farmers in disaster prone areas; 

•  Sensitize the communities on the dangers of gender based violence,  

•  Provide  psycho-social  support  and  counseling  to  victims/survivors  of  gender  based 

violence.  

• 

 Initiate and promote family and community safety during disasters. 

xvi

 | P a g e  

 

 Medium to Long term 

•  Build  capacities  of  law  enforcement  agencies  such  as  the  police  service,  immigration 

department and community support groups to monitor gender based violence. 

 

5.8. Human Habitation and Shelter 

 

Medium to long term 

•  Safer lands to be identified on the uplands and be provided with basic infrastructure such as 

boreholes, health and educational services for the resettling of the flood displaced persons. 

•  Sensitize  population  residing  in  flood  prone  areas  on  the  importance  of  relocating  to  higher 

grounds. 

• 

Introduce  alternative  sustainable  livelihood  sources  for  the  resettled  populations  e.g.  bee 

keeping.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

The  performance  of  the  2011/2012  rainy  season  was  mixed  with  parts  of  the  northern  half 

receiving heavy rains while the most of the southern half was characterized with dry spells. Most 

of the areas in Southern Province that experienced dry spells did so through-out the season.   

The  floods  and  dry  spells  arising  from  this  scenario  impacted  negatively  on  key  economic 

sectors.  This  resulted  in  damaged  infrastructure, some  crops  being  destroyed,  increased  risk  of 

both  human  and  animal  diseases,  localized  food  insecurity  and  school  disruption.    Several 

districts  reported  the  devastation  caused  by  the  floods.  Districts  that  faced  dry  spells  also 

indicated that there was looming food insecurity emanating from the hazard. In view of the cross 

-  cutting  impact  of  the  floods  and  dry  spells,  there  is  need  to  get  in-depth  information  for 

establishing the extent of the problem and  implications  for the affected population  in the short, 

medium  and  long  term  period.  This  information  will  also  form  the  basis  on  which  appropriate 

programming of the response measures will be based. 

Following reports from the District Disaster Management Committees (DDMC) in eighteen (18) districts 

Central,  Eastern,  Lusaka,  Muchinga,  Northern,  North-Western,  Southern  and  Western  Provinces  on  the 

negative  effects  of  floods  and/or  dry  spells,  the  Zambia  Vulnerability  Assessment  Committee  (ZVAC) 

undertook an in – depth assessment. The provinces and districts where the assessments were undertaken 

included the following:

The criteria used to select the above mentioned districts included the following: 

i. 

Rainfall: 

a.  Rainfall performance  in the  months  of December, January, February and dekad 1 of 

March; 

b.  Rainfall  cumulative  performance  mainly  the  decadal  cumulative  figures  for  the 

months of December, January, February and the first dekad of March ; 

ii. 

Percentage crop and livestock loss; and  

The  report,  therefore,  presents  the  findings  of  the  201  In-depth  Vulnerability  and  Needs  Assessment 

conducted  to  determine  the  extent  and  effects  of  the  floods  and/or  dry  spells  on  agriculture  and  food 

security, infrastructure, health and nutrition, water and sanitation, habitation and human shelter and social 

protection. 

Objectives 

1.2 
 

1.2.1 Overall Objective 

The  overall  objective  of the  In –  depth  Assessment  is  to assess the  impacts  of both the  dry – spells and 

floods  during  the  2011/2012  rainfall  season  in  the  affected  parts  of  the  country  in  order  to  design 

appropriate response measures.   

 

1.2.2 Specific Objectives 

i.  Determine  the  impact  of  dry  spells  and  rainfall  on  WATSAN,  Health,  food  security,  education 

and infrastructure; 

ii. 

Identify worst affected areas as well as the population affected; 

iii.  Determine the  effects of  dry spells and/or rainfall  on  nutrition status of under – five children  in 

the affected areas; 

iv.  Determine food and non-food needs if any; and 

v. 

To determine the community preparedness to hazards.

1.3 Scope of the In-Depth Vulnerability and Needs Assessment. 
 

The ZVAC conducted the In-depth  Vulnerability and  Needs  Assessment in Central, Eastern, Muchinga, 

North-Western, Northern, Southern and Western Provinces  where  eighteen  (18)  districts  were adversely 

affected  by  floods  and/or  dry  spells.  The  sectors  impacted  upon  by  the  floods  included  health  and 

nutrition,  water  and  sanitation,  education,  infrastructure,  human  shelter  and  habitation,  agriculture  and 

food security and social protection.   

The assessment was designed in such a way that data collection was conducted at three (3) levels of the 

district.  The  entry  level  for  the  teams  collecting  the  in-depth  assessment  data  was  at  the  district  level 

through  the  District  Disaster  Management  Committees  (DDMCs)  where  meetings  were  held.  The  next 

level was the community where community leaders were interviewed through Focused Group Discussions 

(FGDs). The last level was at the household level where a structure questionnaire was utilized to conduct 

the interview. 

 

1.4 Methods and Procedures 

1.4.1 Target Population 

The  target  population  is  the  number  of  people  living  in  the  districts  identified  to  have  been  affected  by 

floods  and  dry  spells  that  occurred  during  the  2011/2012  rainy  season.  A  total  of  18  districts  were 

targeted. 

1.4.2 Sampling Frame 

Zambia  is  administratively  divided  into  ten  (10)  provinces.  Each  province  is  in  turn  subdivided  into 

districts.  Each  district  is  further  subdivided  into  constituencies  and  wards.  For  statistical  purposes  each 

ward  is  subdivided  into  Census  Supervisory  Areas  (CSAs)  which,  in  turn,  are  subdivided  into  Standard 

Enumeration  Areas  (SEAs).  The  SEAs  are  geographical  areas,  classified  as  either  rural  or  urban,  have 

information  on  number  of  households  and  the  population  size.  This  demarcation  is  done  through  a 

mapping exercise.  

 

 | P a g e  

 

3

Prior  to  the  2010  Census  of  Population  and  Housing,  the  Central  Statistical  Office  (CSO)-Zambia 

conducted a  mapping  exercise. Based  on the Census results, data collected  during the  mapping  exercise 

was updated.  

 

The  national  frame  has  an  updated  list  of  Standard  Enumeration  Areas  (SEAs).  The  frame  has  25,  631 

SEAs and 2,815, 897 households. A  listing  of SEAs in all the 18 districts  was the sampling  main frame 

for the 2012 In-Depth Vulnerability and Assessment Survey. The SEAs were the primary sampling units 

for the survey. 

 

1.4.3 Sample Allocation 

The  survey  targeted  18  districts  in  8  provinces.  Provision  of  precise  survey  estimates  for  each  district 

required  that  samples  of  adequate  sizes  be  allocated  to  each  district.  Since  it  was  desired  that  estimates 

from each district have the same level of precision, an equal allocation was the most efficient strategy. 

Therefore, an equal sample of 15 clusters or 150 households was allocated to each of the 18 districts. 

1.4.4 Sampling Method 

The 2012 In-Depth  Vulnerability and  Assessment Survey  employed probability sampling procedures.  A 

two-stage  stratified  cluster  sample  design  was  used.  In  the  first  stage,  15  SEAs  were  selected  using  the 

Probability  Proportional  to  Estimated  Size  (PPES)  procedure.  During  the  second  stage,  10  households 

were  randomly  selected  from  each  enumeration  area.  Random  does  not  in  any  way  imply  haphazard; 

rather it means that each possible household had an equal chance of being selected. 

1.4.5 Sample Size 

A total of 2700 households in 270 SEAs were covered in the 18 districts with an estimated population of 

1,758,499 people. The table below shows the estimated population, PSU’s and the number of households 

covered.

Sampling  weights  are  needed  to  compensate  for  unequal  selection  probabilities,  non-coverage,  non-

response,  and  for  known  differences  between  the  sample  and  the  reference  population.  Thus  sample 

weights  act  as  boosting  factors  to  represent  the  number  of  units  in  the  survey  population  that  are 

accounted for by the sample unit to which the weight is assigned.  

 

1.5.1 Base Weights 

The  first  type  of  weight  that  is  normally  calculated  is  the  design  weight,  also  known  as  base  weight. 

Construction of the base weights for the sampled units corrects for their unequal probabilities of selection. 

The  base  weight  of  a  sampled  unit  is  the  number  of  units  in  the  population  that  are  represented  by  the 

sampled unit for purposes of estimation (UNSTATS, 2005). It is derived as a reciprocal of the probability 

of selection for inclusion in the sample. 

Since a two-stage sample  design  was used for the 2012 In-Depth  Vulnerability and  Assessment Survey, 

the base weights were constructed to reflect the probabilities of selection at each stage.

1.6 Reliability of Estimates 

Reliability of estimates in the 2012 In-Depth Vulnerability and Assessment Survey was affected by both 

sampling and non-sampling errors. 

Sampling  error  is  the  part  of  the  difference  between  a  population  value  and  an  estimate 
thereof, derived from a random sample, which is due to the fact that only a sample of values is 
observed.  Sampling  errors  arise  from  the fact that  not  all  units  of  the targeted  population  are 
enumerated, but only a sample of them. Therefore, the information collected on the units in the 
sample may not perfectly reflect the information which could have been collected on the whole 
population. The difference is the sampling error. EUROSTAT 

 

 

 

 

To reduce sampling errors, a sufficient sample size was determined for this survey. Sampling errors were 

further minimized by using a stratified sample design. The sample was explicitly stratified into 18 strata 

and implicit stratification was provided ordering or sorting the list of SEAs for each strata. 

 

Non-Sampling  error  is  an  error  in  sample  estimates  which  cannot  be  attributed  to  sampling 
fluctuations.  Non-sampling  errors  may  arise  from  many  different  sources  such  as  defects  in  the 
frame,  faulty  demarcation  of sample  units,  defects  in  the  selection  of  sample  units,  mistakes  in  the 
collection  of  data  due  to  personal  variations  or  misunderstanding  or  bias  or  negligence  or 
dishonesty  on  the  part  of  the  investigator  or  of  the  interviewer,  mistakes  at  the  stage  of  the 
processing of the data, etc. OECD 
 

 

 

 

Non-sampling  errors may  have arisen from  many  factors at all stages  of  data collection and processing. 

These include errors resulting from; 

•  Respondents misunderstanding the questions 

• 

Incorrect presentation of the questions 

•  Question specific non-response; 

•  Errors in data entry, and  

•  Errors during coding. 

The report therefore contains no quantitative assessments of these errors. Although it was not possible to 

eliminate all sources of  error, a high level  of control on all known sources  of  error was done  efficiently 

and  effectively  in  planning  and  conducting  the  survey.  Below  are  the  key  steps  that  were  taken  to 

minimize or control non-sampling errors during the survey:  

•  The most recent sampling frame, based on the 2010 Census of Population and Housing was used.  

 | P a g e  

 

7

•  Thoroughly testing questionnaires before being used in the field.  

•  Non-responding households were followed up to achieve high response rates.  

•  High quality editing and cleaning procedures were employed in processing the data.  

• 

International  standard  procedures  and  processes  were  employed  at  all  stages  of  the  survey 

process.  

 

2.  CONTEXT   

 

2.1. The Economy 
 
Zambia’s  economy  has  slowed  to  6.6%  in  2011  from  7.6%  in  2010,  mainly  as  a  result  of  a  weaker 

mining  sector  performance.  However,  the  medium  term  economic  outlook  appears  favourable 

underpinned  by  sustained  expansion  in  agriculture,  construction,  manufacturing  and  by  a 

rebound in mining.   Inflation remained in single digit, reflecting prudent monetary policy while 

the objective of exchange rate policy is to maintain external competitiveness.  

 

Increasing  domestic  revenue  collection  remains  a  priority  for  the  medium  term  and  large 

infrastructure developments will require additional resources. The government plans to raise US$ 

700  million  via  a  bond  issue  to  cover  a  funding  gap  in  infrastructure  projects.  Infrastructure 

investment  is  expected  to  boost  growth  by  up  to  up  to  2  %  per  annum.  Risks  to  the  outlook 

include  the  country’s  vulnerability  to  external  shocks  and  sluggish  global  economic  recovery, 

which could reduce demand for exports. 

 

In  terms  of  the  agricultural  sector,  total  area  planted  for  all  major  crops  increased  from  less  than  1.5 

million hectares in the 1999/2000 season to over 2.4 million hectares in the 2010/2011 season. However, 

yield  rates  continued  to  fluctuate  significantly  due  to  the  over  reliance  on  rain  fed  agriculture  by  most 

small  and  medium  scale  agricultural  households.  Total  maize  production  in  the  2010/2011  season 

increased by 8 percent to 3, 020, 380 metric tonnes compared to 2, 795, 483 metric tonnes in 2009/2010 

season.  The  country  also  recorded  a  significant  increase  in  the  production  of  barley,  primarily  for  the 

brewing  industry.  Barley  production  increased  from  1,089  metric  tonnes  in  2009/2010  season  to  8,  878 

metric tonnes in 201/2011 season.

2.2. Agriculture and Food Security 

 

Although there have been registered gains in the agricultural sector and notable contribution to the GDP 

growth in the past few years, a lot of challenges still remain. These include the following; continued low 

productivity, heavy dependency  on rain-fed agriculture, low  value addition, inappropriate and  expensive 

breeding stock as well poor infrastructure and lack of diversification. The Government has announced its 

intention  to  effectively  reform  the  sector.  The  government  intends  to  among  other  things  redesign  the 

Input  program,  strengthen  research,  invest  in  irrigation,  rehabilitate  and  develop  rural  infrastructure, 

promote crop diversification and reform the agricultural marketing system. In tackling these hindrances to 

increased agricultural contribution to the country’s  growth, the Government  hope to  ensure that benefits 

of  improved  agricultural  output  reach  the  poorest  rural  households  and  consequently  the  country  will 

begin to register reductions in the current poverty levels. 

 

2.2.1. Input Distribution 

 

In  the  last  agricultural  season,  Government  and  other  agencies  continued  to  implement  input  support 

programs,  with  the  aim  of  increasing  small-scale  farmer  access  to  inputs  for  increased  production  and 

productivity. The  major input programme  during the  20011/12 agricultural season  was the GRZ Farmer 

Input Support Programme (FISP) and the Food Security Pack. 

 

2.2.1.1. Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP) 

 

The  main  goal  of  the  FISP  is  to  increase  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  farmers’  use  of  inputs,  and 

improve the beneficiaries’ potential  of contributing to  increased food security and  incomes. The Farmer 

Input Support Programme has in the last two seasons reduced the size of the input pack to carter for some 

500,000 farmers.  The increase in the number of beneficiaries has translated in the reduction of the size of 

the pack from one hectare to half a hectare. The tangible benefit seen last season was that this has enabled 

a  more  efficient  and  effective  management  of  maize  fields  by  beneficiaries,  resulting  in  increased 

productivity. In addition to the increased number of beneficiaries and  overall  improvements  in the  input 

distribution,  the  FISP  has  also  improved  on  the  targeting  of  beneficiaries  by  involving  the  community 

through  the  Camp  Agriculture  Committees  in  selecting  beneficiaries  of  the  input  packs.  The  above 

changes have led to reduced program leakage and incidences of farmers selling-off inputs. 

 | P a g e  

 

9

2.2.1.2. Food Security Pack (FSP) 

 

In  the  last  five  to  six  years, the  Food  Security  Pack  program  has  substantially  reduced  in  terms  of  both 

coverage  and  support  to  vulnerable,  but  viable  farmers  with  implementation  being  fully  undertaken  by 

Ministry  of  Community  Development.  The  Food  Security  Pack  (FSP)  programme  is  meant  to  improve 

crop  productivity  and  household  food  security  among  targeted  vulnerable  but  viable  households  and 

thereby contribute to poverty reduction. During the period under review, the programme received a total 

of  K10  billion  from  Government  which  supported  9,000  beneficiaries.  Additionally,  there  was  funding 

from the Africa Development Bank (ADB) amounting to K14.5 billion which supported 17,227.  

 

2.2.1.3. Input Support for Wetland Crop Production 

 

Input support for wetland production which helped farmers practicing recession farming fill the food gap 

during the lean period (November to February), has significantly dropped in the last few years. Support in 

the  last  season  was  confined  to  Central  and  Western  Provinces  with  support  from  the  African 

Development Bank (ADB). The support was rendered to 6, 564 households in seven  districts of Central 

and  Western  Provinces  of  Zambia.  The  support  provided  greatly  assisted  to  fill  the  food  gap  during  the 

lean season helping enhance household food security. 

 

2.2.2.  Crop Production, Food Supply and Access 

 

Maize and cassava production have by far continued to rank very high in the country’s crop performance. 

The  production  levels  of  other  crops  have  remained  comparatively  low.  During  the  2011/12  season 

production  was  mixed  with  some  crops  recording  significant  increases  while  other  experienced  notable 

drops.  Despite the extended dry spells experienced in the southern half of the country during the growing 

season,  official  production  estimates  from  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  estimate  only  a  slight  drop  (6 

percent) in maize production. This has been partly attributed to increased use of hybrid seed among small 

scale farmers. Furthermore, the reduction in planted area with respect to the previous season was minimal 

(only  6  percent).  According  to  official  government  estimates,  maize  production  for  the  2011/12 

production season has been pegged at 2.85 million MT. Although this is a drop from the 3.02 million MT 

 | P a g e  

 

10 

attained  in the 2010/11 season, this  figure  is still  well above the recent five  year average  of 2.1  million 

MT. 

The  erratic  rainfall  experienced  in  the  southern  half  of  the  country  resulted  in  a  reduction  in  the  area 

harvested for  maize  in Central, Southern, Lusaka and  Western Provinces and therefore a drop  in  output 

(see Figure 1). However, this drop was significantly lower than what was expected. Although the impact 

on crops was severe in localized parts of the affected districts, in other areas production was good making 

up for losses. Similar to  maize,  cassava output for the 2011/12 production season  has been  estimated to 

decline only marginally (2%) with respect to the previous season. 

Figure 1. Maize production by province  in MT 
(2011/12 vs. 2010/11) 

 

Despite  the  fact  that  the  country  is  producing  substantially  less  non-food  staples  including  tobacco  and 

maize  seed,  considerable  increases  were  made  in  the  cash  crop  production  of  cotton  (121  percent)  and 

soybeans (74 percent)  when compared to the previous production season. These changes  were primarily 

driven by attractive prices in the 2011/12 marketing season (see Figure 1). The impact of the 56 percent 

reduction  in  maize  seed  production,  (predominated  by  commercial  farmers),  on  seed  supply  in  the  next 

season  remains  to  be  seen.  The  cut  back  on  maize  seed  production  was  attributed  to  the  large  seed 

carryover from the previous production season by seed companies. Commercial farmers preferred to cut 

back on maize grain and seed but increase their soybean production, while small scale farmers continue to 

dominate cotton production.

 National Food Supply for the 2012/13 Marketing Season 

The  National  Food  Balance  sheet  for  the  2012/2013  marketing  season  released  by  the  Ministry  of 

Agriculture  and  Livestock  (MAL)  shows  that  the  country  has  produced  more  than  sufficient  maize  to 

meet the total national requirement. National maize production has been estimated at 2,852,687MT, while 

the  unusually  large  carryover  stock  stands  at  770,931MT  giving  a  total  maize  availability  of 

3,623,619MT.  This  implies  that  Zambia  has  a  large  maize  surplus  of  1,035,333MT  which  will  be 

available for export.

Similar  to  past  years,  sorghum,  millet  and  cassava  are  expected  to  be  adequately  available  to  meet 

domestic requirements this year while an estimated 12,583MT of rice imports will be needed to meet the 

national shortfall. In line with the substantial increase in local wheat production in recent years, Zambia is 

expected to produce adequate wheat to meet supply with an estimated exportable surplus of 96,271MT.

Food Access 

The  food  security  situation  during  the  2011/12  marketing  and  consumption  season  had  been  stable 

following  successive  years  of  surplus  production  which  had  kept  markets  well  supplied  and  staple  food 

prices within average to below average  levels  even  in  deficit producing areas. Another consecutive  year 

of surplus production and large carryover of staple food will guarantee adequate staple food supply on the 

market at below average levels to the benefit of market dependent households. The increasing food supply 

and variety at household level will generally be increasing food access while reducing dependency on the 

market especially in rural areas.   

The FRA has announced its plan to purchase a total of 500,000 MT of maize from the small scale farmers 

during the June to October 2012 period to  go towards strategic reserves. The balance  of the  marketable 

surplus is expected to be purchased by the private sector for local sales and  export. During the previous 

marketing  season,  the  FRA  bought  up  to  1.75  million  MT  from  the  small  scale  farmers  while  offering 

prices above the market value (up to 40% above) and crowding out the private sector from active market 

participation. These large purchases in the previous year meant that most of the maize was and is still in 

the hands of the FRA which created pressure on the limited storage space resulting in some stock going to 

waste.  With  the  intended  reduced  FRA  maize  purchases  in  the  midst  of  a  1.04  million  MT  surplus,  the 

private sector will be encouraged to participate in the maize market. Furthermore, it is unlikely that most 

farmers will  manage to sell their maize at the FRA  minimum price  of K65, 000/50Kg with FRA having 

reduced quantities to purchase from the market. In view of the large maize supply (production and carry 

over stock), the maize market is likely to become a buyer’s market with buyers determining the prices. In 

most  cases,  small  scale  farmers  are  likely  to  sell  at  prices  below  K  65,  000/50Kg  as  maize  floods  the 

market and farmers become desperate to dispose of their maize due to inadequate storage and immediate 

need for cash. Producers  will therefore  earn  less per unit  with respect to the previous season. However, 

they will have higher retention for their own consumption.

The Agency’s maize stock levels are estimated at 500,000 MT after selling purchased stocks locally and 

exporting  about  500,000  MT  in  the  region.  Since  November,  the  FRA  has  been  selling  maize  on  the 

market at fixed prices ranging from $140/MT (rural) to $170/MT (urban) to create room for storage of the 

new harvest. The continued sale of maize at fixed prices has kept prices relatively stable even at the peak 

price period of February/March. Maize prices have generally remained below last season’s level and the 

recent five year average (Figure 3).   

Most  markets  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas  continue  to  be  adequately  supplied  with  staple  foods 

supporting stable prices even in areas that experienced erratic rainfall making staple food more accessible 

to market dependent households.  

Maize  prices  are  expected  to  decline  as  the  new  harvest  reaches  the  market  and  household  food  stocks 

increase  reducing  market  demand  for  staple  food  especially  in  the  rural  areas.  Low  producing  areas  are 

expected to benefit from the reduced prices and increased cereal flow from surplus to deficit areas making 

staple food more accessible. In order to avoid collapsing prices for producers, there is need to put in place 

an  aggressive  export  plan  and  take  advantage  of  the  export  ban  in  Malawi  and  the  reduced  surplus  in 

South  Africa.  At  the  same  time,  this  will  ensure  reduction  of  storage  losses  and  firm  up  local  prices  in 

support of the producers.

2.2.3. Livestock Situation 

Livestock production continues to be a major livelihood among small scale farmers in many parts of the 

country.  The  production  of  major  livestock  such  as  cattle,  goats  and  pigs  is  concentrated  in  three 

provinces,  namely  Central,  Southern  and  Western  Provinces.  Based  on  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and 

Livestock statistics, cattle  have the largest share  of the major livestock population at 55%, with  goats at 

35%  while  pigs  make  up  only  10%.  In  the  past  number  of  years,  cattle  production  has  severely  been 

disrupted  by  recurring  disease  outbreaks,  with  the    common    ones    being    Foot    and    Mouth    Disease  

(FMD),  East  Coast  Fever,  Contagious   Bovine Pleuro-pneumonia (CBPP) and  Anthrax. The FMD is 

endemic in Sesheke (Western Province), Kazungula (Southern Province), Mbala and Nakonde (Northern 

Province), but in 2004 spread to parts of Central and other Southern Province districts. CBPP is endemic 

in  areas  of  Western  Province,  North-  western,  Southern  (Kazungula)  and  extreme  Northern  Province 

Districts.  East  Coast  Fever  areas  include  Eastern,  Southern,  Central,  Lusaka  and  Northern  Provinces 

while outbreaks of Anthrax are mostly confined to Western Province. 

Most of the areas affected by these diseases are also prone to drought and occasionally floods. Livestock 

movement  bans  associated  with  control  measures  often  disrupts  the  cattle  trade,  affecting  farmers,  beef 

traders  and  consumers  of  cattle  products.  This  often  exacerbates  farmers’  vulnerability  to  the  effects  of 

drought/floods especially in Southern province by taking away the means to cultivate their land (draught 

power)  as  well  as  one  of  the  most  reliable  income  sources  (Tembo,  et.al.,2006).  Under  normal 

circumstances, in these farming systems,  livestock acts as some form  of  insurance against poor  weather 

and subsequent crop failure while also providing the farmers with income during difficult times. 

 

2.3. Nutrition 

More  than  a  third  of  deaths  of  children  under  the  age  of  five  years  and  disability-adjusted  life  years 

worldwide  can  be  attributed  to  under  nutrition,  making  it  the  largest  risk  factor  in  any  age  group  for 

global burden of disease (Black et.al, 2008).  Under nutrition encompasses stunting, wasting, underweight 

and  deficiencies  of  essential  vitamins and  minerals (micronutrients).  Stunting, severe  wasting and intra 

uterine growth restrictions are together estimated to be responsible for 2.2 million deaths and 21% of the 

Disability - Adjusted Life - Years (DALYs) for children under five years (Ibid.).  Deficiencies of vitamin 

A  and  zinc  were  estimated  to  be  responsible  for  0.6  million  and  0.4  million  deaths  respectively  and  a 

combined  9%  global  childhood  DALYs  worldwide.    Furthermore,  sub-optimal  breastfeeding  was 

estimated to be responsible for 1.4 million child deaths and 10% of DALYs in children under five years 

 | P a g e  

 

15 

(Ibid.).    Therefore,  good  nutrition  is  a  prerequisite  for  economic  development  (Victoria  et.al,  2008).  

Furthermore,  undernourished  children  are  more  likely  to  be  stunted  into  adulthood,  have  lower 

educational  achievements  and  give  birth  to  smaller  infants.    Maternal  and  child  under  nutrition  are  also 

associated with lower economic status with effects that spill over to future generations.    It is also worth 

noting  that  the  time  from  pregnancy  to  24  months  of  age  presents  a  crucial  window  of  opportunity  for 

reducing  under  nutrition  and  its  adverse  effects”  (Bryce  J.  et.  al.  2008).    Programme  efforts  should 

therefore focus on this segment of continuum of care.  

 

In Zambia, despite improvements in the levels of stunting and underweight from 47% and 28% in 2001 to 

45% and 15% in 2007 respectively (CSO, 2009), under nutrition remains a serious public health concern.  

In rural and urban areas stunting has declined from 51% in 2001-2 to 42% in 2007 and from 37% to 33% 

respectively during the same reference period (Ibid.). Stunting signifies long term deprivation of adequate 

nutrition and  may be  coupled  with recurrent and  chronic  illnesses.   Acute  malnutrition (wasting)  levels, 

however, have remained the same (5%).   Wasting reflects current inadequate food intake and/or current 

illness, while underweight is a composite of both short and long term nutritional inadequacies.   

 

Micronutrient  malnutrition  arising  from  the  deficiencies  of  vitamin  A,  iodine,  iron  and  zinc  are  most 

likely to co-exist with other forms of under nutrition discussed above.  According to the NFNC, 54% of 

all  children  fewer  than  five  years  were  vitamin  A  deficient,  whereas  53%  were  iron  deficient  in  2003 

(NFNC, 2003).  These prevalences are of public health concern as they are well above the WHO cut-off 

points of 10%.  For vitamin A deficiency, this can largely be attributed to inadequate dietary intake of the 

micronutrient.  Iron deficiency on the other hand, is a result of inadequate dietary intake as well as public 

health  problems  such  as,  high  malaria  incidence,  worm  infestations  and  bilharzia.    The  government  of 

Zambia  has  put  in  place  interventions  including  vitamin  A  and  iron  supplementation  programmes  for 

vulnerable groups to include children and women of reproductive age group to alleviate the problem.     

 

Breastfeeding, in particular exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a child’s life, is one of the 

key strategies for child survival both in the general population as well as in the context of HIV.  There has 

been an improvement in the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the general population from 41% in 2002 to 

61%  in  2007  (CSO,  2009).    Following  exclusive  breastfeeding,  the  timely  introduction  of  adequate 

 | P a g e  

 

16 

complementary foods with continued breastfeeding up to 24 months or beyond  is cardinal for continued 

proper growth, development and child survival.  There has been an increase in the proportion of mothers 

who  introduce  complementary  foods  to  their  infants  aged  between  6  and  9  months  of  age  from  87%  in 

2001/2 to 93.7% in 2009 (CSO, 2003/9).     

 

The  prevalence  of  the  afore-mentioned  forms  of  under  nutrition  are  likely  to  be  more  pronounced  in 

emergency and disaster situations where household livelihoods are disrupted, There is therefore a need for 

interventions and social safety nets to alleviate the negative consequences for vulnerable disaster affected 

populations.  

 

2.4. Health 
 

The  critical  impact  of  health  on  national  development  cannot  be  overstated  and  therefore  health  care 

delivery  remains  a  top  priority  of  the  Zambian  government.  According  to  the  2008  Ministry  of  Health 

Annual  Report,  the  Ministry  of  Health  recorded  several  achievements  in  its  quest  to  ensure  equity  of 

access  to  cost-effective  quality  health  care  services  as  close  to  the  family  as  possible.  However,  the 

country still had some disease burden to deal with. 

The top ten causes of health facility visitation for all age groups in the annual health statistical bulletin of 

2011 were the same as those recorded in 2010. These were  malaria (252/1000), respiratory Infection (non 

pneumonia) (198/1000), diarrhoea (non bloody) (69/1000), trauma (47/1000), skin  Infections (38/1000), 

muscular  skeletal  and  connective  tissue,  eye  infection  (31/1000)  respiratory  infections  (pneumonia) 

(30.8), skin infection (30.5/1000) and ear/ nose / throat infection (27/1000). 

 

Progress  was  made  in  the  area  of  disease  prevention  and  mitigation  with  a  reduction  in  the  nationwide 

malaria  parasite  prevalence  from  22%  in  2006  to  10%  in  2008.  The  National  Malaria  Control  Centre 

continued to scale-up Malaria interventions through: 

i.  Prevention  of  malaria  in  pregnancy  by  distributing  Insecticide  Treated  Nets(ITNs)  to  ante-natal 

mothers (874,293) national wide  

ii.  Scale up of Indoor Residual Household Spray(IRHS) to 36 districts 

 | P a g e  

 

17 

iii.  Conducting of  entomological and parasitological surveys in the 10 sentinel survey districts 

iv.  And  strengthening  of  case  management,  improved  availability  of  anti-malaria  drugs  and  diagnostic 

facilities with emphasis on Rapid Diagnostic Testing Kits (RDTs). 

 

The 2008 Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) results showed ITN coverage as follows: 

   Table 3: 2008 MIS Results: ITN coverage

Percentage of children 0-59 months that slept under an ITN 

Percentage of pregnant women that slept under an ITN 

Percentage of households that slept under an ITN 

38 % 

40 % 

60 % 

 

Child health programmes also progressed well with the percentage of fully immunized children under the 

age  of  one  increasing  from  86%  in  2007  to  90%  in  2008.  Health  worker  training  in  Integrated 

Management  of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI)  was also scaled up. Increase  was also noted in  ARV uptake 

by HIV  infected  infants from 17% in 2007 to 29%  in 2008. Pediatric  Anti- Retro  Viral Therapy (ART) 

uptake increased from a cumulative total of 12,000 to 18,040. 

 

Under the Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care plan (EmONC), 18 districts will be strengthened each 

year.  The  plan  also  involves  staff  training,  infrastructure  maintenance  and  provision  of  equipment. 

Currently, EmONC has been scaled up in at least two districts in all the nine provinces of Zambia. 

The  continued  scale-up  of  Highly  Active  Anti-Retro  Viral  Therapy  (HAART)  provision  has 

resulted in the number of ART centres increasing from 197 in 2007 to 419 in 2008. In addition to 

the ART centres, there are a number of VCT centres run by NGOs and faith based organization. 

These two factors contributed to the observed  increase  in the number of clients accessing  ART 

from  156,783  in  2007  to  219,576  in  2008.  With  the  continued  integration  of  Prevention  of 

Mother  to  Child  Transmission(PMTCT)  programs  into routine  reproductive  health  services  the 

number of HIV positive mothers accessing PMTCT services rose from 58,577 in 2007 to 69 963 

in 2008. 

 | P a g e  

 

18 

Drug  availability  like  is  an  important  component  in  the  delivery  of  good  and  quality  health 

services.  The  demand  for  provision  of  quality  health  services  is  determined  by  among  other 

factors, availability of essential drugs, qualified medical personnel, supplies and equipment.  

The Ministry of Health Annual Report for 2008 shows that there was a slight decline in the percentage of 

drug availability in health centres from 70 % in 2007 to 69 % in 2008, while the percentage of availability 

of  drug  in  hospitals  declined  from  84  %  in  2008  to  77  %  in  2008.  The  drug  kit  utilization  for  all  the 

provinces  however  showed  an  increase  from  0.75  in  2007  to  0.95  in  2008.  Regardless  of  these 

fluctuations in the availability and utilization of drugs in the health sector the Ministry of Health has not 

relented  in  the  continued  procurement  and  supply  of  essential  drugs,  health  centre  kits  and  community 

health worker kits to all the districts in the country. 

2.5. Water and Sanitation 
 

The  country’s  vision  on  water  and  sanitation  is  to  ensure  that  all  Zambians  have  access  to  water  and 

sanitation  and  utilize  them  in  an  efficient  and  sustainable  manner  for  wealth  creation  and  improved 

livelihood by 2030. In its quest to realize this vision, the government has put in place strategic measures 

to  improve  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  as  well  as  mitigate  impacts  resulting  from  floods  and 

droughts.  In  addition,  the  separation  of  Water  Resources  Management  and  Development  (WRMD)  and 

Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) sub sectors is another strategic  measure  which the  government  has 

implemented to effectively manage water resources and improve sanitation facilities respectively. In view 

of  this,  specific  government  ministries  in  collaboration  with  key  stakeholders  have  been  tasked  to 

implement programmes which are set to improve water and sanitation situation in the country. Among the 

institutions responsible for the  implementation  of  water and sanitation programmes  include the Ministry 

of Mines, Energy and Water Development (MMEWD) through the Department of Water Affairs (DWA), 

Ministry of Local Government and Housing (MLGH)  through Department of Infrastructure and Support 

Services  (DISS),  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH),  Local  Authorities  (LA),  National  Water  Supply  and 

Sanitation Council (NWASCO) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO’s).  

The Sixth National development Plan (SNDP) 2011 -2015, an overarching national planning framework, 

has outlined performance indicators for the water supply and sanitation sector. For instance from 2011 to 

2015,  the  WRMD  sub  –  sector  has  set  performance  targets  to  achieve  sustainable  water  resources 

development through construction and rehabilitation of water infrastructure. These targets have taken into 

consideration  the  growing  population  and  subsequent  growth  in  domestic  water  demand.  By  2015, 

projected  per  capita  consumption  is  7430  m3/person/year.  Therefore,  such  investment  in  water 

 | P a g e  

 

19 

infrastructure development  will contribute to the provision  of adequate water to the growing population. 

Furthermore, considering potential impacts of climate  change, strengthening  of capacity for disaster risk 

management, mitigation and adaptation was also set as an objective. 

For the WSS sub sector, similar plans have been put in place to improve the proportion of rural and urban 

population  having access to  water and sanitation  facilities. This will be implemented under the  National 

Rural Water Supply and National Urban and Peri – urban Water and Supply Sanitation programmes. 

In  order  to  achieve  the  set  targets,  the  SNDP  has  projected  investment  for  such  developments  for  the 

period 2011 to 2012 (table 1) Water Resources Management and Development during the past three years 

(2009-2011),  the  sector  has  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  improve  water  supply  and  sanitation 

facilities.

The world over, education has been considered as a tool for personal and national development; a position 

that Zambia has embraced. This is evidenced by the country’s thrust in embracing the global declarations 

into  national  educational policies and programmes. Key in this  direction  has been Zambia’s  embrace  of 

education for all (EFA) goals that places emphasis on quality over quantity. 

The  vision  of  the  policy  has  been  translated  into  strategies  which  are  being  implemented  through  the 

National implementation Framework (NIF) for education covering spells of 5 years, the first being 2005 

to  2010  and  the  current  covering  2010  to  2015  under  the  bigger  national  plan  of  the  Fifth  National 

Development (FNDP) plan and the sixth National Development plans. 

 

The current Zambia national education policy document “Educating our Future”, laid down a clear vision 

for reforms of the whole education sector focusing on: 

• 

Increasing access to quality education for all at all levels of the education system; 

 | P a g e  

 

20 

•  Achieving high pupil retention, and progression and completion rates with emphasis on girls and 

the poor and vulnerable; 

•  Supplying adequate trained and motivated teachers and lecturers for all levels; 

•  Reviewing the curriculum at basic, high school and tertiary levels to provide relevant skills and 

knowledge; 

•  Supplying sufficient learning/teaching materials for all levels; 

•  Effective decentralization of education delivery, and; 

•  Management/mitigation of HIV/AIDS. 

 

The government’s thrust on education is to achieve increased and equitable access to quality education at 

all  levels  through  a  variety  of  policy  decisions,  initiatives  /  strategies  and  programmes,  which  are  well 

articulated  in  the  Strategic  Plan  include  the  abolition  of  schools  fees,  support  to  alternative  modes  of 

delivery, introduction  of bursaries to carter for the  most vulnerable. The MoESTVTEE has prepared the 

National  Implementation  Framework  (NIF)  to  guide  the  translation  of  these  policies  decisions  and 

programmes into activities aimed at achieving national policy on education “Educating Our Future. 

 

Over the last 15 years the education system had been characterized by low growth. This manifested in low 

progression  rate,  high  dropout  rate,  low  gross  and  net  enrolment  ratios,  and  the  general  plummeting 

quality.  In  response  the  government  designed  policy  directions  to  address  the  negative  trends.  The  new 

policy directions where characterized by improved financing to the sector. 

The education sector’s share of GDP increased from 2.0 percent in 2000 to 4.2 percent in 2008. Further, 

government  embarked  on  implementation  of  the  Basic  Education  Sub-Sector  Investment  Programme 

(BESSIP  1999-2002)  which  is  aimed  to  increase  access  to  education.  The  introduction  of  free  primary 

education in 2003 has led to a significant increase in primary school enrolment. The Education Strategic 

Plan (ESP 2003-07) introduced the new structure of basic schools (Grades 1-9) and high schools (Grades 

10-12).  The  ministerial  decree  (2009)  guaranteeing  all  grade  9  graduates  access  to  grade  10  is  a  major 

policy development. 

 

A new Education Bill which was in the final stages of stages of development in 2011   was presented to 

Parliament  in  2010/11  and  became  the  Education  Act  2011,  replacing  that  of  1966.  This  Act  will 

incorporate  the  major  policy  changes  since  1996  including.  The  objects  of  this  Bill  are  to  address  the 

following: 

•  Regulate the provision of accessible, equitable and qualitative education;  

 | P a g e  

 

21 

• 

 Provide for the establishment, regulation, organization, governance, management and funding of 

educational institutions; 

•  Domesticate the Convention on the Rights of the Child in relation to education; 

•  Legalization of community schools 

 

These  policy  documents  place  special  emphasis  on  quality  improvements  while  sustaining  issues  of 

access, demand and participation at all level. The other core feature for both policies is to ensure that, in 

the effort to deliver quality and improved educational services to the public, it was paramount to track and 

monitor sector performance as well as establish a base on systemic planning. This meant that the massive 

investments that were ploughed in the system were subjected to frameworks that ordinarily were there to 

ensure  evidence  based  formulation  and  result  oriented  program  implementation  and  monitoring  efforts 

were carried out at strategic levels. 

 

In view of the aforementioned point, as from 1999, the sector had embarked on strategic implementation 

frameworks  which  amongst  which  Basic  Education  Sub-Sector  Investment  Programme  (BESSIP)  from 

1999-2002.  This  framework  was  specifically  designed  to  accelerate  the  achievements  of  pronounced 

policy  targets  for  mid  -  1990s,  it  embraced  broadening  access  and  participation  as  well  as  improving 

Learning Achievement as its prime objectives with special focus on Basic education. The implementation 

of  this  framework  saw  a  supportive  political  will  and  good  investments  in  the  programme  which  above 

all,  when  complemented  by  the  re-introduction  of  free  primary  education,  accounted  for  the  evidently 

increased enrolments figures at basic school levels and the marginal gains in terms of quality and learning 

achievement. 

 

These  achievements  could  not  hardly  been  achieved  without  a  systematic  and  performance  monitoring 

system,  that  has  been  premised  on  building  an  information  based  for  process  monitoring  of 

implementation,  healthiness  of  the  entire  educational  system,  establishing  of  the  baselines  and  trends, 

consistent production  of  educational  indicators as well as policy performance targets. The  establishment 

of information system has played a key role in all the achievements. 

 

The importance of educational statistics for successful planning and efficient administration in education 

can hardly be over-emphasized. The need for accurate and timely data is being increasingly felt in every 

sphere engaged in the task of educational planning and development.

Therefore, the Strategic plan (2003 - 2007) and Fifth National development (2007 - 2010) both addressed 

the objectives in ensuring that the goal for life-long education for all, which is accessible and relevant to 

individual,  national  and  global  needs  and  values  received  the  highest  attention.  More  importantly,  these 

plans incorporate the core components of MDGs in outlining the issues of access and gender, at primary 

and high school levels. 

 

The  Ministry  of  Education  has  divided  infrastructure  in  three  categories  namely  permanent,  temporary 

and  incomplete structures. The permanent structures are structures built  with  concrete that can serve for 

many years, usually at high cost using skilled labour and quality materials. The temporary structures are 

temporal in nature built as stop gap measure to provide basic infrastructure. The incomplete structures are 

designed  to  be  permanent  structures  but  are  still  under  construction  and  are  often  already  in  use  before 

completed. 

 

Under the National Implementation Framework (NIF) of the FNDP, the Ministry of education in the year 

2008 commenced the construction  of an average  of 1700 classrooms at basic school level annually until 

the  year  2015  and  100  high  schools  (600  pupils  capacity)  to  reduce  the  deficit  in  the  numbers  of 

classrooms  and  both  levels.  At  tertiary  level,  the  Ministry  has  commenced  infrastructure  upgrading  of 

Nkrumah  and  Copperbelt  Teachers  Colleges  into  university  colleges  of  education  and  is  constructing 

Mulakupikwa  University  college  of  Science  and  Mathematics  in  Muchinga  Province.  In  addition,  the 

Ministry  has  started  to  partner  with  the  private  sector  and  other  organizations  in  the  provision  of 

infrastructure  at  all  the  levels  of  education  provision  i.e.  Early  Childhood  Care  and  Education 

Development (ECCED), Basic School, High School and Tertiary level. 

 

 
 
2.7. Social Protection 
 
The Social Protection Sector aims to protect and promote the livelihoods and welfare of the critically poor 

and  of  people  with  the  greatest  vulnerability  to  adverse  impact  of  risks  and  shocks  so  that  they  have 

sufficient livelihood security to meet their basic needs.  

Among  other  things,  vulnerability  can  be  characterized  as  lacking  human  capital,  or  lacking  productive 

capital.  Social  protection  activities  often  address  the  lack  of  productive  capital  by  targeting  people  who 

lack human capital as well as productive assets. Since most households that have deficits in human capital 

are often marginalized from development opportunities, social protection therefore provides for deficits in 

 | P a g e  

 

23 

basic  needs,  and  build  appropriate  and  sustainable  coping  strategies  and  livelihood  mechanisms.  Social 

protection  activities  may  seek  to  assist  such  households  to  cope  at  a  ‘crisis  point’,  or  may  alternatively 

intervene  strategically  to  prevent  or  mitigate  the  impacts  of  risk,  shock  and  shifting  vulnerabilities.  In 

addition, related cause and effects to vulnerability include; gender based violence, human trafficking and 

forced labour which has risen in the recent past. 

In  view  of the above, social protection programmes are targeted to reach priority  groups  exposed to key 

risks, shocks and shifting vulnerabilities. Whether aimed at promotion or prevention, social protection is 

always specifically targeted at key vulnerable groups, forming part of the poverty reduction process, and 

complementing broad based National programmes. 

The apparent  need for social protection in Zambia is clear: there are high  levels of  extreme poverty and 

vulnerability,  which  are  maintained  through  the  multiple  effects  of  HIV  and  AIDS,  poverty, 

unemployment and repeated natural calamities such as drought and floods.  The HIV and AIDS rates are 

more prevalent among  women  compared to  men. This feminization  of the HIV and  AIDS prevalent rate 

has been among others perpetuated by gender based violence, failure to negotiate condom use and limited 

economic opportunities for women. As a result, grandparents have become major care givers for Orphans 

and Vulnerable Children, experiencing increasing challenges in raising income and providing care as they 

grow older. In an emergency situation, the risks and shocks or forces caused by natural calamities tend to 

worsen  the  vulnerability  of  individuals  and  communities  since  the  resources,  assets  or  support 

mechanisms  they  depend  on  are  affected  by  these  disasters.    Furthermore,  many  able  bodied  men  and 

women  of  working  age  are  left  without  jobs,  and  thereby  competing  with  people  from  low  capacity 

households for marginal income opportunities, public works and charity. 

Some of the Social Protection Interventions in Zambia include the following:- 

i.  Food  Security  Pack:  Under  this  programme  farming  inputs  shall  be  provided  to  vulnerable  but 

viable  farmers  at  household  level  to  enhance  food  security  through  crop  diversification, 

conservation  farming,  promotion  of  micro  credit  facilities,  and  alternative  livelihoods.  This  will 

greatly  contribute  to  increased  productivity  of  crop  yields,  livestock  and  household  assets  for 

people in disaster prone areas.  

 

ii.  Public  Welfare  Assistance  Scheme  (PWAS):  This  is  government’s  major  social  assistance 

programme  aimed  at  assisting  the  incapacitated  households  in  order  to  reduce  hunger,  extreme 

poverty  and  destitution.  Under  PWAS  beneficiaries  will  be  assisted  with  education,  health  and 

 | P a g e  

 

24 

social  support.  The  PWAS  programme  is  unique  because  it  uses  a  community  based  approach 

when  targeting  and  implementing  the  scheme.  A  system  which  other  programmes  both  locally 

and regionally have adopted and implemented. 

iii.  Social Cash Transfers: The Social Cash Transfers (SCT) are regular non-contributory payments 

or  money  provided  to  incapacitated  and  extremely  poor  individuals  or  households  in  a  given 

community. This scheme is an efficient and cost effective mechanism for assisting incapacitated 

households  and  strengthening  communities’  resistance  to  vulnerability  as  beneficiaries  use  the 

cash  for  nutrition,  access  to  services,  savings  and  small  investments.  Additionally,  the  SCT 

scheme  has  a  multiplier  effect  on  the  community  as  there  is  direct  investment  in  the  local 

economies  as  the  beneficiaries  spend  the  money  procuring  goods  from  the  local  environment 

there  by  promoting  local  enterprise.  Results  under  this  scheme  show  that  individuals  and 

households  accessing  SCTs  have  seen  notable  improvements  in  their  livelihoods,  increased 

consumption  levels  in  terms  of  food,  investment  in  education,  health  as  well  as  reduced 

destitution. 

 

 

iv.  Child Protection; is aimed at addressing the plight of children including those found on the street 

by  providing  adequate  legal  and  social  protection  such  as  shelter,  education,  food  etc  to  these 

children living in difficult circumstances or in need of care.  Further, Government will construct 

state owned and state-run children homes. In terms of implementation there is an urgent need for 

coordination  and  collaboration  among  all  stakeholders  involved  in  child  protection  programmes 

for effective rehabilitation and reintegration of children in need of care. 

The Ministry of Community Development and Social Services (MCDSS) will continue with the mandate 

of  managing  and  coordinating  all  official  social  protection  activities  within  the  country  in  collaboration 

with  its  stakeholders.  The  Government  recognizes  that  more  needs  to  be  done;  to  support  the  effective 

implementation  of social protection strategies and a  number of  key policy and institutional reforms  will 

be put in place.  

2.8. Human Habitation and Shelter 
 
The availability of adequate shelter is an important pre-requisite to national economic development, as it 

is a basic social need after food and clothing. Any shortfall in the housing sector, therefore, could trigger 

severe  negative  impacts  on  social  welfare,  the  environment,  and  on  the  general  performance  of  the 

national economy.  

 

 | P a g e  

 

25 

Zambia  has  been  facing  a  very  critical  shortage  of  shelter  since  independence.  The  lopsided  pattern  of 

development  between  rural  and  urban  areas  has  resulted  in  very  high  rural-urban  migration  without  a 

corresponding effort to provide appropriate shelter in the expanding urban regions. Moreover, until 1996, 

the  country  had  no  housing  policy  that  could  guide  action  in  the  sector.  The  inadequate  availability  of 

affordable and decent housing leads to poor living conditions and high disease burden.  

 

 

During  the  First  Republic,  the  Government  could  only  provide  few  institutional  houses  for  government 

employees  as  well  as  a  limited  number  of  conventional  rental  housing  under  the  control  of  local 

authorities.  Initially,  squatter  clearance  was  the  official  reaction  to  the  growing  problem  of  illegal 

settlements  in  urban  areas.  It  was  not  until  the  period  of  the  Second  National  Development  Plan  that 

squatter settlements started being recognized for upgrading. Although site and service programmes were 

introduced, these  were  inadequately  funded. Consequently, the proliferation  of unplanned settlements  in 

almost all the urban centres continued unchecked while civic authorities failed to provide them with such 

social  amenities  as  water,  roads  and  sanitation  facilities.  In  1991,  the  total  national  housing  stock  was 

estimated at 1,501,898. This increased to 2,311,988 in 2001. This dismal performance is reflected in the 

current  distribution  of the total  national  housing stock  which shows that about 80 percent  of the  houses 

are informal and poorly serviced or not serviced at all. 

 

Data  collected  by  the  Local  Government  Authority  shows  that  65.8  percent  of  housing  stock  in  the 

country  are  still  traditional.  It  has  been  noted  from  the  VAC  data  that  when  there  are  shocks  such  as 

flooding  these  traditional  housing  units  fail  to  withstand  such  elements  and  an  average  of  10%  of  the 

affected,  require  relocation  and/or  resettling  as  their  settlements  and  shelter  get  damaged  and  in  some 

cases they are completely destroyed.  

 

The  housing  sector  in  Zambia  is  largely  driven  by  individual  and  private  sector  initiatives,  and  has  to  a 

large  extent  influenced  growth in the  economy. However, the rapid  growth  of the sector in the  last five 

years  posed  a  challenge  in  maintaining  and  accounting  for  the  pace  of  this  growth  due  to  among  other 

challenges inadequate provision of support services, ineffective coordination of the various stakeholders, 

poor management information systems and weak enforcement of standards. In order to address the current 

housing  deficit,  Government  will  create  an  enabling  environment  to  provide  affordable,  quality  and 

adequate  housing  to  the  majority  of  Zambians.  Government  will  also  encourage  Public-Private 

Partnerships (PPPs) in the housing development and construction of ancillary facilities.

26 

 

 

The  Government  is  implementing  a  fast  truck  transmigration  programme  where  communities  settled  in 

flood  prone  areas  are  voluntarily  resettled  to  higher  and  safer  lands  to  avoid  the  repeated  experience  of 

same  communities  being  affected  each  time  floods  occur. The  idea  is  that  over  time  such  communities 

would be given chance to rebuild their resilience and better their lives. 

 
2.9. Infrastructure 
 
The  Six  National  Development  Plan  places  infrastructure  development  as  one  of  the  key  sectors  apart 

from  Agriculture  that  would  drive  the  Zambian  Economy  to  meet  the  vision  2030.  Development  of 

infrastructure is also one of the key poverty reduction mechanisms that the government has put in place to 

contribute  towards  improving  the  living  conditions  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  communities.  Most  of 

Zambia’s  major  road  infrastructure  was  constructed  in  the  1970s.  The  age  of  the  drainage  facilities 

(culverts  &  bridges)  coupled  with  vandalism  (mostly  on  corrugated  metal  ARMCO  pipes)  effects  have 

resulted  in  considerable  damage  from  inclement  weather.  The  condition  of  roads,  bridges  and  culverts 

have  become  generally  bad.  The  country  has  for  the  past  three  consecutive  seasons  experienced  floods 

which have had an impact on infrastructure.  

 

The  country  depends  mainly  on  gravel  and  feeder  roads  connecting  districts  and  wards  to  each  other 

especially  in  rural  areas.  This  is  a  vital  and  strategic  link  for  the  supply  of  goods  and  services  to  the 

communities  in  various  parts  of  the  country.  Government  has  encouraged  the  establishment  of  schools 

and health centers in the rural areas through community development programmes such as rehabilitation 

of existing infrastructure. According to the LCMS (2004), the most widespread infrastructure projects in 

the  rural  areas  are  rehabilitation/resurfacing  of  roads,  provision  and  improvement  of  education 

infrastructure  and  health  facilities.  However  despite  all  this,  most  of  the  infrastructure  especially  in  the 

educational sector remains in a poor state as most community schools are built from pole and mud.

3.0. FINDINGS 
 
3.1. General Demographics 
 
The  disaggregation  of  location  of  the  communities  in  the  eighteen  districts  showed  that  86.6 

percent  of  the  communities  were  rural  while  13.4  percent  were  urban.  Of  all  the  households 

interviewed,  83.3  percent  were  male-  headed  while  16.7  were  female  headed.  The  survey 

recorded only 0.4 percent of child – headed households.  

 

In terms of age, majority of the households (30.8 percent) in the survey were in the 30 – 40 year 

old bracket. Households that were managed by elderly people above the age of 60 years made up 

14.4 percent of the population in the 18 districts. 

 

The  survey  established  that  most  of  the  household  heads  in  the  surveyed  districts  had  at  least 

primary  education  or  better.  Those  that  indicated  to  have  primary  education  made  up  51.6 

percent of the population while 33.9 percent  indicated to have attained secondary education. A 

further  4.9  percent  indicated  to  have  attained  tertiary  education  while  the  remainder  had  never 

been to school. 

It was also established that 79.9 percent of the household heads were married while 10 percent 

indicated as  being widowed.  A  small  number (2.2 percent)  indicated having  been separated. A 

further  4.2  percent  indicated  being  divorced.  The  survey  further  established  that  the  average 

family size for the surveyed area was six. 

The  In-depth  assessment  survey  conducted  in  eighteen  (18)  districts  established  that  a  total  of 

353, 002 people (58, 834 households) were negatively impacted upon by the 2011/12 floods and 

dry  spell  situation.  Of  those  negatively  impacted  upon,  76.7  percent  indicated  having  been 

affected  by  dry  spells.  It  should  be  emphasized  that  this  figure  represents  the  total  number  of 

people and  households affected in one way or the other and does not in any way represent any 

sector based population.

28 

 

3.2. Early Warning and Preparedness Measures  

The  assessment  established  that there  was  a  slight  improvement  on  the  number  of  people  who 

were warned about the flooding or the dry spell situation from last season. The survey indicated 

that  30.9  percent  of  people  in  the  surveyed  districts  indicated  having  been  warned  of  the 

impending hazard, which is about 10 percentage points better than the previous season. Majority 

of  those  that  indicated  having  been  warned  (87.1  percent)  said  the  information  came  from  the 

Zambia Meteorological Department (ZMD). A further 4.8 percent indicated having been warned 

of  the  impending  hazard  by  the  District  Disaster  Management  Committee  (DDMC).  These 

messages  were  mainly  prepared  and  transmitted  through  electronic  media  by  the  Zambia 

Meteorological Department (48 percent).  

 

From  the  number  of  households  receiving  early  warning  messages,  it  would  be  important  to 

revamp the early warning systems and also find an effective way of passing such information to 

the public. It will be imperative to raise the number of people getting early warning messages. 

 

3.3.  Livelihood  Sources,  Asset  Ownership,  Expenditure  Patterns  and  Food  Consumption 

Scores 

3.3.1. Livelihood Sources 

One of the elements that play an important role when it comes to the in depth analysis of the households 

well  being  are  types  and  number  of  assets  owned  as  well  as  the  the  viability  of  the  income  sources  as 

these  contribute  towards  alleviating  poverty.  Most  households  ability  to  meet  their  day-to-day 

expenditures  on  food  and  non  food  items  is  dependent  on  the  viability  of  their  income  sources.  This 

section  also  higlights  the  importance  of  assets  in  determining  a  household’s  well  being.  This  is  in  line 

with the World Development Report (2000/01) which states that physical assets lie at the core of whether 

an individual, household or group lives in poverty.”. 

 

Livelihoods  of  people  in  any  given  locality  do  determine  the  resilience  levels  depending  on  how  viable 

they  may  be.  This  is  paramount  as  it  determines  the  ability  of  people  and  community  at  large  to 
29 
 | P a g e  

 

sustainably mitigate the negative impacts that disasters bring. Despite people residing in the same locality, 

it  is  very  possible  that  they  will  be  impacted  different  by  disasters  due  to  variations  in  their  livelihhod 

base. The 2012 impact assessment has shown that the main livelihoods of people from the eighteen (18) 

surveyed  districts  haveremained  the  same  when  comparing  2011  and  2012.  This  finding  is  expected  as 

people’s livelihoods do take long to change considering that factors they instigate such like environment 

changes  take  long  to  show  impacts.  This  further  confirms  that  the  prolonged  dry  spells  and  subsequent 

flooding did not have severe impact that would have necessitated changes in the livelihood patterns.

poor food consumption score.

surveyed  districts.  Of  the  4%  of  the  household  with  poor  food  consumption  scores,  90%  are  asset  poor 

with  10%  asset  medium.  The  assessment  has  further  shown  that  of  the  16%  of  households  that  have 

borderline food consumption score, 82% are asset poor with 18% asset medium. Notably the assessment 

has  also  shown  that,  of  the  80%  of  households  that  have  good  food  consumption  scores,  62%  are  asset 

poor  with  38%  asset  medium.  This  implies  that  despite  having  poor  to  medium  asset  base,  most  of  the 

households  that  are  predominantly  rural  based  continue  to  have  good  dietary  diversity  largely  due  easy 

access to own produced foods as well as seasonal foods during assessment period. 

Figure 10: Food Consumption Score for Assessed Districts 

 | P a g e  

 

35 

It is very clear that female headed households do face challenges in meeting the adequate dietary diversity 

as  shown  in  figure  11  above.  The  assessment  has  shown  that  82%  of  the  male  headed  households  have 

good  food  consumption  score  compared  to  75%  of  the  female  headed  households.  The  assessment  has 

further  shown  that  more  female  headed  households  (20%)  have  their  food  consumption  scores  falling 

within borderline (See figure 11). As already stated, the ability to ensure adequacy in the foods consumed 

at household level depends on the household wealth categorization they fall under hence making assets to 

be  an  important  factor  in  their  well  being.    In  view  of  this,  the  assessment  has  shown  that  86%  of  the 

female  headed  households  were  asset  poor  compared  to  61%  of  the  male  headed  with  39%  of  male 

headed households been asset medium compared to 14% of the female headed. 

 

3.3.4.  Expenditure Patterns

37 

been on food expenditure, it is clear that wealth category does play a major role on non food expenditure 

such as transport. In this regard the assessment has shown that a substantial proportion of households who 

are asset poor spent less that ZMK 200,000 on transport as shown in figure xxxx below.  

Majority  of  those  of  households  that  spent  more  than  ZMK  250,000  on  transport  were  predominantly 

asset rich (46%). Generally  most  households  within the surveyed  districts spent  very  minimum amounts 

on transport and that is largely due to the locality that is predominantly rural where households prefer to 

walk as opposed to opting for motorized transport.

Generally most of the households that spent less than ZMK 5,000 on health services are asset poor (68%). 

The  assessment  has  further  shown  that  within  the  16%  of  the  households  that  spent  more  than  ZMK 

50,000  on  health  services,  55%  are  asset  poor  while  45%  are  asset  medium.  The  other  factor  making 

expenditure on health higher for households that are either asset poor or medium is the household size. In 

this regard, the impact assessment has shown that most of the households that spent more than ZK 50,000 

on health services had household size of thirteen (13) or more people (31%). 

Figure 21: Household Expenditure on Education 

 | P a g e  

 

42 

households categorized likewise but still spent more than ZMK 200,000 on education generally had larger 

families with a good number in the school going age. 

3.4. Agriculture and Food Security 

3.4.1. Agricultural Inputs 

The  majority (62%)  of the  households  in the  eighteen assessed  districts purchased/acquired  inputs (seed 

and fertilizer) for the 2011/2012 production season. This signifies an improvement in the use of improved 

seed  and  fertilizer  over  the  past  years  when  small  scale  farmers  used  a  lot  of  recycled  seed  and  little 

fertilizer in crop production. 

Figure 22: Percentage of households by source of 

 

 The 

results  show 

that  most 

farmers 

acquired their inputs from a combination of 

FISP 

(Ministry  of  Agric.)  and  own 

purchases indicating that  FISP has to some 

extent  increased  small  scale  access  to  both 

commercial seed and fertilizer even if it may 

not  be  entirely  adequate  with  respect  to  the 

needs.  However,  the  percentage  that  is  still 

using  recycled  seed  is  still  significant  at 

19%.  Households  that  failed  to  access 

adequate  fertilizer  and  seed  for  the  main 

cereal  attributed  their  failure  to  inability  to 

afford  these  inputs  suggesting  that  input 

supply on the market was not the limiting factor. Although most households in assessed districts failed to 

identify the  major limitation to their cereal production during the 2011/12 growing season, a few (13%) 

attributed it to mainly the erratic rainfall experienced in their areas. This again suggests that input supply 

was not the major limiting factor during the last production season.    

 

3.4.2. Impact of Rainfall Performance on Crops and Livestock 

Results show that most of the assessed districts experienced more of erratic rainfall (prolonged dry spells) 

as  opposed  to  flooding  during  the  2011/12  production  season.  Among  the  eighteen  districts,  only 

Luwingu  indicated  having  a  normal  season  while  most  of  the  districts  were  inclined  towards  erratic 

rainfall  problems,  but  to  varying  degrees.  Most  households  in  ten  of  the  assessed  districts  (Mumbwa, 
43 
 | P a g e  

 

Luangwa,  Chikankata,  Mazabuka,  Gwembe,  Kazungula,  Monze,  Namwala,  Sesheke  and  Siavonga) 

confirmed  experiencing  prolonged  dry  spells  in  parts of  their  districts.    The  impact  on  crops  was  more 

severe  in Chama, Gwembe, Mazabuka and Monze based  on at least 60% of the  key  informants  in these 

districts. The impact on livestock on the other hand was mostly low to none with only Gwembe reporting 

moderate  impact.  There  was  little  or  no  impact  of  the  rainfall  performance  on  market  access  in  the 

assessed  districts  implying  that  households  were  able  to  easily  access  markets  during  the  just  ended 

marketing  season.  This  coupled  with  the  fact  that  availability  of  both  staple  food  and  livestock  in  these 

areas remained mostly the same as the previous season when supply was good, means that most areas had 

adequate supplies of these commodities up to the end of the 2011/12 marketing season in April. 

 

3.4.3. Crop and Staple Food Production 

Figure 23: Percentage of households by land  

Cultivated in 2011/12 production season 

 

 

In the assessed districts, 89% of the households 
were  farming  households  and  of  these,  65%  
had access to 1ha and more of arable land, but 
mostly  utilized 
than  1  ha  for  crop 
production-Figure  23.  The  amount  of  land

less 

 

 

 

At least 83% of the farming households in the assessed districts grew maize while production of the other 

cereals  was  negligible  during  the  main  growing  season.  With  the  increased  production  of  maize  at  the 

expense of other food crops, the share of legumes has remained low. Despite the nutritional value and the 

benefits  of  improving  soil  fertility,  only  42%  of  the  households  in  assessed  districts  produced  any 

legumes. The major legumes grown were beans and groundnuts while cowpea production was negligible. 

Most of the households growing legumes had adequate seeds as these were carried over from the previous 

season.  The high production of maize at the expense of other crops including high rewarding cash crops 

has  been  supported  by  the  Government  policies  skewed  towards  maize  production  and  purchase  (FRA 

annual  purchase  program)  for  several  years  now.  Even  small  legumes  that  promoted  household  food

security such as cowpeas have in the last few years become insignificant defying the crop diversification 

drive.  

 

Although maize is the main staple in most of the districts assessed (Figure …….), there are regions within 

the  country  where  cassava  continues  to  be  an  important  food  such  as  northern  Zambia.  Households  in 

Luwingu,  Chavuma,  Zambezi,  Mufumbwe  and  Mwinilunga  confirmed  the  importance  of  cassava  as  a 

staple  in  those  districts.  With  the  exception  of  these  northern  districts  where  cassava  is  a  staple  food, 

negligible  quantities  of  cassava  are  grown  in  most  of  the  assessed  districts,  and  consumption  is  very 

limited. Sweet potatoes on the other hand are more widely grown for home consumption though on small 

pieces of land.  

 

3.4.3.1. Maize Production  

Despite the increase in maize production, and its promotion in even marginal producing areas through the 

Government  input  support  program,  productivity  remains  an  area  of  concern.  The  results  show  that  on 

average,  most  of  the  households  in  assessed  districts  produced  less  than  40  x  50Kg  bags  of  maize  each 

with  only  25%  producing  more  than  40  bags.  In  the  typically  low  producing  areas  which  made  up  the 

majority of assessed districts (represented by Gwembe), at least 70% of the households produced less than 

10  bags  of  maize  each.  Conversely,  most  households  in  the  high  producing  areas  (represented  by 

Mazabuka) produced more than 40 bags of maize while those producing less than 10 bags were only 21%. 

This suggests that in the low producing areas, due to the very low staple food production levels of most 

households,  other  livelihoods  other  than  crop  production  take  precedence  to  enable  the  majority  meet 

their basic food needs.

Reports  of  pre  harvesting  of  maize  were  negligible  with  an  average  of  97%  of  households  in  assessed 

districts  reporting  less  than  50Kg  of  early  harvesting.  Several  areas  which  are  typically  drought/flood 

prone  such  as  Gwembe,  Siavonga,  Zambezi  and  Chavuma  reported  almost  no  pre  harvest  (100%  of 

households  harvested  less  than  50Kg  early).  This  suggests  that  shortly  before  the  harvest  period,  there 

was  no  food  stress  of  concern  in  these  districts  as  they  were  accessing  food  from  their  normal  sources. 

This is also consistent with other results which show no unusual employment of strategies to reduce any 

food stress. The results show that generally households neither engaged in any excessive sale of assets nor 

pulled children out of school or reduced on essential expenditure such as school, medical, inputs etc. 

Off  season  production  in  assessed  districts  was  not  widely  practiced  partly  due  to  limited  wetlands; 

however Luangwa, Chama and Mafinga reported a moderate number (22% to 28% of the population) of 

households  growing  off  season  maize.    Off  season  production  of  vegetables  was  more  common  than 

maize  in  a  number  of  these  areas,  this  being  an  important  off  season  activity.  Districts  reporting 

engagement  in  some  significant  off  season  vegetable  production  included  Mumbwa  (60%),  Chikankata 

(38%), Chama (23%), Luangwa, Mazabuka and Gwembe (21%).  

3.4.3.2. Use of Manure and Conservation Farming 

Despite most of the assessed districts being livestock rearing areas, not much manure is being used in the 

fields.  The  application  of  manure  would  help  improve  the  soils  and  also  help  reduce  application  of  the 

expensive fertilizer. At least 88% indicated that they do not use manure in their fields.  Encouragement of 

use  of  manure by these farmers could help boost the  yields as many small scale farmers apply  less than 

the  recommended  fertilizer  quantities  lowering  their  productivity.  Although  the  conservation  farming 

technique has been promoted for several years now in the drier areas of southern Zambia and the benefits 

have been seen in these areas, the use of this technique is still rather limited. Within the assessed districts 

only 21% of the households indicated using conservation farming during the 2011/12 production season.   

3.4.3.3. Livestock production  

Livestock  rearing  has  continued  playing  a  major  role  in  the  livelihoods  of  households  in  some  of  the 

assessed areas  with the  major  ones being cattle,  goats and pigs.  Among the assessed  districts Namwala, 

Monze, Mazabuka and Mumbwa districts have the highest cattle (>100,000) and goat (80,000 – 140,000) 

population. Although  less in  numbers, cattle and  goat population  is also significant  in the  marginal crop 

producing  areas  of  Sesheke,  Gwembe,  Siavonga  and  Kazungula  with  cattle  population  estimated  at 

30,000  to  50,000.  Results  indicate  that  in  the  major  cattle  rearing  districts,  cattle  numbers  remained 

relatively  stable  or  mostly  dropped  by  less  than  15%  between  2010/11  and  2011/12  season.  This  is 

 | P a g e

encouraging  and  could  partially  be  attributed  to  the  continued  cattle  vaccinations.  Furthermore  major 

disease outbreaks have significantly reduced supporting the relative stability in livestock population.    

3.4.3.4. Food Security Situation 

Analysis of the 2012 data shows that Majority of the assessed districts are food secure even though they 

experienced some shock. Of the assessed districts, 28 percent

3.6.1.  Sickness at household level  (January –March 2012)  
 

The survey disclosed that in all districts affected by floods, roughly 69.5 % reported a household member 

had fallen sick during the period January –March 2012 as shown in figure 1, and gender was insignificant 

in  one  being  sick  during  the  same  period.  More  than  60  %  of  the  households’  members  in  14  of  18 

districts  surveyed  reported  member  got  sick.  Whereas  households  in  Mumbwa,  Luangwa,  Mufumbwe, 

Mwinilunga and Siavonga reported more than 75% got sick in their respective households.

Highest malaria cases were reported for children aged 36-47 months (5.7%) and other age groups 

were even distributed as shown in table1. While ARI, highest number of cases where in children 

aged 36-47 months (10.7%) as like malaria, while lowest in the age group was 6-11months (4.1 

%). There were more diarrhoea cases in children of 12-35 month age group (2.8%), and rest of 

age groups were below 1%.  As  for skin  infection cases were evenly distributed from 12 to 47 

months  of  age.  While  measles  cases  were  highest  in  age  group  24-35mths  and  lowest  in  6-

11mths .There was a noticeable trend in the progression of within the different age groups. The 

rates  of  ARI/cough,  skin  infection  and  measles  increased  with  an  increase  in  age  then  decline 

after 36-47 months of age. 

 

 

3.6.4.  Preference of Health Seeking Patterns   

Of all the  households reporting  illness  in eighteen (18) districts the  last two weeks prior to the 

survey,  44.3%  sought    health  care    (38.9  formal  care  and  0.6%  reported  going  to  traditional 

healers  while  private  care,  pharmacy  or taking  own  medication  accounted  for  less  than  3.3%). 

Those  who  did  not  seek  any  care  cited  among  other  reasons  no  transport  (2.2%),  poor  quality 

service (0.7%), no money (1.3 %) and home based care (0.8).

Other sources of  water are the river/lake, protected and protected and unprotected wells, piped 

water  and  other  unspecified  sources.  Unprotected  sources  of  water  ranks  as  the  second 

commonly  used  source  and  serves  64,743  households  (18.3%).    Rivers  and  lakes  also  provide 

water to 61,091 households (17.3%). This is mainly in places where rivers are in the vicinity of 

the communities and flows are sustained for most part of the year.  In the event of dry spells, this 

source becomes unreliable as the quantity of water diminishes over time.   

A  small  number  of  households  use  piped  water  as  a  source  of  drinking  water.  This  represents 

12.7 % (45,003 households) of the total assessed households. The least used source of drinking 

water is the unprotected well which is accessed by 36,846 people (10.3%).   

At district level, the results further reveal that boreholes dominate as sources of water in thirteen 

districts  namely;  Mumbwa,  Mambwe,  Chama,  Luangwa,  Chavuma,  Mufumbwe,  Chikankata, 

Gwembe, Kazungula, Mazabuka, Monze, Namwala and Sesheke. For Mwinilunga, Luwingu and 

Zambezi, results show that unprotected wells are the major sources of domestic water followed 

by rivers and lakes. Rivers and lakes as wells as piped water are also major sources of drinking 

water. Piped water, rivers and lakes are common water sources in Siavonga and Chama (figure 

33).

3.8.  Education 

The survey showed that cases of  dropping  out of school due to floods or any  other reason  did not occur 

during the season under review. The assessment revealed also, that not a single house hold got displaced 

on  account  of  flooding,  though  there  were  reports  of  infrastructure  being  damaged  due  to  storms. 

Specifically the assessment established that 20 schools in 7 districts were damaged in one way or another 

and  will  require  rehabilitation.  Of  the  school  infrastructure  reported  damaged,  18.8  %  had  their  roofs 

blown  off,  whilst  ratios  9.4%  were  recorded  for  having  developed  cracks  being  in  deplorable  state  and 

collapsing totally. Of the schools surveyed 40% were reported to be unaffected by floods, and only 9.4% 

were reported to be in good condition. 

 

3.9.  Social Protection 

The social protection elements considered in the assessment were rape, early marriage, child defilement, 

assault and sexual exploitation. 

Of the communities visited, 5.1 percent indicated that some parts of their communities were displaced due 

to the flooding. The most common cases of violence against women and children during the floods were 

early marriages (78.9 percent), assault (70.6 percent), sexual exploitation (53.8 percent), rape (14.3 

percent) and child defilement (7.7 percent). 

Figure 47: Types of Violence against Women and Children 

 | P a g e  

 

65 

The  main  perpetrators  of  the  vices  reflected  in  Figure  47above  were  mainly  relatives  and 
neighbors. Of the assessed districts, Mwinilunga (46.7 percent) recorded the highest in terms of 
early  marriages  followed  by  Mufumbwe  (40  percent).In  Zambezi  and  Chama,  early  marriages 
stood  at  6.7  percent.  Mambwe  and  Chavuma  did  not  record  any  early  marriages  (Refer  to 
Figure 48 below).

3.10. Human Habitation and Shelter 

The assessment revealed that out of all the flood affected households in the 18 districts, only 0.3 

percent (1,115) households claimed to have been displaced. This translates to about 6,690 people 

having  been  displaced  in  the  three  districts  of  Chama,  Chavuma  and  Mambwe.  Of  the  three 

districts, Mambwe was the worst affected with 55.5 percent of the displaced population coming 

from that district. Table 49 below shows the break-down of the displaced population by district.

Over 80% of the displaced households owned and lived in traditional type of houses which are 

basically  made  of  pole,  mud  and  grass.  This  category  was  the  most  affected  and  these  house 

types  were  prevalent  in  all  the  three  affected  districts.  It  should  be  noted that  all  the  displaced 

households were actually male headed.  

 

The state of the majority of the houses occupied by the displaced households suggest that these 

are  communities  who  depend  on  subsistence  farming  and  fishing  and  can  not  afford  to  build 

conversional  houses,  hence,  they  build  the  weak  housing  structures  with  pole  mud  and  grass. 

This suggests also that, they have very  low capacity to respond to hazardous situations such as 

floods.  Government  and  other  stakeholders  should  provide  long  term  solution  to  the  these 

communities who have settled in flood prone areas.

4. CONCLUSIONS   

 

The  In-depth  assessment  survey  conducted  in  eighteen  (18)  districts  established  that  a  total  of  353,  002 

people (58, 834 households) were negatively impacted upon by the 2011/12 floods and dry spell situation. 

Of those negatively impacted upon, 76.7 percent indicated having been affected by dry spells.    

The sector specific conclusions are as follows: 

4.1. Agriculture and Food Security 

Generally, most assessed areas were mostly impacted by erratic rainfall and the magnitude varied among 

the  districts  with  Chavuma,  Chikankata,  Gwembe,  Mambwe  and  Mazabuka  being  most  affected.  The 

impact was high on crops while impact on livestock and market access was extremely low.  

The  food  security  up  to  the  end  of  the  2012/13  marketing  and  consumption  season  was  generally 

favourable and this was supported by lack of strong evidence of food stress, as no unusual strategies were 

being  employed by  households to  meet basic food  needs. The Food Consumption Score for  most  of the 

districts was very good.  

The livestock situation was more stable with few districts reporting disease. This implies that the current 

livestock  disease  control  is  helping  to  keep  diseases  in  check.  Effective  control  through  current 

vaccination programs should be supported. 

Based  on  maize  production,  the  5  districts  (Chavuma,  Chikankata,  Gwembe,  Mambwe  and  Mazabuka) 

that  experienced  a  reduction  in  the  harvest  of  the  main  staple  will  therefore  need  to  be  targeted  for 

intervention to sustain the livelihoods of the affected communities. 

 

4.2. Nutrition 

The assessment revealed that about 37.6% of the children started receiving complementary foods before 

the age of six months and therefore, were not exclusively breastfed in the first six months.  This is a cause 

for  concern  for  vulnerable  households  as  the  introduction  of  other  foods  makes  the  children  more 

susceptible  to  illness  such  diarrhoea  which  may  lead  malnutrition.    In  addition,  children  in  vulnerable 

household are already exposed to other factors such as poor water and sanitation and inadequate access to 

health services that compromise their health and nutrition.  

 | P a g e  

 

68 

The overall vitamin A supplentation coverage for the assessed districts was 75.9 percent which is slightly  

below  the  desirable  national  target  of  80%.    The  lowest  cases  of  vitamin  A  supplemantation  were  in 

Mwinilunga (46.7 percent) and Sesheke (58.8 percent). Therefore, there  is need to step up the  efforts in 

order to increase the coverage.  

The  coverage  of  supplementary  and  therapeutic  feeding  programmes  was  low  across  the  districts 

assessed.      This  is  a  concern  as  some  children  requiring  these  services  do  not  have  access  to  these 

programmes  and  may  report  late  for  treatment.    Accessibility  to  these  services  should  be  increased  by 

establishing  interventions  such  as  Community  Based  Theraptic  Care  (CTC)  and  supplementary  feeding 

programmes  in the affected areas.  

 The    results  of  the  assessment  revealed  that  stunting,  wasting  and  underweight  were  co-existing  in  the 

assessed  communities.  The  high  levels  of  malnutrition  observed  in  the  communities  assessed  can  be  

attributed to both chronic and  transient factors. The observed status quo is compounded by the exposure 

of communities in the assessed districts to shocks such as floods and dry spells. In addition to inadequate 

food intake, children in these communities are also from households exposed to high poverty levels with 

limited  access  to  health  and  education  services,  exercebating  an  already  fragile  situation.  There  is 

therefore a need for the implementation of both short and long term interventions to address the prevailing 

situation. 

 

4.3. Health 

The survey found that on average 55 %  of the household  members reported  having Clinical Malaria. In 

seven (7) out of 18 districts in survey the households’ members saw more than 60 malaria cases. Highest 

malaria  cases  were  reported  for  children  aged  36-47  months  (5.7%)  while  Acute  Respiratory 

Infections  were  highest  in  children  of  the  same  age  group.    The  assessment  established  that 

immunization coverage was high in all the assessed districts. 

 

4.4. Water and Sanitation 

The  results  show  that  84.3%  (297,539)  households  did  not  experience  flooding  of  their  water  sources 

during the 2010/2011 rainy season. This response ranked the highest in all the assessed districts except for 

Zambezi where the number of flooded water sources exceeded those which were not flooded.  

 | P a g e  

 

69 

The  number  of  households  from the assessed  districts  who  indicated that they treat their  drinking  water 

was 85,737 represented by 24% of the 353,002 households. This was a significantly smaller population in 

comparison to the 76% (267,265) households who did not use any means of treating their drinking water.  

The methods of water treatment used by respective households varied from house to house and these are 

chlorination, boiling and filtration. From the results obtained from all the households visited, chlorination 

is  the  mostly  used  while  filtration  is  the  least  used  method  of  water  treatment  by  517  households.  This 

indicates that such households obtain water from sources that are likely to contain suspended solids.  

The number of households using traditional latrine facilities showed the highest value, followed by those 

without any facility at all while the bucket method showed the least value. From the results obtained from 

the households sampled, the number of households with flash toilets and VIP latrines are at 3.4 and 1.4% 

respectively which is very low as compared to 65.4% households with traditional latrines. 

 

4.5. Education 

The survey showed that cases of  dropping  out of school due to floods or any  other reason  did not occur 

during the season under review. The assessment revealed also, that not a single house hold got displaced 

on  account  of  flooding,  though  there  were  reports  of  infrastructure  being  damaged  due  to  storms. 

Specifically the assessment established that 20 schools in7 districts were damaged in one way or another 

and will require rehabilitation. 

 

4.6. Social Protection 

Of the communities visited, 5.1 percent indicated that some parts of their communities were displaced due 

to the flooding. The most common cases of violence against women and children during the floods were 

early  marriages  (78.9  percent),  assault  (70.6  percent),  sexual  exploitation  (53.8  percent),  rape  (14.3 

percent) and child defilement (7.7 percent). 

  

4.7. Human Habitation and Shelter 

The assessment revealed that out of all the flood affected households in the 18 districts, only 0.3 percent 

(1,115)  households  claimed  to  have  been  displaced.  This  translates  to  about  6,690  people  having  been 

 | P a g e  

 

70 

displaced in the three districts of Chama, Chavuma and Mambwe. Of the three districts, Mambwe was the 

worst affected with 55.5 percent of the displaced population coming from that district. 

4.8. Infrastructure 

The  assessment  established  that  there  was  significant  damage  done  to  roads,  health  and  school 

infrastructure. About 321 road, bridges and drainage structures were damaged and need to be reinstated. 

These structures include those that were not worked on from the previous season (Refer to the technical 

report on the Washed away and affected Drainage structures by 2011/12.

5. RECOMMENDATIONS 

5.1. Infrastructure 

•  There is need to mobilize funds to rehabilitate damaged infrastructure.  

• 

In the medium to long term there is need for government to invest in the construction of canal in 

the flood prone areas. The construction should be based on the Environmental Impact Assessment 

(EIA) conducted in these areas. 

  

5.2. Agriculture and Food Security 
Short-term  

•  Vouchers to be used in Chikankata, Gwembe, Mambwe and Mazabuka (off-load commercial 

maize)  to  mitigate  the  food  insecurity  in  these  districts  until  the  next  harvest  (July  2012  – 

April 2013). 

•  Labour based mechanisms to be used for relief in Chavuma until the next harvest (July 2012 

– April 2013).  For quantities see table 15 below:

•  Four districts namely Chama, Kazungula, Monze and Sesheke be placed under monitoring 

•  The  Ministry  of  Community  Development,  Mother  and  Child  Health  have  been  engaged  in 

the provision  of safety  nets including relief and  would be a  worthy partner in  implementing 

all Food for Work Programmes.
