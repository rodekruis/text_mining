VULNERABILITY and CAPACITY ANALYSIS

	Hazard Aspect
(El Niño)
	Vulnerability
	Capacities
	Possible Action

	Physical / Materials
	•Deep wells and water pumps easily dried up
•Plants and trees dried up; farm animals were also affected

	•Residents had one source of water/”burabod”
	•Construct a water pump or a deep well that is situated near the center of the barangay

	Social / Organizational
	•No organization could help the barangay find a solution to the loss of water during extreme droughts
	•Willingness of the barangay to create and organize an organization that could help request for water pumps
	•Construct additional water pumps that can be utilized by the whole barangay

	Motivational / Attitudinal
	•Residents are not working together to find an alternative source of water
	•Some residents have already requested for water pumps
	•Arrange for an awareness campaign which would seek to encourage the hunt for more possible sources of water






Output #5b
VULNERABILITY and CAPACITY ANALYSIS

	Hazard Aspect
(LIGHTNING)
	Vulnerability
	Capacities
	Possible Action

	Physical / Materials
	•Most households have electrical appliances
•The barangay is situated at an elevated/high area
	•Each appliance is plugged to only one electric socket which prevents the flow of electric current
	•During such times, residents should unplug their appliances and turn of the main switch


	Social / Organizational
	•People lack knowledge on what to do during lightning/when lightning strikes
	•The people are very cooperative and willing to learn
	•Plan and listen to weather forecasts/news advisory
•Be ready and alert



	Motivational / Attitudinal
	•People don’t usually unplug their electrical devices during lightning
•People tend to “overuse” their gadgets up to the point where they don’t mind even if lightning strikes
	•People are aware that when lightning strikes, they should cover the things that could possibly attract it
	•To be safe, all electrical appliances should be unplugged; people should also stay in safe places

VULNERABILITY and CAPACITY ANALYSIS


	Hazard Aspect
(TYPHOON)
	Vulnerability
	Capacities
	Possible Action

	Physical / Materials
	•Most houses are made up of light materials
•Not all houses are concrete
•Most of the houses don’t have sturdy posts
	•Some concrete houses have strong foundation

	•In the future, residents should construct sturdier posts and build  a better housing foundation

	Social / Organizational
	•The barangay did not immediately gain access to relief items from different government and nongovernment organizations
	•The barangay easily comes together in terms of asking for help from other organizations
	•Identify organizations that could possibly help the barangay in times of disasters

	Motivational / Attitudinal
	•Most of the residents disregard notices from authorities to evacuate to safer places
•Other residents practice ignorance: even if they already know that a life threatening event is bound to happen, they don’t plan and prepare for it
	•Some residents heed the call of the authorities to evacuate
	•People should be made aware or be warned of upcoming typhoons
